Article text: Beerens, 28, netted twice against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday to add to a stunning strike in the previous home game against Bristol City.
"I'm happy for myself," the Dutchman told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"I know I can score more goals than I have so far, but as a team we're working on picking up more points."
Beerens, an August arrival from Hertha Berlin, has missed just the one Championship match for the Royals this campaign and knows maintaining momentum will be key.
"I'm happy I'm the one on the scoresheet for now," he added. "But we stick together as a team to get the job done.
"We travel to Leeds on Tuesday and that's going to be tough, but we have to keep going and we know if we do that, we can get a good result."

Article text: The 22-year-old, who will join City on 1 July, said: "I'm now at one of the best teams in the world".
Silva has made 58 appearances for Monaco this season - including two against City in the Champions League - scoring 11 goals and 12 assists.
He said the chance to work with Pep Guardiola influenced his decision.
"Of course when you have the opportunity of being trained by Guardiola, you don't say no," added the playmaker, who has played 12 times for Portugal, scoring once.
"If not the best coach in the world, he is one of the best."
Guardiola's City finished third in the Premier League this season, securing Champions League football next year.
Silva was integral to the Monaco side that reached the semi-finals, suffering eventual defeat to Juventus, who play Real Madrid in the final on Saturday, 3 June.
Former Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live
I am surprised in that I think that is the one area of the pitch where they have enough options. Manchester City's attack has been sensational this season. Bernardo Silva is very similar to David Silva. I wouldn't let David Silva go, I think he's been tremendous.
You don't know if other clubs were ready to push the button and City thought 'we have got to do it'. There are some players that come along and you have to do it there and then.
Tottenham defender Danny Rose, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live
I played against him away this season and he's the best opponent I faced. It's a great addition and gives Pep Guardiola another attacking option.
BBC Sport's Simon Stone:
Silva was excellent in Monaco's 5-3 Champions League defeat at Etihad Stadium in February and Pep Guardiola decided the Portuguese was a man he wanted. So much so, in fact, that he is prepared to put him among the top five most expensive players in City history.
A product of the Benfica academy, Silva is an attacking right-sided midfield player and is, at 22, just the kind of age Guardiola likes - old enough to understand his role, young enough to absorb the intricate tactical lessons his new manager imparts.
If, as expected, Kyle Walker also arrives this summer from Tottenham, Guardiola will have the raw pace from his full-back that creates the danger - and space - for Silva to cut inside and slice open defences.

Article text: The United States-born 21-year-old was with Dumbarton last season.
"I am excited about the year ahead as I have forced my way into the Republic of Ireland U21s starting XI," he said.
"I was number two for a few years. Hopefully I can keep my spot and get some caps under my belt, which will be a great experience."
Rogers has yet to break into the Dons first team and Danny Ward has arrived on loan from Liverpool to challenge Jamie Langfield and Scott Brown for a starting place at Pittodrie.
So the goalkeeper, who has played three times for Republic of Ireland Under-21s and played 36 times for Dumbarton, was happy to leave on a third loan spell, having also played for Airdrieonians.
"I feel, at this stage of my career, it is important to try and play on a regular basis and going to Falkirk will hopefully give me that opportunity," he told Aberdeen's website.
"It is up to me to go to Falkirk and do well and then to come back next season to Aberdeen and challenge for that number one jersey.
"I feel my career is going in the right direction and I just need to keep working hard.
"Falkirk are a big club who have big expectations and had a good season last year and will be looking to kick on this year."
Falkirk manager Peter Houston told his club website that he regards Rogers as "a fantastic prospect".

Article text: The A9 drops from 150m (492ft) to 20m (65ft) as it enters a valley at the Berriedale Braes.
Transport Scotland will run an exhibition at Berriedale Parish Church in Berriedale on 26 November outlining the proposed work.
The plans will also be made available on the agency's website.
The draft road orders for the work involved will be published on Friday.
Transport Minister Keith Brown said: "The hairpin bend and steep hill at Berriedale Braes has presented drivers with a very challenging road to negotiate - and is why we are working hard towards delivering improvements right along the A9, including at the Braes."
In August, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) called for work to tackle the bend to be accelerated.
The Berriedale Braes were the scene of a lorry fire on 5 August which blocked the road for five hours. A 77-mile (124 km) detour was unsuitable for HGVs.
The SCC said accidents were a "frequent occurrence" and adversely affected businesses in the far north and Orkney.
Transport Scotland said a solution to the hairpin was being progressed.

Article text: The decision comes as some clinicians warned it could put patients at risk.
The unit would carry out complex vascular surgery for potentially life-threatening conditions like abdominal aortic aneurysms.
However, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said this only represented about 20% of its vascular treatments.
The health board insisted the majority of its vascular services would still be carried out at the other hospital sites across north Wales, including Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor and Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
"Currently, around 300 complex vascular surgery operations are carried out each year in North Wales - representing about 20% of our vascular activity - and we are committed to continuing the majority of our work at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital," said Dr Evan Moore, the board's executive medical director.
"Units such as these - which provide a hub for major vascular arterial operations - are being created across the UK, and there is strong evidence that such sites improve clinical outcomes and patient safety, whilst attracting the best staff and help to develop the best infrastructure."
Vascular medicine covers a wide range of medical procedures and interventions, from screening for risks of aneurysms - where weakened walls of major blood vessels could burst - to treating varicose veins, stroke prevention and helping ensure dialysis patients can continue their treatment.
But speaking ahead of the announcement, one consultant physician at Ysbyty Gwynedd raised concerns.
"This is an integrated service, and other aspects of what we do here would be threatened - radiology, urology and gastroenterology to name just a few," Dr Mahdi Jibani told BBC Wales.
Ken Jones of the North Wales Kidney Association added: "If this service goes, it will cost lives, there's no two ways about it."
Arfon assembly member Sian Gwenllian said it represented "yet another example of services creeping eastwards".
But Dr Moore argued that far from hitting services at other hospitals in the region, vascular services would benefit from a specialised hub.
"Hubs such as the one we have planned, built on the considerable knowledge, skills and practices already here, would protect connected services at these locations.
"These include outpatient consultations, investigations, diagnostic procedures, varicose vein and day case surgeries. It will also ensure strong support for other services such as accident and emergency, urology surgery and renal therapy."

Article text: It is unclear why the helicopter carrying Lionel Zinsou crash-landed in a stadium.
"My father is fine. There were no victims in the helicopter accident in Djougou," Marie-Cecile Zinsou tweeted.
Earlier this month, Mr Zinsou confirmed he would run as a candidate in Benin's 2016 presidential elections.
The helicopter crashed while landing at a stadium in the city of Djougou, a spokesman for Benin's interior ministry Leonce Houngbadji told the AFP news agency.
He said no-one in the helicopter was hurt.
Mr Zinsou, a former private-equity executive, was appointed prime minister of Benin in June.
He has said he will run for president in February's election as a candidate of the ruling Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin (FCBE) party.
Reuters reported in early December that Mr Zinsou's announcement put an end to speculation Benin's president Thomas Boni Yayi was seeking a third term.

Article text: Stan Hollis was awarded the medal for his actions during the storming of the Normandy beaches on 6 June 1944.
A campaign to have a permanent memorial to him created in his home town saw a bar dedicated to him in February.
Middlesbrough Council has now granted planning permission for a bronze statue near the cenotaph on Linthorpe Road.
The statue, which will be almost 7ft (2.2m) high and cost about ??150,000, is to be funded by donations to The Stanley E. Hollis VC Memorial Fund.
Brian Bage, the fund's chairman, said it was "good news" as it had "taken us two years to get this far".
He said the fund needed a final ??30,000 to complete the bronze figure.
Hollis was a 31-year-old sergeant major with the Green Howards when he took part in the assault on Gold Beach.
As his company moved inland, he captured several gun positions and rescued two colleagues, taking more than two dozen prisoners in the process.
As a result, he was the only one of almost 62,000 British troops to be awarded the Victoria Cross on the day of the World War Two landings.
Three months after D-Day, Sgt Maj Hollis was wounded in the leg and returned to England, where he was decorated by King George VI at Buckingham Palace.
He died in February 1972 and is buried in Acklam Cemetery in Middlesbrough.

"The club have done everything they can," Lennon told BBC Radio Scotland.
"It's a purely personal decision for Anthony, but we have a board meeting on Monday, so hopefully we will hear [from Stokes] before then."
Stokes left Hibs to join Lennon's Celtic squad in 2010 and was loaned back to the Edinburgh side in 2016.
Capped nine times by the Republic of Ireland, the forward has netted 131 goals at club level - including two against Rangers in Hibs' 2016 Scottish Cup final win.
"I have had private chats with Anthony, I met him on Wednesday and the talks were positive," explained Lennon.
"But he has a lot of offers and has a big decision to make at this juncture in his career.
"If he decides to come to Hibs, it won't be for the money, even though it is a very good financial package.
"From a footballing point of view, I think this is his home. He has had a great time here in two previous spells.
"He hasn't played a lot of football in the last two or three years and his conditioning would need a bit of work, but I think he is at his peak.

Article text: Spencer White, from the Witterings area of Chichester, absconded from HMP Ford in West Sussex in July 1999.
The 39-year-old, who was convicted of kidnapping an adult, disappeared eight months into a three-year sentence.
After being recognised at Lanzarote Airport on 19 September he was stopped, detained and flown back to the UK.
At Chichester Crown Court on 23 October he admitted escaping lawful custody.
He was sentenced to 16 months, to be served on top of the two years and four months he had remaining on his original sentence.
Police believe White had been living in the Republic of Ireland and was intending to take a short break in the Canary Islands.
Sussex Police confirmed White had not been returned to HMP Ford, a jail which accommodates up to 557 inmates with less than two years left to serve.
In November 2013, police found there were a number of absconders whose cases had not been regularly reviewed.
A dedicated team was set up to review each case and in September 2014 Sussex Police said there were 83 Ford prisoners on the run.
PC Lewis Dines, from the investigation team, said: "Spencer White has been a priority to locate from the moment he absconded but he evaded immediate capture and disappeared [from] our radar.
"Within the last year we received information about his possible location and were able to secure a European Arrest Warrant so he could be arrested if found outside the UK.
"His capture and additional sentence send a message that we will not give up seeking absconders and when we put them back in front of the court they can expect further punishment."

Revenue for the period was $10.8bn, as a result of what the company called "strong corporate demand".
The firm also forecast improved revenues of $11.6bn for the three months to the end of September.

Article text: It follows an interview with Fox News in which he also claimed that there are "Muslim religious police" in London who "beat anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire".
His comments triggered thousands of tweets using the hashtag #foxnewsfacts.
PM David Cameron said the interview made him choke on his porridge.
But Mr Emerson is not the first to get his facts wrong. Here are some other common #fails when it comes to understanding Islam.
Back in October, political comedian Bill Maher made some pretty controversial remarks surrounding Islam on his HBO show, Real Time with Bill Maher.
The city's population estimated at 1,073,045
Christian: 494,358
Muslim: 234,411
Sikh: 32,376
Hindu: 22,362
Buddhist: 4,780
Jewish: 2,205
Other: 5,646
No religion: 206,821
Religion not stated: 70,086
Source: Census 2011
Maher has been critical of organised religion throughout his career, concentrating particularly on Islam.
But this recent debate on the topic got pretty heated when actor Ben Affleck appeared on the panel and called the host's view "gross and racist".
One of the main things people complained about was that Bill Maher was pretty quick to suggest all Muslims have the same belief system.
Although there are several basic beliefs in Islam, there are different groups of Muslims such as the Sunnis and Shi'ites.
The differences within Islam started when the Prophet Muhammad died and there were disagreements about who should lead the Muslim community.
Sunnis and Shi'tes have different versions of the Hadith (the book of Muhammad's sayings) - which means they have a slightly different understanding of Islam.
Overall, Islam is a diverse religion and there are different interpretations of the Qur'an.
A basic issue in this statement is that people often don't fully understand what the garment is.
A burka, sometimes spelled burqa, is the all-enveloping cloak, often blue, with a woven grill over the eyes, that many Afghan women wear.
On the day that France became the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places, the Today programme reported: "About 2,000 are said to wear the full veil and even that is a generous estimate according to some charities."
Other veils which cover the body and face are called niqabs and hijabs - the latter is often simply called a headscarf because a woman's full face is visible.
See the difference between all the veils
No. Only if you live in Saudi Arabia where the law is being reviewed.
In November, a member of the king's advisory council said the country was considering proposals to allow women to drive.
The recommendations from the Shura Council to change the law would apply only to women over 30 - and they would only get to drive before 8pm.
Nevertheless, such a move would represent a major victory for activists after years of rejection of any review of the ban.
Earlier this year, a woman reportedly received 150 lashes for being caught driving.
But Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that forbids women from getting behind the wheel.
The literal meaning of Jihad is struggle or effort, and means more than holy war.
Muslims use the word to describe three different kinds of struggle:
- A believer's internal struggle to live out the Muslim faith as well as possible
- The struggle to build a good Muslim society
- Holy war: the struggle to defend Islam, with force if necessary
In the days since the Paris attacks, Muslim leaders around the world have condemned any use of violence in the name of Islam.
Only if you agree with ex-UKIP leader Lord Pearson.
In 2013, he warned UK Muslim communities were home to "thousands of potential home-grown terrorists".
Such people "hate us with frightening religious fervour," he said, during a parliamentary debate on Islam, in which he criticised Sharia law.
So what is Sharia?
Sharia law, or Islamic religious law, is practised by many strict Muslims.
Some interpretations involve harsh physical punishments for theft and adultery.
Making money from money is not allowed. That means interest on money in bank accounts is off limits, but making a profit through trading is permitted.
There have been reports of growing use of Sharia law by UK Muslims, with several Sharia courts in operation.
But among western nations only Canada is reported to have come close to allowing full Sharia law, but it didn't happen in the end following protests back in 2005.

Article text: Peter Dawson said he was also surprised to hear Rory McIlroy say he "probably won't watch the golf" from Rio on TV.
"Rory is entitled to his opinion but I found it disappointing," he said.
McIlroy is one of a string of players who have pulled out of the Rio Games, citing concerns over the Zika virus.
The world's top four - Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Dustin Johnson and Northern Ireland's McIlroy - will all be missing after raising fears over the mosquito-borne virus, which has been linked to brain defects in newborn babies.
International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach has said the withdrawals will be one of the factors taken into account when the roster of sports for the 2020 Games is confirmed next year.
The Rio Games will see golf return to the Olympics after a 112-year absence.
"We have a great competition, the players are going to have a wonderful experience and the withdrawals are restricted to players from only four countries," Dawson said.
"I am very confident golf has a place in the Olympic programme and we will do everything we can to keep it there."
The Olympics take place from 5 to 21 August, with the men's golf tournament running from 11 to 14 August.

Article text: British Transport Police (BTP) said there were 150 fewer incidents recorded in 2014/15, but sex attacks rose by 16% from 19 to 22.
Overall, 1,172 crimes were reported - down on 1,322 the previous year.
BTP said crime in Wales remained low, but there was still much for the force to do.
Supt Andy Morgan, sub divisional commander for Wales, said sex crime figures in the region were the lowest of any of BTP's eight areas.
He said although it was concerning so many people were affected by this type of crime, the force had expected to see a rise after launching its Report It To Stop It campaign, which encourages victims to come forward.
The force said there were 42 fewer theft offences last year and instances where cables were stolen were down from 102 last year to 53 this year.
As a result, the number of travel minutes lost to the offence is down by 87% nationally since 2008/09.
Violent offences also decreased in Wales, at a time when there was an 8% rise across Britain.
The force said it had put more officers on night trains to deter problem behaviour and it was enhancing its CCTV coverage by trialling the use of body-worn cameras.
The report said there were 16 deaths on the tracks in Wales last year and BTP had introduced a hotline for staff to alert emergency services when staff are concerned about a person planning to harm themselves.
