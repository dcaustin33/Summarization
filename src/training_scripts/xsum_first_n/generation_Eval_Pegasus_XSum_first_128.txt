Article text: At the same time though, they realise the Belgian jihadist's whereabouts was just one strand in a complex and evolving investigation being pursued under the enormous pressure created by the knowledge that their enemy may launch murderous follow-on attacks at any moment.
On Wednesday evening, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins caused consternation when he revealed that "a new cell was neutralised" during the bloody raid of a flat in Saint Denis and that "this team would have been able to carry on other attacks".
Suddenly we realised this was not those who'd escaped Friday's atrocities and that even if Abaaoud was proven to have been there, it was a different cell, heavily armed, that according to some official briefings was about to perpetrate a massacre in the financial district of La Defense.
So we have received a salutary reminder that the journalistic narratives of an "eighth man" or an "escaped mastermind" often get in the way of understanding what is happening in a case like this.
It might be done with integrity (based on official sources leaking information for their own reasons) or it might be no more than a social media echo chamber where some speculation soon becomes a "fact" bemused investigators are then quizzed about.
Their inability to answer some of these questions might be seen as suspicious, whereas in fact it is no more than puzzlement.
The question of how many people the authorities are looking for is in itself a complex one because the number is being added to all the time.
When Mr Molins revealed on Wednesday, for example, that one of Friday's Stade de France attackers and one of the Bataclan theatre killers remained unidentified, it indicated a certainty that once those identities had been established it would generate additional lines of inquiry, raids and quite probably arrests.
There have been so many of these police swoops - several hundred since Friday - that one has to ask whether they are simply taking this opportunity to bring in all sorts of jihadist suspects or whether the list of people they are looking for is much larger than we might suppose.
After all, there are all manner of enablers or supporters who may be questioned for helping jihadist cells or simply complicit by their failure to report certain facts, even if they didn't have a direct role in the attack.
Fanning the flames of uncertainty to achieve maximum effect, the Islamic State (IS) group on Thursday released two videos promising more attacks.
"Christian countries," one speaker warned, "suicide bombers are present in your country in their tens, or rather in their hundreds."
While one might dismiss this as mere propaganda, it's clear there are hundreds of returned jihadists in Western Europe, even if relatively few of them would be prepared to carry out an IS "martyrdom operation".
Returning to the central issue of the 13 November perpetrators and their immediate network, there are reasons for believing it is considerably bigger than the eight men who carried out the attack.
The day after these atrocities, the Iraqi government revealed it had warned France that 25 IS members were on their way from Syria.
Now this may be wrong, not least in that it has not been proven that all of last Friday's attackers were recently arrived from the Middle East, but the discovery of a new, but connected, cell in Saint Denis, and of a car full of guns and explosives in Bavaria (a few days before Paris, but known to have been heading there), provide strong indications that Abaaoud and IS were preparing something more extensive than the eight-man assault that took place.
The news that Abaaoud was indeed one of those who died in the Saint Denis raid of course creates new concerns among intelligence agencies. How could an IS "poster boy" who had appeared in the movement's videos and been on counter-terrorist watch lists across Europe have made his way to Paris undiscovered?
As if this were not already disturbing enough, the authorities have added to the dread. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying: "We must not rule out anything," has suggested that IS may be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons in its attacks.
French police have been authorised to carry their firearms at all times, on or off duty.
Reminding the public of these concerns (IS is believed to have used mustard gas chemical agent against opponents in Syria) may be no more than an ugly necessity at this time.
But of course Mr Valls was on Thursday guiding legislation for a three-month extension to France's state of emergency (giving sweeping powers to the authorities) through parliament.
As in the UK, this involves a difficult public debate about intrusion into people's privacy and the suspension of some cherished civil liberties.
Whatever our uncertainties about the investigation, we have learned enough already to understand that it is a widening dragnet that is expanding across Europe. Multiple raids in the Molenbeek district of Brussels have been generated by intelligence coming from Paris, as well as arrests in Germany.
Each intervention is producing new leads, and there are investigative or intelligence teams across Europe now re-examining earlier incidents, mapping individuals that might be connected to the latest discoveries.
It is a huge task and little wonder that the police or intelligence bureaucracies are taking their opportunity to push for bigger budgets and more people.
At some point, all of this will peak and the number of leads or files being closed off by investigators will start to exceed the new ones being pursued.
Many suspects on the outer edges of the conspiracy or simply in the wrong place at the wrong time will be released. There may even be some sense of relief.
But of course that will simply mark the end of the story of the Abaaoud network and the 13 November attacks.
It would be foolish to think that Islamic State will not be trying to reinvent this model all over again with new teams of operatives dispatched to spread death on the  streets of Europe.

Article text: Alec Bedford later showed a video of the incident to colleagues at Daventry Police Station.
A misconduct hearing in Northamptonshire concluded Special Sgt Bedford had been guilty of misconduct but not gross misconduct.
The officer, aged 26, did not attend the hearing.
For more on this and other stories, visit BBC Local Live: Northamptonshire
Sgt Bedford had been called to a house in Daventry in July 2015.
A 90-year-old man had refused to go to the police station after being arrested.
The man, referred to at the hearing as JA, had been accused of threatening behaviour towards a neighbour and of pulling his wife - JMA - by the hair two weeks previously.
The hearing heard Sgt Bedford had adopted a "confrontational approach".
At one stage he had bodily moved JMA across the room and had then pushed her in to a chair. JMA had scratched his arm and he decided to arrest her.
David Ring, a solicitor acting for the police force, said Sgt Bedford had acted unprofessionally by shouting at and "roughly handling" JMA.
JA was eventually taken to Daventry Police Station. His wife was given bail.
Sgt Bedford later showed video of the arrest to colleagues at Daventry Police Station.
Mr Ring said the officer had "behaved unprofessionally by laughing" and his actions constituted "a very complacent attitude to confidentiality."
Sgt Bedford pleaded guilty to charges relating to the use of excessive force, failing to act with courtesy and deliberately breaching confidentiality.
The misconduct panel's independent chairman, Geoffrey Payne, said: "This was a deeply disturbing and entirely unacceptable matter."

Article text: The online retail giant reported a $92m profit compared to a $126m loss for the same period a year ago.
Sales also rose 20% to $23.2bn in the second quarter to the end of June, boosted by strong growth in the US.
Its shares, which fell 1.3% during the day, leapt 18.5% to $571.24 a share in after-hours trading on Wall Street.
The firm was also upbeat on its prospects for the current third quarter, forecasting sales would grow between 13% and 24% compared to last year, much higher than analysts had predicted.
Sales in North America rose 25.5% to $13.8bn in the second quarter, driven by purchases of electronic goods and general merchandise, helping to drive the strong performance.
Its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, also made a contribution, with sales up 81% compared to the same quarter last year.
It said its widely promoted "Prime Day" on 15th July - which offered special deals to customers who signed up to its fast delivery service - had been a success with more new members trying it globally than any other day in the firm's history.
Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos credited hard work for the results: "The teams at Amazon have been working hard for customers," he said.
Throughout its history, Amazon's revenue has climbed while its profit has hovered around or below zero.
On Thursday evening, the e-commerce company reported a profit.
As customers in North America bought electronics and others products, sales in its biggest market rose more than 25% compared to last year.
And if you thought Microsoft's cloud computing business did well, then take a look at Amazon web services which includes its cloud business - revenue soared more than 80 percent.
The only slight negative was that sales growth outside the US wasn't nearly as impressive.
Still after years of ploughing its cash into new technology , mostly aimed at making it easier and faster for customers to get what they want, the results are starting to pay off - at least in the eyes of Wall Street

Article text: Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said it would be "ready as soon as we receive a list of the opposition delegation".
The warring parties and the world powers backing them have to agree on which rebel groups will be designated as "terrorists" and not represented.
The UN hopes to convene the talks in Geneva towards the end of January.
More than 250,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011. More than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.
"Syria is ready to participate in the Syrian-Syrian Dialogue in Geneva without any foreign interference," Mr Muallem told reporters in Beijing on Thursday following a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.
"We hope that this dialogue will be successful to help us in having a national unity government," he added.
Mr Wang said the Chinese and Syrian governments had agreed on three principles that "should be upheld throughout the whole peace process".
"We should stick to the peaceful resolution of Syrian issue, the people of Syria should decide the future and fate of Syria, and the UN plays a key role in negotiations," he added.
On Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously backed a resolution endorsing a road map for the peace process, including negotiations, a ceasefire and elections.
But the resolution avoided contentious issues, including who could represent the opposition at the peace talks and the fate of Mr Assad.
Mr Wang declined to answer directly when asked if Mr Assad should remain in power. "China's position is very clear. We believe Syria's future, its national system, including its leadership, should be decided and set by the people of Syria."
The United States, which supports the Syrian opposition, wants a negotiated settlement based on the 2012 Geneva Communique, which calls for the formation of a transitional governing body. It says President Bashar al-Assad must go.
Russia, which launched an air campaign against Mr Assad's opponents in September, also calls for the implementation of the Geneva Communique. But it says Mr Assad's future is for the Syrian people, not external powers, to decide.
Most of Syria's political and armed opposition factions now agree on the need for a managed transition but they demand that the president leave at the start of it.
Bashar al-Assad says peace talks cannot begin until "terrorism" is eliminated and that his departure is out of the question before elections are held.
On Tuesday, the head of the UN's Geneva office said special envoy Staffan de Mistura expected to convene the talks "some time towards the end of January".
"Almost everybody wants these talks to be successful, so that we can finally get a political solution to this really unacceptable problem," Michael Moller said.
In a separate development in Syria on Thursday, activists said the jihadist group Islamic State had seized an area previously held by government forces in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 26 soldiers were killed in fighting for the industrial district.

Article text: Kallum Watkins put the hosts ahead and they extended their lead when Danny McGuire's kick bounced off the crossbar and fell for Matt Parcell to score.
Tom Gilmore reduced Widnes' deficit but Joel Moon crossed for a second time and Tom Briscoe sent them 30-6 ahead.
Gilmore and Chris Houston touched down in the second half but Watkins and Parcell scored again to seal the win.
The victory means Leeds are level on points with league leaders Castleford Tigers, who were beaten 26-22 against St Helens on Monday, but have played one game more.
Corey Thompson ran in Widnes' fourth try after the hour mark to make it 30-22 and they could have been within a converted try of levelling the scores, but Gilmore missed the extras.
Despite their spirited second-half comeback, the Vikings could not close the gap and remain rooted to the foot of Super League, having won just once in their opening 10 games.
Widnes also lost Tom Armstrong (knee), Danny Craven (finger) and Lloyd White (hamstring) to injury in the defeat.
It was the first time Leeds had won against Widnes since beating them 38-6 in February 2015, with Denis Betts' side winning their three meetings after that defeat.
Leeds Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott:
"There were a couple of things involved in the second half, not least Widnes' desire to get back into the game. But we were running at 40% in the second half and the last thing we needed to do was give them an invite back into the game.
"Credit to Widnes - they made it a contest but had we done things differently they never would have been able to make it a contest.
"We found ourselves in a situation where we were fighting for the game and credit to our players - they showed some maturity and when they got the chance they got over to score a try.
"I won't get on the players' backs about the second half - it made it interesting and entertaining - but the most pleasing thing is that we were very good and very clinical in the first half."
Widnes Vikings coach Denis Betts:
"At half-time we spoke about treating it like someone taking something from us in the street and then chasing after them and trying to get as much as we can back.
"We got ambushed at the start and we intended to start quickly ourselves. But we were only competing at 60% and got behind in the penalty count and then we just got caught in a whirlwind of incomplete sets and injuries.
"We're down on troops and it's a tough time at the moment. We'd like to take credit for the second half - they ran out of steam a little bit too."
Leeds: Handley, Briscoe, Watkins, Ward, Hall, McGuire, Moon, Galloway, Parcell, Cuthbertson, Jones-Buchanan, Delaney, Mullally.

Article text: The security breach by Norfolk County Council came to light in April 2014 when the cabinet was bought and the social work case files were found.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said the documents included information relating to seven children.
The ICO said the council had "no good reason" for breaching confidentiality.
More news from Norfolk
The council apologised for the data breach and said it had tightened procedures.
Steve Eckersley, ICO head of enforcement, said: "The council had disposed of some furniture as part of an office move but had failed to ensure that the cabinets were empty before disposal.
"Councils have a duty to look after any personal information they hold, all the more so when highly sensitive information is concerned - in particular about adults and children in vulnerable circumstances.
"For no good reason Norfolk County Council appears to have overlooked the need to ensure it had robust measures in place to protect this information.
"It should have had a written procedure in place which made it clear that any storage items removed from the office which may have contained personal were thoroughly checked before disposal."
The ICO added that having the "appropriate staff and procedures in place is key to ensuring councils look after personal information properly".
Simon George, executive director for finance and commercial services at the council, said: "We want to reassure residents that we have robust data protection procedures and have tightened practice in the light of the case published today.
"As a council we take data protection very seriously and we are very sorry that our practice fell short on this occasion.
"In the three years since this occurred, we have taken strong and effective action to ensure it is not repeated."
The county council was fined Â£80,000 in February 2012 by the ICO after a confidential social worker report was sent to the wrong address.

The shopping trolley was hurled through overhead power lines which could have electrocuted the person.
A train hit the trolley, but there was no serious damage to the vehicle or any injuries on board.
British Transport Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
PC Mark Harrington said: "We believe the trolley was thrown onto the tracks before the train struck it.
"It's incredible that whoever threw it was not electrocuted, as the trolley has gone between the overhead wires.
"This was a stupid and dangerous thing to do and could have had very serious consequences, not only for the person throwing the trolley but also for the driver and all the passengers of the train that collided with it.
"This happened in a residential area so it is likely that someone will have seen or heard people by the tracks around the time of the incident.
"I would like to speak to anyone who has any information that could help with this investigation."

Article text: Isabel Gentry, 16, was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary after falling ill on 18 May and discharged four hours later.
Her mother Claire Booty said an initial assessment was "cursory and brief" and she "could hardly walk" when sent home.
In a review after the teenager's death, the NHS Foundation Trust said her treatment was "appropriate".
Isabel, who was known as Izzy, had been revising for exams when she started to feel unwell on 18 May. She was taken to hospital, by ambulance, at 01:00 GMT but was sent home at 05:00.
Ms Booty told the inquest, the hospital had said her daughter had a "viral infection of the stomach".
Avon Coroner's Court heard the teenager "could hardly walk to the car" when they left the hospital after the initial assessment.
Ms Booty said: "Izzy said 'Mum, I can't believe they're sending me home, I feel so ill'. She was not given a chance."
The court heard there had been a possible case of meningitis at her school, St Brendan's Sixth Form College in Bristol, a couple of weeks earlier and all students had been given leaflets explaining the symptoms.
Her mother said Izzy had the very symptoms described in the leaflet.
Paramedic Gary White, who was called out on 18 May, said he had been told the patient might have meningitis but said he "couldn't detect any major symptoms such as a rash or photophobia".
Ms Booty said her daughter "kept asking for the lights to be turned down" in the hospital treatment room.
She also said doctors "seemed to be distracted by another patient who was causing disruption at the emergency department".
The inquest heard that Izzy deteriorated over the day and another ambulance was called which took her back to the hospital at 17:30.
The consultant who treated Izzy diagnosed meningitis and told Ms Booty her daughter was "very seriously ill". Ms Booty told the court the doctor "couldn't believe she'd been sent home initially".
The next day an MRI scan detected Izzy's brain was swelling and she died, on 20 May, 48 hours after being initially discharged from Bristol Royal Infirmary.
The inquest is expected to last five days and will hear from paramedics, nurses and doctors from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust.

Article text: The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project.
The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering.
The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle.
The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link.
"Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing," said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark.
Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations.
These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts.
Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests.
The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area.
Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.

Article text: The National Housing Federation inquiry shows a worker paid the region's average wage - £23,405 - would need close to a £15,000 pay rise to qualify for an 80% mortgage.
The average home in the region costs almost £166,000, more than seven times the average salary.
In Harrogate, North Yorkshire, the average cost rises to 11 times salary.
The NHF report shows Harrogate has an average house cost of almost £277,000, where the average salary is still £24,731.
In comparison it found in Barnsley, Hull, North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire the average house cost less than six times the average salary.
£277,000 Average house price in Harrogate
£166,000 Average house price in Yorkshire and the Humber
£38,000 The minimum salary needed for an 80% mortgage

The cost of renting or buying a home in the region was getting "further out of reach for many", according to the NHF.
Jo Allen, of the NHF, said: "In some places people are completely priced out of their local communities. In others we see areas which need employment opportunities and investment in empty homes."

Article text: The 17-year-old was found in the graveyard of All Saints Church in Didcot, Oxfordshire, in December 2013.
She had been killed by ex-boyfriend Ben Blakeley and hidden in his uncle's grave. He was jailed for life in 2014.
The event, at the Wheatsheaf pub in Didcot, is raising money for a planned charity in her name.
Jayden's mother, Samantha Shrewsbury, said: "A man killed a child who was pregnant and had her whole life in front of her.
"I should have been babysitting last night while she went out and let her hair down, but that's never going to happen.
"I've bought gifts that she'll never receive."
She described the event, which started at 12:00 BST, as a "celebration" of Jayden's life.
"It's also to thank the Didcot people for taking her into their hearts like they have," she added.
Of the planned Jayden's Gift charity, Ms Shrewsbury said: "We want to raise awareness about domestic violence in general but also amongst teenagers."
Eventually, she hopes to provide a safe house for teenage victims of domestic violence.
"I know we can never stop it, but I hope we can make a little dent in her [Jayden's] name," she said.
A bench in memory of Jayden was unveiled in the the churchyard where her body was found in August.
In April, a memorial garden was opened on donated land near the church.

Article text: It was widely anticipated the Spending Review would confirm the need for police efficiencies would remain at the top of the agenda, at least until 2020.
The Home Office is not one of the favoured "protected" ministries shielded from cuts.
And as 71% of its gross spending goes on crime and policing, that is where most of the department's cuts have bitten.
Add to that Home Secretary Theresa May's determination to reform policing, and there was a strong sense the government would not change course.
That was certainly the expectation at Manchester Town Hall, where chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs) had gathered for their annual joint conference.
At 12:30, a large group of them took their places around a television set in a room set aside for exhibitors to watch the chancellor's statement. The mood was sombre. Most chiefs and PCCs had been planning for cuts of 20-25%.
The Inspectorate of Constabulary had suggested that by 2018, forces would have to shed at least 12,000 officer, staff and police community support officer (PCSO) posts, with further reductions after that.
The inspectorate, known for its careful, measured commentary, warned some forces might not be able to withstand another round of cuts, because they were not efficient enough. It said the "operational viability" of some could be "in jeopardy".
The National Police Chiefs Council, which co-ordinates the work of forces, feared the job losses would be even worse - 35,000 by 2020, which, Sara Thornton, who chairs the council, said in July, would be a "game changer".
Constabularies with large urban areas stood to lose the most, as they tend to rely more on Home Office funding, among them Northumbria, which gets 85% of its income from central government, and the West Midlands, 83%.
So, when the announcement came, towards the end of Mr Osborne's statement, that there would be no further policing cuts, there was genuine disbelief, mixed with delight.
Kevin Hurley, Surrey's PCC, described the atmosphere as "euphoric", as though England had won the World Cup.
Essex Chief Constable Steve Kavanagh held his hand over his mouth in shock. "I'm aghast," he said.
At moments such as this, journalists reach for the official documents to look at the small print. Could it really be true?
The Treasury statement appears unequivocal. "The government will protect overall police spending in line with inflation - an increase of Â£900m by 2019-20," it says.
The Home Office press release, however, says the funding will enable individual forces to maintain their budgets at current cash levels.
That means each force will not automatically get enough money to keep pace with inflation. They will get the same in 2019-20 as they are getting this year.
Instead, extra funding will be distributed in certain specialist policing areas - firearms, tackling cybercrime and child sexual exploitation, some of which might be dealt with regionally - as well as to forces that demonstrate efficiencies.
It is that extra funding that enables the government to say overall police funding is going up in real terms.
In other words, the Home Office has accepted arguments that some aspects of policing need more central co-ordination and constabularies that come up with viable efficiency plans should be rewarded. It is called "top slicing" - and that is quite a major change, and one it is easy to overlook amid the relief there are to be no cuts.
The other announcement, which has been broadly welcomed, is PCCs will get more "flexibility" to raise funds for policing from the council tax policing levy, known as the precept.
Until now, the government has limited how much PCCs can raise through the precept, by restricting annual increases in England to under 2%. Rises higher than that require a referendum. Different rules apply in Wales.
The ability to raise the precept by more - how much is not yet clear - could allow those constabularies that rely on it most heavily, such as Surrey and Dorset, to generate substantial extra income.
That the government decided to perform an about-turn on police spending owes much to effective lobbying by police leaders who warned further cuts put the police in risky territory.
A number of senior officers and PCCs made representations to the home secretary over the past few months. They were not shroud-wavers - but people whose views she respected.
They pointed to the growing signs of strain on police forces and their ability to deal with cyber-fraud and sexual offences, reports of which have gone up by 88% since 2012.
The attacks in Paris then cemented the view in Whitehall the cuts could not go ahead as planned.
If the chancellor had limited the cuts to 10%, which police said they could just about cope with, there would have been relief among most chiefs and PCCs.
His decision to go even further, no cuts at all, which took the opposition benches by complete surprise, suggests in the end politics played a key part too.
Presented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy.

Article text: De Luca, 32, has extended his contract with Wasps until the summer, when he will become director of rugby at Uppingham School in Rutland.
After starting his professional career at Edinburgh, De Luca featured for Border Reivers, Edinburgh again and Biarritz before joining Wasps in July.
Wasps are currently top of the Premiership.
Dai Young's side are second in their European Champions Cup pool - one point behind Connacht - ahead of their final pool fixture away to Zebre on Sunday.
"It has been an incredibly difficult decision to retire from the game at the end of the season, but one that was made easier after I met Uppingham School headmaster Richard Maloney and he shared with me his vision for the school," De Luca told the Wasps website.
Young said: "He is a model professional who has done really well each time he has pulled on the Wasps shirt. He has a great attitude and adds a lot to the squad through his international experience."

Article text: The bosses involved include Oliver Schmidt, who was in charge of VW's US environmental regulatory compliance office from 2012 until March 2015.
He was arrested on Saturday on charges that he took part in a conspiracy to defraud the US and VW customers.
Volkswagen said it could not comment on an "ongoing" legal matter.
A complaint to the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, filed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against VW at the end of last year, accuses the carmaker of deliberately misleading regulators about cheating US pollution tests by means of so-called "defeat devices".
The complaint said Mr Schmidt and others gave a presentation to VW's executive management on or about 27 July 2015.
"In the presentation, VW employees assured VW executive management that US regulators were not aware of the defeat device," the complaint said.
"Rather than advocate for disclosure of the defeat device to US regulators, VW executive management authorised its continued concealment."
Separately, VW owners in the UK are seeking several thousand pounds in compensation over the scandal.
By the summer of 2015, the complaint from the FBI said US regulators knew that emissions from VW diesel vehicles were "substantially higher" when they were being driven on the road than when being tested.
The affidavit said Mr Schmidt - who was the general manager in charge of VW's Environmental and Engineering Office between 2012 and March 2015 - knew the discrepancy was because VW had "intentionally installed software in the diesel vehicles it sold in the US from 2009 through 2015 designed to detect and cheat US emissions tests".
In 2015, Mr Schmidt travelled to the US to talk to US regulators about the discrepancy. The filing says that during these talks, Mr Schmidt "intended to, and did, deceive and mislead US regulators" by saying the difference in the emission levels was not because of deliberate cheating.
The affidavit cites two VW employees who said that in a presentation to VW's executive management in Germany, "VW employees [including Mr Schmidt] assured VW executive management that US regulators were not aware of the defeat devices - that is the engines' ability to distinguish between the dynamometer and road mode.
"Rather than advocate for disclosure of the defeat device to US regulators, VW executive management authorised its continued concealment. "
VW said it would not be "appropriate to comment on any ongoing investigations or to discuss personnel matters".
"Volkswagen continues to cooperate with the Department of Justice as we work to resolve remaining matters in the United States," it said.
Meanwhile, in the UK, lawyers said 10,000 VW owners had already expressed an interest in suing VW. They estimated that owners could get "several thousand" pounds in compensation.
Harcus Sinclair is applying for a group litigation order - which is similar to a US class action lawsuit - in the High Court later this month.
The legal action is aimed at securing compensation for people who own or have previously owned one of the vehicles.
In the UK around 1.2 million diesel engine cars are affected by the emissions scandal.
Harcus Sinclair said it was basing its estimate of the level of compensation owners could get on the â‚¬5,000 (Â£4,300) per owner awarded in Spain and the $8-10,000 awarded in the US.
"The key allegation is that the affected cars should not have been certified as fit for sale because it is alleged that they produced higher levels of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions than the rules allowed," it said in a statement.
Seventy-seven current or former VW owners have put their names to Harcus Sinclair's application for a group litigation order which will be heard in the High Court on 30 January.
The firm hopes that the marketing and publicity surrounding Monday's launch will encourage more drivers to sign up to the action.
It added it was also talking to other law firms about joining forces with them, in an effort to avoid cost duplication.
If the High Court gives the action the go-ahead, a pre-trial hearing will follow and then the trial itself in about 18 months.
In a statement, VW said: "We have been notified that Harcus Sinclair intends to bring proceedings against Volkswagen on behalf of 77 claimants in the English High Court.
"We intend to defend such claims robustly," it added.
Another law firm, Leigh Day, said it had been approached by about 10,000 VW owners regarding the emissions issue.
However, the company said it wanted to avoid the "cost risk associated with pursuing the matter through the courts".
Instead, it had submitted some test cases to the dispute resolution body, the Motor Ombudsman.

Article text: The superb Jonathan Sexton kicked Ireland into a 6-0 lead before Handre Pollard replied before the break.
Rhys Ruddock's try straight after half-time helped increase Ireland's lead to 13-3 before Marcell Coetzee's score cut the margin to three points.
However, two more Sexton penalties and Tommy Bowe's try put the game out of sight before JP Pietersen's late score.
The Springboks went into the game hot favourites after beating New Zealand a month ago but found themselves unable to match Ireland's remarkable resolve.
Ruddock was a late inclusion in the Ireland team after original selection Chris Henry was ruled out by illness.
Ireland had heroes all their pitch with prop Jack McGrath brave in the scrum and at the breakdown but there was no doubting that Sexton was deserving of his man-of-the-match honour.
The Irish fly-half conclusively won his duel with emerging Springboks fly-half Handre Pollard as the home side effectively targeted both South Africa half-backs.
Springboks scrum-half Francois Hougaard endured a nightmare evening as South Africa's backs moves were largely confined to runs from lively full-back Willie le Roux.
Joe Schmidt's players also showed a ruthlessness in the closing 15 minutes after replacement hooker's Adriaan Strauss's sin-binning was followed by Bowe's match-clinching try.
With Sexton orchestrating, the Irish effectively mixed a kicking and running game in the early stages and the fly-half kicked the opening points in the eighth minute after McGrath had out-duelled Jannie du Plessis in a scrum.
Ireland, minus regular hooker Rory Best, struggled in a couple of early line-outs and had an escape in the 13th minute as Hougaard's fumble at the base of a ruck just short of the line allowed McGrath to hack to safety.
Sexton's 24th-minute penalty increased Ireland's lead before the home scrum began to creak for the first time.

South Africa's scrum dominance forced two kickable penalties in three minutes but their decision to chase tries from line-outs backfired on both occasions as the Irish defence held firm.
Pollard finally opened South Africa's account before the break to cut the margin to three and the visitors must have remained confident as they trudged into the dressing-rooms.
However, they were rocked within two minutes of the restart by Ruddock's crucial try.
Young Irish centre Robbie Henshaw's superb kick had forced Le Roux to concede a line-out deep in Springboks territory and Ruddock burst through to score after Devin Toner had soared to win Sean Cronin's throw.
Sexton's conversion increased Ireland's lead to 13-3 but there was still some 36 minutes of action left.
The visitors looked right back in the contest on 57 minutes as Coetzee barged his way over after the option of turning down an easy three points finally bore fruit.
Pollard's conversion cut the margin to three but crucially Ireland doubled their advantage within six minutes as Sexton punished Duane Vermeulen's high tackle on Jamie Heaslip.
Bakkies Botha was introduced width 15 minutes remaining but the South Africans were then handed a hammer blow as replacement hooker Strauss was yellow carded for his high tackle on Rob Kearney.
With their numerical advantage, the Irish produced intense pressure in the 70th minute and it yielded Sexton's fourth penalty of the match as there was to be no repeat of his crucial late miss against the All Blacks 12 months ago.
Ireland's remarkable victory was secured within two minutes as Murray's perfectly weighted chip in behind the defence was grabbed by Bowe before he dived over the line.
The magnificent Sexton landed the conversion before he was hauled ashore and his replacement Ian Madigan then got in on the scoring act with another penalty before an Aviva Stadium attendance that appeared stunned by the magnitude of the home victory.
Pietersen ran in South African's second try in the closing seconds but was it was little consolation for the visitors.

Article text: The lab - which is not being named - is run by UK personnel, not the US military, said Colonel Steve Warren.
"Another lot came up positive and that lot had sent samples to the UK and Massachusetts," the colonel said, referring to the deadly bacteria.
It brings to 68 the number of labs involved in the anthrax scare from the US, including four foreign countries.
A number of US military facilities for the past decade have shipped inactivated anthrax samples to labs around the world to help their research into biological warfare.
But in recent weeks, it has come to light that some suspect samples were not properly de-activated before being posted.
After Tuesday's briefing, Col Warren told the BBC they could not be sure the UK received the live samples but it was sent samples from a larger batch - Lot 5 - in which some of the bacteria was found.
Staff members at some of the labs have been treated for anthrax exposure as a precaution, but no-one has fallen ill.
In addition to labs around the US, suspect samples were sent to facilities in Australia, Canada, South Korea and the UK.
Experts in bio-safety have heavily criticised the lapse and called for improved precautions.
Symptoms of anthrax exposure include skin ulcers, nausea, vomiting and fever, and can cause death if untreated.
The military has ordered all of its labs that have previously received inactive anthrax samples to test them. In addition it is advising all labs to cease working with these samples until told otherwise.
The Pentagon has maintained there is no risk to the general public.
What is anthrax?
Anthrax bacteria live primarily in inactive spores and are found naturally in the soil, but people can ingest or inhale spores, which can make the anthrax active.
Not all will become ill when exposed to anthrax but left untreated, anthrax illness can turn very serious or lead to death.
A blood culture test is used to confirm anthrax exposure.
Anthrax entered the US national consciousness in 2001, when shortly after the 9/11 attacks, letters containing powdered anthrax arrived at news organisations and the offices of US senators. Twenty-two people were affected and of those, five people died.

Article text: People visit the temple throughout the day to pray to the kuman for good fortune, lighting incense sticks and kneeling before the garishly-coloured figures.
Some buy lottery tickets, and run their hands along the trunk of a fallen ironwood tree, festooned with coloured scarves and smoothed by years of handling. They believe they can see the winning number in the faded grain of the wood.
Thais, like many people in South East Asia, are superstitious. But the monks at the temple have found their doll collection growing recently, as people have quietly left behind child-sized figures, known as luk thep, or 'child angels'. The monks have moved them to a small room in a tower, where, like the kuman, they are served the red fizzy drinks they are believed to prefer.
"Each person has their own beliefs", one of the monks, Phra Prasit Warayan told me, "but the belief in the power of luk thep is very strong. When things go well for the owner, they worship them, but when things turn bad, they abandon them. Because they are afraid of what might happen, they leave them here, because they know we accept them, and the abbot is always careful to put them in an appropriate place."
The dolls look incongruous in the temple, in their formal children's clothing and with their wide-eyed, Western features. But how did the luk thep craze start? And is it just a continuation of the kuman belief, that inanimate objects can be inhabited by a ghost, or spirit?
I hoped to find that answer at a dazzling pink house in a gated community in another suburb.
A chubby, blond doll's head sits on a shrine, next to offerings of food and water. Various other limbs lay drying outside after being given a special cream massage. In one room, two young women sat surrounded by different parts of doll's anatomies, carefully applying nail varnish, nose studs and weaving real human hair into soft, plastic scalps. The dolls are often given yantra - Buddhist tattoos - and are filled with rice, a symbol of prosperity.
In the next room Mananya Boonmi lovingly brushes the hair of her favourite doll, Pet. She has collected these dolls for fourteen years, but she did not always see them as she does now, as living beings, who will reward their owners with good fortune - as long as they are looked after as if they are a human child. She believes she was one of the earliest believers in luk thep.
She says she was selling small souvenirs around four years ago, when she had the feeling that one of her dolls, Ploy, was trying to help. She began to treat the doll like a real child, and her business took off. She says she was also able to overcome difficulties she was having raising her son.
"We can rely on luk thep mentally", she says. "They make us happy, as if they are alive, and we can carry them around with us. I love dressing them up, and talking to them. And if you look after them properly, they will come into your dreams."
The luk thep craze really took off last year when a few Thai celebrities were seen carrying their dolls with them everywhere, even to expensive restaurants or on flights. As they saw them as near-human, and felt they needed to treat them well to ensure good fortune, they refused to put the dolls in their check-in luggage or in the overhead compartment. They wanted to buy seats for them.
Last month the airline Thai Smile made headlines by allowing this. But there was a quick change of heart after a consultation with air safety officials. It turns out that the inanimate luk thep are luggage after all, and must be stowed as such. So Mananya says she will no longer fly.
Mananya now sells the dolls to customers for prices that can exceed $1,000. She holds ceremonies to impart a 'soul' into the dolls, but she does not feel this is the same as the spirit inhabiting kuman. Others have taken their dolls to Buddhist monks for blessings.
The belief in kuman thong, to give them their full name, dates back hundreds of years. In the old days, practitioners would try to obtain a real dead foetus, bake it dry, and then lacquer and gild it. It was believed to have very strong magical powers, but needed to be carefully fed and clothed.
There are striking similarities with the pampering some luk thep get, with wealthy owners giving their dolls botox injections or buying them jewellery.
Professor Attachak Sattayanurak from Chiang Mai University sees strong parallels between the two kinds of dolls. He says that in Thailand there was a surge in demand for objects that might bring better luck in the chaos that followed the end of World War Two. Interest in the kuman tradition increased, although it was obviously necessary to find substitutes for a real foetus.
"More than 65% of Thai people work in the informal sector", he says. "Their lives are always uncertain. And recently the whole country has been going through a turbulent period. People are looking for comfort, for protection."
Nine years ago, when Thailand was also under military rule, I witnessed another sudden craze here. This was for an amulet called jatukam, which was first made by a police chief who claimed it had helped him solve difficult cases. Prices for the amulets, which were blessed by one temple in Southern Thailand, soared to astronomical levels.
At one point an image of the amulet was projected onto Thailand's tallest building. People ascribed all manner of powers to them. Then, just as suddenly, they lost interest, prices collapsed, and today they are more or less forgotten.
A similar fate may eventually await the luk thep dolls.

Article text: The plans are part of reforms which would see the House of Commons reduce from 650 MPs to 600. A public consultation is now under way and final proposals will not be made until 2018.
Under the proposals:
England would change from 533 seats to 501, losing 33 constituencies but gaining one when the Isle of Wight is divided into two seats.
Wales would lose 11 of its 40 seats, leaving it with 29. This is the biggest proportional change across the nations and reflects that fact that many of the Welsh constituencies have low numbers of registered voters. It would be the biggest single change to Wales' electoral map since the Boundary Commission was created in 1944.
Scotland, which will announce detailed proposals next month, would change from 59 seats to 53.
Northern Ireland has already unveiled its plans which see its constituencies reduce from 18 to 17.
In England, all but 68 of the current 533 constituencies will see some change with 33 being abolished entirely.
The Isle of Wight will become two constituencies meaning that the net reduction in seats is 32.
Some of the changes are minor with single wards swapping constituency or boundaries simply becoming aligned with local authority divisions.
The North West loses seven constituencies and 14 of the current 75 remain unchanged.
The West Midlands loses six constituencies and seven remain unchanged.
London loses five constituencies - so will end up with 68 rather than 73.  Four constituencies remain unchanged. Jeremy Corbyn's seat Islington North is being divided between two new seats - Finsbury and Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington.
Every single constituency in Wales will change and 11 will disappear under the proposals. Sixteen existing constituencies would be wholly contained within new ones. Full proposals have been published by the Boundary Commission for Wales.
Each constituency in the UK should contain roughly the same number of eligible voters, the so-called "electoral quota" which is reached by dividing the total electorate of the UK by the number of required constituencies.
After excluding the Isle of Wight and two Scottish island constituencies, the quota currently stands at 74,769, based on the electoral register as it stood on 1 December 2015.
This cut-off date has caused some controversy because the switch to individual electoral registration meant that 770,000 names dropped off the list.
However, the Electoral Commission has said that it is unclear how many of those were eligible voters and how many were just people who were no longer eligible through moving house or other reasons.
The list also does not reflect those who registered to vote ahead of the EU referendum in June.
Apart from the Scottish constituencies of Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney & Shetland and Caithness, Sutherland & Easter Ross, all the smallest constituencies are in Wales.
The proposed reforms will see Wales reduced from its current 40 seats to 29 with no constituency left unchanged.
