Article text: The sperm of a proto-facist Italian soldier and poet has been used to reconstruct his DNA, the first time this technique has been used. Scientists performed the reconstruction, which usually requires the exhumation of remains, by analysing a handkerchief belonging to soldier and poet Gabriele D’Annunzio 100 years ago. It had been given by D’Annunzio to his lover, Countess Olga Levi Brunner, in 1916 with semen residue on it. Italian Gabriele D’Annunzio's (shown right, with Mussolini on the left) sperm was use to reconstruct his DNA. Scientists analysed a handkerchief belonging to D’Annunzio 100 years ago. It had been given to his lover Countess Olga Levi Brunner with semen on it . The handkerchief was analysed by police in Cagliari, Sardinia, along with a letter written by the countess and an ivory toothbrush. They had been stored at the Vittoriale degli Italiani foundation in Lombardy, northern Italy. D’Annunzio, born 12 March 1863, moved into the building in 1922 until his death on 1 March 1938. It was later turned into a museum. Scientists believe that DNA evidence found at a crime scene could in the future be used to create mugshots of criminal suspects. This is one potential use to emerge from a new research paper - Modeling 3D Facial Shape From DNA - published on last year in Plos Genetics. In the article, a team of scientists explained how they were able to produce crude 3D models of faces simply from people's DNA samples. ‘We show that facial variation with regard to sex, ancestry, and genes can be systematically studied with our methods, allowing us to lay the foundation for predictive modeling of faces,’ the researchers wrote. Experts studied the artifacts using a crimescope light, which can observe objects in a variety of wavelengths. This revealed the hidden blotches on the handkerchief, the DNA results of which were then compared with Federico d’Annunzio, the right-wing revolutionary’s great grandson. Vittoriale degli Italiani foundation chief Giordano Bruno Guerri joked that the experiment might open the door to the future cloning of historical figures even if their remains have been lost. ‘Nobody wants to clone D’Annunzio, but nobody knows what changes will take place in science and society,’ he said. ‘It’s good the DNA has been collected.’ AFP news agency described D’Annunzio as a ‘proto-fasciast warmonger’, with many saying his ideals were a forerunner to Italian fascism. The Italian Carabinieri Forensic Department (shown) presented results of their research about an unpublished letter that Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) wrote on 15 July 1935. D'Annunzio's DNA has been extracted from a handkerchief stained with sperm that the poet gave a woman as a 'present' after having sex in 1916 . A member of the Italian Carabinieri Forensic Department presents an unpublished letter (left) that Italian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio (1863-1938) wrote on 15 July 1935 to Carabinieri colonel Adelchi Struffi.

Article text: Kelly Jane Richards has been told she could face prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy . A married mother-of-two broke down in tears after she was told she could be sent to prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy. Kelly Jane Richards, of South Wales, admitted having sex with the teenager, who is less than half her age. The Jehovah's Witness was arrested last December after the child's mother discovered what had happened. The 36-year-old had originally denied seducing the teen, but pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child. Richards sat in the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, South Wales, and broke down in tears as the charge was read to her. Two elders from the Jehovah's Witness community were sitting at the back of the court to give her support. The court was told Richards 'did not reasonably believe that he was 16 or over' when she had penetrative sex with the schoolboy just two months before his birthday. The offence took place during term time in 2012, the court heard. A second similar charge was left to 'lie on file'. Sarah Waters, defending, told the court Richards was of 'good character'. Judge Richard Twomlow told Richards she would be sentenced later this month. He added that 'all options remain open' - which includes a custodial sentence. He told her: ' You will be sentenced later this month and I am going to ask for a report so the court knows more about you. 'The fact I am asking for a report and granting bail does not give any indication of the sentence I will pass. 'This is a serious matter. 'Obviously I will reserve the matter to myself and all sentencing options remain open to me.' She was shielded going out of the court by her husband. Richards will be sentenced on March 23. Richards was pictured with a hood covering her head arriving at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court this morning . The married mother of two was said to break down in tears after she appeared at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court .

Article text: Borussia Dortmund had to settle for a point after they were held to a second successive Bundesliga draw at home to Cologne on Saturday. A win would have sent Jurgen Klopp’s side just one point behind ninth placed Werder Bremen, but they were unable to take advantage against a resolute Cologne.

Ilkay Guendogan battles for the ball with Yuya Osako during the  Borussia Dortmund and Cologne game . Dortmund's striker Marco Reus vies for the ball during the match against Cologne . It had looked like it was going to be an action packed Bundesliga battle as Brazilian Deyverson beat the hosts’ defence before failing to capitalise on his chance. Moments later Dortmund had the chance to punish Cologne’s inability to take their chances but failed themselves as defender Neven Subotic headed over. However, that was the end of the action as the visitors installed a deep defensive line as Klopp’s side began to try and probe their opposition. Kevin Kamp of Dortmund battles for the ball with Slawomir Peszko at at Signal Iduna Park . Dortmund's head coach Juergen Klopp reacts during the German first division Bundesliga clash . Dortmund’s inability to break down a stubborn Cologne defence was not helped when Henrikh Mkhitaryan suffered what looked to be a painful injury. He was replaced by Jakub Blaszczykowski on the hour mark and is now a doubt for the Champions League clash with Juventus later this week. Blaszczykowski himself failed to find the key to unlock the Cologne defence and Klopp’s side were forced to settle for a second successive Bundesliga draw.

Article text: Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)Ferguson's police chief and other city officials are already out. Now some residents have told the Missouri city they'll try to oust the mayor, too. Five residents Friday filed an affidavit saying they'll try to force a referendum on whether to remove Mayor James Knowles -- capping a tumultuous week in a community grappling not only with last year's fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown, but also Wednesday's wounding of two police officers shot during a protest. A group supporting the filing, Organization for Black Struggle, a 35-year-old St. Louis-based activist group, said the five would try to collect enough signatures -- 15% of the city's registered voters -- in the next 60 days. The five "initiated recall (attempt) due to Mayor Knowles' failure to adequately rein in an out-of-control police department during the protests following Mike Brown's death," the activist group said. The city government acknowledged Saturday that it received the affidavit. Earlier this week, the police chief and the city manager resigned in the wake of a U.S. Justice Department report alleging institutionalized racism at just about every level of Ferguson's municipal government, including the police department. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including police. The top municipal court clerk was fired earlier in connection with racist emails. This month's Justice Department report was initiated after one of Ferguson's police officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed African-American teen Michael Brown in August, a shooting that spurred months of protests. Wilson, a white officer who said he shot Brown in self-defense, will not be charged in the case -- a grand jury declared it wouldn't indict him in November, and the Justice Department said this month that it would not bring federal civil rights charges in the case. Wilson resigned from the department in November, citing security concerns. Knowles indicated Friday he won't be stepping down. "I think it's important to recognize that there's a lot of people who may be angry at the situation; there's a lot of people who are frustrated in this community with the way things have gone down," the mayor, who is white, told CNN. "But there's a lot of people who still -- and who have expressed this to me -- express confidence in both my willingness, and members of the (City) Council's willingness, to listen, to be responsive, and to make changes as necessary," he continued. "People in the community recognize this, now, not everybody. I didn't win every time with 100% of the vote. But I can tell you there are ways to remove me if that is the will of the people," the mayor said. Blake Ashby, a white resident of Ferguson, said Friday that he believed Knowles has "consciously tried to reach out to all parts" of the city of 21,000 people. "If we lose Mayor Knowles, we lose a force for change, and it will be harder to make the changes that the DOJ (Department of Justice) is asking for," Ashby said. Rasheen Aldridge, a black member of a commission charged with recommending reforms in Ferguson, said  that Knowles needed to resign in the wake of the DOJ report. "He knew what was going on during his watch," said Aldridge, a member of the Ferguson Commission, which Gov. Jay Nixon formed last year. Investigators still are seeking breaks in the case of two police officers who were shot Wednesday night during a protest in Ferguson. While the demonstrators' focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works for that police department. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, police said. The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back. He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both were treated and released. "I cannot tell you an arrest is imminent, and there's certainly no one in custody," St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters Friday afternoon. "The detectives are working this investigation around the clock, and they will not rest until we have a conclusion in this investigation," the chief said. Police have "several leads," he said. "I think we have a pretty good general idea of where we think the shots came from." Sara Sidner reported from Ferguson, Missouri. Jason Hanna reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Ed Payne and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.

Article text: Dull train journeys have become a thing of the past in one Chinese city where  carriages have been decorated with intricate 3D designs for a very unusual reason. The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was actually advertising sanitary towels, according to The People's Daily Online. Photographs of the beautifully decorated carriages were shared widely on social media and the PR stunt, which coincided with International Women's Day, won praise from commuters. PR stunt: The stunning art in the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line in the city of Hangzhou in east China's Zhejiang Province was part of an advertising campaign . Rainforest: One of the carriages on the Hangzhou Subway line has been made to look like a rainforest with green designs on the floor, walls and ceiling . Psychedelic: Each of the carriages contained different images, ranging from traditional blossom trees to more psychedelic designs . Tao Chin, a spokesman for the underground line, said: 'We wanted to make the experience of travelling on carriages more enjoyable, and so the 3D effect covering various subjects was introduced with a good reaction from our customers. 'We make sure that the decorations cover not just the walls but also the windows, doors and roofs to maximise the effect.' There were five different themes used, including an amusement park, European castles and a fairy tale world. Passenger Sying Tsao told local media: 'I didn't see them advertising things and then suddenly when I turned up for work one morning I saw that the carriages had this great new 3D designs. 'They were very realistic, I saw one child nervous about stepping on a 3D floor. 'I have seen three or four different designs, I like the cherry blossom best because I haven't seen any so far this year, and it was really nice and calming, not just for me but for everyone on the tube I think.' Mr Li, manager at the care products company's head office, said using 3D adverts in the carriages not only promoted their products, it also encouraged the 'heads-down generation' to look up and enjoy the scenes around them. But while the colourful designs were appreciated by commuters, most had not realised the carriages were actually advertising sanitary towels. Some took to online message boards to express their shock that they had been surrounded by such adverts.

Article text: Auchareeya Pruankaewmanee is accused of laundering £1m through her bank account, stolen by Barclays Bank fraudster John Skermer . A Thai call girl laundered £1million stolen from a worker at Barclays Bank after they met through an escort agency, a court heard. Auchareeya Pruankaewmanee, 43, is accused of accepting £996,999 from convicted fraudster John Skermer, of Widnes, Cheshire, who set up ‘ghost bank accounts’ to steal from his employer. Skermer has previously confessed to being responsible for a £2.1m fraud after writing computer programmes to exploit inadequacies in Barclays’ system, the Old Bailey heard. Pruankaewmanee is accused of meeting Skermer through Oriental Angels, an escort agency she worked for in London, and transferring the stolen cash to different accounts. It is claimed she received almost £1million from Skermer and transferred £951,728 to her TSB bank account. She then allegedly returned £565,988 to Skermer, who was responsible for 30 million retail bank accounts. John Evison, prosecuting, said: ‘The prosecution say that Ms Pruankaewmanee was working as an escort for an agency called Oriental Angels when she met Mr Skermer and that is how she was introduced to him. ‘She was not the only escort he had seen because as you will hear there were many escorts who received the bank’s money. ‘Mr Skermer also spent money entertaining his friends royally on golfing weekends, buying his wife a present - he was married with children - and helping friends with, not his money, but the bank’s money.’ Pruankaewmanee regularly travelled from her home in Canary Wharf to Cheshire to see Skermer, the court heard. ‘She became a money launderer because he wanted to get the money from Barclays Bank into another account and Ms Pruankaewmanee was the person who, the Crown say, facilitated that,’ the prosecutor added. Pruankaewmanee was arrested last June when her name came to light during the course of the investigation. She admits receiving the money and making the transfers, but claims she believed Skermer was a rich businessman with several legitimate businesses in the UK and abroad. Mr Evison said: ‘She accepts she met him as an escort and he was very generous. She says their relationship developed and she believed she was in a loving relationship with a wealthy man and she says she fell in love with him.’ Pruankaewmanee (left) accepts she met convicted fraudster John Skermer (right) when working as an escort for Oriental Angels but claims she never knew or suspected the £1million he gave her was criminal property . Pruankaewmanee claims she was ‘naive and vulnerable’, but never knew or suspected the money was criminal property. ‘The Crown say her account is not a credible one. She knew, the Crown say, this money was the proceeds of criminal activity or if she didn’t initially have that knowledge she must have suspected that was the case,’ Mr Evison added. Skermer, from Widnes, Cheshire, admitted carrying the £2.1million fraud last March, the Old Bailey heard. The software manager, now 46, spent the money on escorts, ‘royally’ entertaining his friends on golfing weekends and gifts for his wife, jurors were told. Pruankaewmanee denies acquiring criminal property, entering into a money laundering relationship and transferring criminal property between 22 December 2011 and 19 February 2013. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Article text: A small girl kneeling on the floor of an old mental asylum ward, the shadowy figure of a prison guard standing near a cell and a man lurking in the corner of a hotel basement. These are the spine-tingling images that have emerged from some of Australia's most haunted destinations. Together, medium Rayleen Kable and ghost hunter Allen Tiller have travelled around Australia visiting these sites on a mission to prove the existence of supernatural beings – and to help ghosts stuck in limbo 'move onto the afterlife'. Scroll down for video . Ghost hunters capture what they believe is the spirit of a girl in the Grevillia wing, Beechworth Lunatic Asylum . The cast of TV show Haunting: Australia said that while on tour earlier this year a guest captured this image of what he thought was a male ghost in the basement of the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia . And while most people may be sceptical that they are finding real evidence of the supernatural Tiller says that's precisely why he does it. In January this year, Kable and Tiller led a group on a tour around Australia collecting photographs, electromagnetic readings and sound recordings of what they believe are the spirits of figures from decades past. The pair make up the local contingent of the cast of TV show Haunting: Australia, which is currently being replayed on 4METV and is due to premier on SYFY in the U.S. later this month. While filming their eight-part series they visited some of Australia's most notorious haunted sites, but they say one of the spookiest visits they ever made was to Beechworth Lunatic Asylum in north-east Victoria in January this year. A member of their tour group captured a haunting image of what appears to be a small girl kneeling on the floor in the darkness of the most notorious wing of the old mental asylum. Haunting: Australia cast member Gaurav Tiwari captured an image of what he believes to be a prison guard standing near the stairs at Geelong Gaol in Victoria . Ghost hunter Allen Tiller (left) and medium Rayleen Kable (right) travelled around Australia visiting haunted sites on a mission to prove the existence of supernatural beings . They say one of the spookiest visits they ever made was to Beechworth Lunatic Asylum (pictured) in north-east Victoria in January this year . The ghost hunters collect photographs, electromagnetic readings and sound recordings of what they believe are spirits . The Grevillia wing of Beechworth was where patients were given electric shock treatments and kept in strait jackets at the institution, which was operational between 1867 and 1995. Visitors to the wing have often reported sightings of the ghost of a male doctor and also of a female matron. But Tiller said some of the female patients of Beechworth had children with them – providing an explanation as to what he believes is captured in the photograph. Tiller said he also had his own personal haunting experience while at Beechworth, in a section of the asylum known as the 'bull pen'. 'It used to house aggressive youths from 18 to 25, and in there I heard a door slamming, and I audibly hear footsteps go up the hallway,' he said. 'Then we had clear EVPs [electronic voice phenomena] of a couple of people say 'Get out.' Tiller – who says he is not a psychic or medium - uses a whole range of gadgets including full spectrum cameras, electromagnetic field detectors and voice recorders to gather 'evidence' of the spirit world. Kable - who is both a psychic and a medium – said her experience at Beechworth was 'amazing'. 'It's definitely got activity and lots of it,' she said. For Kable, the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia . A disgruntled male spirit tried to attach itself to her in the 'Hallway of Hell' (pictured) For Tiller the most interesting experience was catching what he believes is evidence of the spirit of a young girl called 'Sarah'. The hotel once served as a brothel, and legend has it that when a prostitute was murdered inside the hotel her young daughter 'Sarah' was taken in by the hotel's madam . 'We got some really Class A 'EVPs'– and basically what that is is a recording of a spirit so you actually hear it on a recorder. 'I actually got this disgruntled spirit that said my name clearly… you just hear this spirit screaming down my recorder.' For Kable, the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia when a disgruntled male spirit tried to attach itself to her in the 'Hallway of Hell'. 'It was definitely a male spirit, but I wouldn't say a happy male spirit,' she said. Tiller said he and other tour guests had their own encounters with ghosts while at Kapunda. One guest captured an image of what he believes is a man standing the corner of the hotel's basement. For Tiller the most interesting experience was catching what he believes is evidence of the spirit of a young girl called 'Sarah'. The hotel once served as a brothel, and legend has it that when a prostitute was murdered inside the hotel her young daughter 'Sarah' was taken in by the hotel's madam. 'I was closing up the top of hotel after a tour and I saw a little girl standing in hallway,' he said. 'She ran down the hall to take her out of the hotel and she looked solid… she was laughing. Tiller said he had another haunting experience while at Geelong Gaol in Victoria . He was in a section upstairs on the third level when he says he heard a 'low whispery growl' 'She's been seen multiple times. 'You can say "Are you here Sarah?" and she'll light up different devices.' Tiller said he had another haunting experience while at Geelong Gaol in Victoria. 'I was in a section upstairs on the third level and I had a psychic tell me there was something evil in the corner,' he said. 'While I was waiting I actually heard a low whispery growl in there, and there was no way an animal could get in there. 'That was pretty spooky.' At the same site fellow Haunting: Australia cast member Gaurav Tiwari captured an image of what he believes to be a prison guard standing near the stairs. The image appears red and purple because it is taken with a full spectrum camera – a favourite among ghost hunters who say it is like a video camera that has filters removed meaning it shows light spectrums the human eye can't see. Kable says she does the work she does in order to help spirits that are 'stuck'. Kable - a medium - says she does the work she does in order to help spirits that are 'stuck'. Pictured is Geelong Gaol . Tiller accepts that people may be sceptical of the existence of ghosts and supernatural beings, but that doesn't stop him trying to prove they're out there . The cast of TV show Haunting: Australia, which is currently being replayed on 4METV and is due to premier on SYFY in the U.S. later this month . 'For me as a medium my objective is if that spirit needs help and wants to move on, I help them,' she said. 'If they don't want to move on my second objective would be to give validation to the spirit world. 'For anybody who's a witness and anybody in that location that really does want to believe and understand the afterlife, that there is a way for them to communicate from whatever realm they're in to our realm.' Tiller accepts that people may be sceptical of the existence of ghosts and supernatural beings, but that doesn't stop him trying to prove they're out there. 'I'm there to record anything that might come up, with the outcome being hopefully that we can prove life after death,' he said. 'A lot of people think dying is the end. 'But if people knew there was a possibility that we move on, stress levels would drop off and people would have peace of mind.' Haunting: Australia airs on 4METV on Mondays at 10pm .

Article text: David Villa has graced the grandest stages of them all. World Cup and Champions League triumphs sit proudly on a superb CV. His spell at New York City FC may not be on the same level, yet the unbridled joy displayed at creating history with the new Major League Soccer side’s first ever goal on the hallowed turf of Yankee Stadium was there for all to see. It was his presence which attracted a healthy and encouraging 43,507 here. And  it was his typically busy display which ultimately was the difference. David Villa fires past Bobby Shuttleworth to score the first goal for New York City FC at Yankee Stadium . The Spaniard finished off a neatly-worked move with Ned Grabavoy to put the hosts on the way to a well-deserved victory . Yankee Stadium played host to a whole new ball game as the MLS expansion franchise won its first game in the Big Apple . A packed Yankee Stadium watches as the two teams battle it out in the second game of the MLS season . New York City: Saunders; Williams (Facey 79), Hernandez, Wingert, Brovsky; Velasquez (Shelton 66), Diskerud, Jacobsen, Grabavoy; Villa, Nemec (Mullins 84). Booked: Wingert, Williams . Goals: Villa 19, Mullins 84 . New England Revolution: Shuttleworth; Alston (Barnes 59), Farrell, Goncalves, Tierney; Kobayashi, Dorman; Rowe, Nguyen (Caldwell 71), Fagundez; Agueldo (Davies 65). Booked: Agueldo, Dorman . Sent off: Goncalves . Attendance: 43,507 . His first goal since moving to the US this summer was a clinically taken strike on 20 minutes and, on another day and without the seemingly impenetrable Bobby Shuttleworth standing in his way, the 33 year-old would have bagged a hatful. Yet he still managed to retain his composure and cross for Patrick Mullins on 84 minutes to nab the killer second and prove the former Barcelona and Atletico Madrid striker brings much more to the table than just lightning quick reactions in front of goal. Of course, it's not all about one man and, in truth, Manchester City’s newest fledgling entity were decent value after securing their first win against a New England Revolution side who were harshly forced to play with 10 for the last 23 minutes following Jose Goncalves’ straight red card. City have aggressively marketed their brand new adventure in Manhattan, hammering home the fact that they – and not the New Jersey based Red Bulls – are the true team of New York. The numbers swilling around outside before kick-off suggested it had done the trick. Yankee stadium, no matter how resplendent an arena it is, will never be a perfect fit for the beautiful game. Yet NYCFC and their freshly conceived, enthusiastic fanbase did their best to make it feel like home. The makeshift pitch which has already got the baseball players fretting ahead of their season opener in three weeks time, was certainly passable. There was a decent atmosphere though here in the Bronx. The rarest of sightings in this vast country - away fans - played their part too. It was hard to gauge exactly at what stage Jason Kreis’ side were at in the opening day draw with fellow newcomers Orlando City. They are still in an embryonic stage after just a handful of games together. New York City FC celebrate after Patrick Mullins wrapped up the first victory of the MLS season for the team .

New York City FC fans wait for the start of the game during the inaugural game of the MLS franchise . New England, who were denied the title last season by Robbie Keane’s LA Galaxy, would certainly provide a much clearer yardstick. And so it proved. Villa buzzed around early on, teeing up frontman Adam Nemec who shot straight at Revolution keeper Bobby Shuttleworth before the Spanish was ace was denied on 15 minutes following a typical jinking run into the box. The former Barcelona man was, by far and away, the most potent player on the pitch. And on 19 minutes came his first MLS strike. It was a classic Villa moment. A sweet exchange with Ned Grabavoy opened up the visitor’s backline and as Villa bore down on goal, there was only going to be one outcome. His finish was assured, calm and clinical. When Frank Lampard arrives in the summer, the added quality will ensure City will be hugely competitive. Yet in the land of single entity leagues and the desperation of ensuring level playing fields, weaknesses in other parts of the pitch are harder to plug. The home side’s defence looked particularly creaky with New England knocking on the door with increasing regularity following Villa’s opener. The best chances fell to Juan Agudelo, the first on 36 minutes when a weak flick dribbled the wrong side of the post before he somehow headed straight at Josh Saunders from four yards out.

Fans wait to enter Yankee Stadium for the MLS match between the two teams in the first home game for New York City FC . Three minutes after the re-start , the game should have been dead and buried. Twice Villa was set free, twice he failed to apply the finishing touch. It was fast becoming the Shuttleworth and Villa show - the Revolution keeper brilliantly tipping over a fierce 12 yard volley from the Spanish superstar. The visitors were soon reduced to ten men on 67 minutes after centre-half Jose Goncalves was handed a straight red for hauling down substitute Khiry Shelton. Yes, he was the last man. Yet contact was minimal if that. It was left to that man Villa though to have the final say when he crossed for Mullins to make it two. Villa has wasted no time in making an impact. He is already the big man in the Big Apple.

Ground truth Summary: Villa finished a lovely move in the 19th minute, slotting past keeper Bobby Shuttleworth .
The Spaniard played a neat one-two with Ned Grabavoy to score the franchise's first goal in Yankee Stadium .

She said: 'He was kind, gentle, funny and so considerate. He had hundreds of friends in London, which we’ve called home since 2007. 'We have been on lots of adventures together overseas and had many more planned. 'Nick was a journalist and press officer. He was passionate about writing and was so intelligent.

Camden concert venue The Black Heart added to its Facebook page: 'The hardcore scene upstairs just took its biggest supporter back. RIP Nick Mann. The London music scene thanks you.'

Hours before the tragedy – just after midnight on Saturday night – Nick took a selfie with his brother after watching Shrewsbury Town beat Portsmouth in a League Two game. Shrewsbury Town FC said in a statement: 'The football club was saddened to hear the tragic news that lifelong supporter Nick Mann was killed early on Sunday morning in London. 'Nick followed Shrewsbury Town home and away even though he was based in London. His passions were football and music and he was much loved by everyone who met him. 'He had made the trip down to Portsmouth on Saturday and tweeted after the match that it had been one of his favourite away days of the season. 'Social media has been full of tributes to Nick from fellow Town fans and from supporters far and wide.' A picture of Nick will be shown on the scoreboard during Shrewsbury’s home game with Dagenham & Redbridge on Good Friday. Friends yesterday paid tribute to former Manchester University student Nick, who they said 'would have done anything for anyone'. One friend, who did not want to be named, told the Evening Standard: 'The fact that Nick passed away while saving his brother is the least surprising thing in all of this. Emergency services: The scene outside Old Street station in central London after the incident  on Sunday . Ambulance on the scene: Police  said that on arrival officers discovered two men with serious injuries . 'He had all the time in the world for anyone, and gave so much to everything he had passion for. He loved two things in equal measure – music and football. He was one of the most passionate people I've ever known. He was a great dude.' Josh Retallick, who had known Nick for eight years, said: 'It was such a heroic act. I just hope his brother recovers.' Eyewitnesses said the pair were hit by a train as Nick desperately tried to pull his younger brother, who studied history at Manchester Metropolitan University, on to the platform. A Tube worker said: 'The man dropped something down on to the track, a mobile phone or something, and then somehow he's got into trouble down there. 'This other person then tried to help him out and pull him up back on to the platform in time before the train came, but it wasn't in time and they both got hit. It was pretty bad.' Another said: 'It happened at the back of the platform, just as the train pulls in, so maybe they didn't realise how close the train was.' British Transport Police described the incident as a 'tragic accident'. Location: Both men were hit at Old Street station (under this roundabout), and Nick Mann died in hospital .

Article text: English football agents are to take legal action against the FA unless a compromise can be reached over the introduction of ‘unworkable’ new regulations next month. The Association of Football Agents agreed unanimously this week to injunct the FA to prevent them from bringing in ‘unacceptable’ rules from April 1 - after FIFA washed their hands of responsibility for managing the middle men, passing the buck to the national associations. The AFA have engaged the QC and sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner - with the threat of an injunction hovering over a summit with the FA called to resolve the issue. The AFA have engaged the QC and sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner over new FA rules . The agents object to the way the FA intend to administer their lucrative work. This includes a reduction in fees, no pay for representing players under 18 and a free-for-all with no agent’s licence required in future. Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA, said: ‘There is no doubt that the upcoming regulations are unworkable and it will be an horrendous mess unless some agreement can be reached. At least finalising a meeting is some kind of progress.’ The FA, who are understood to have chosen the successor to general secretary Alex Horne, were certainly aiming high with their original wish list. It is understood to have included Formula One Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who is said to have been asked whether he was interested in leaving his £6million-a-year job in motor racing to earn 10 times less at Wembley. You can imagine his quick answer. It is understood Red Bull principal Christian Horner was asked to succeed FA general secretary Alex Horne . Former British No 1 tennis player Buster Mottram, better known for his extreme right-wing political views, has been barred from membership of the All England Club for six weeks. Mottram, 59, who plays regular social tennis at Wimbledon when not involved in games of bridge, refused to comment on the reasons for his suspension. The secretive club, who don’t like talking about their internal business even when staging the Wimbledon Championships, also refused to discuss his misdemeanour. Buster Mottram, pictured in 1955, has been barred from membership of the All England Club for six weeks . The Welsh FA have expressed anger with the FA over their plans to field Team GB football teams at the Rio Olympics without consultation. Welsh FA president Trevor Lloyd-Hughes said he was ‘livid and absolutely gutted with the English FA’, while Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford wants to be involved in all decision-making around 2016, having been given the impression that participation in the 2012 London Games was going to be a one-off. The FA say they have asked the three other home nations where they stand. The Welsh FA were under the impression a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympics was a one-off . DYKE COACHING ROW . There is a major split developing within the FA over chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission proposals to fund coaching development at the expense of cuts across the board. Dyke’s initiative, with £2.7million per year being switched from other parts of the FA budget to pay for 35 new coach educators to work in the grassroots (24) and professional game (11), has been approved by the FA board. But amateur blazers have yet to be convinced about the merits of such expenditure and the resulting 15 per cent cuts being imposed on every department to raise the cash. National game chairman Roger Burden has written to councillors to inform them of their colleagues’ concern about the lack of consultation and their fears that the proposed reduction in FA Trophy and FA Vase prize-money may have a ‘devastating effect’ on some smaller clubs who rely on this money to stay afloat. An FA spokesman said the national game had four representatives on the FA board that has approved the proposal and it was up to individual departments where they made cuts. There are major splits developing within the FA over Greg Dyke's proposal to make cuts . England cricket chiefs Paul Downton and Peter Moores, having presided over abject preparation, performances and team selection at the World Cup, are fortunate the new ECB hierarchy had such low expectations. The high command are also busy with restructuring the organisation, so axeing the team leadership pair is not on their agenda. This probably means Downton and Moores will have this summer’s Ashes series to secure their jobs.

Article text: Angela Swann is still suffering illness now, a year after contracting illness on a dream holiday . A woman who fell seriously ill on a £13,500 trip of a lifetime to Africa is still taking medication a year later. Just days after arriving in Zanibar, Africa, Angela Swann and Andrew Smith say they were infected with gastric illnesses, which they say ruined their longed-for break. The pair were confined to their rooms for three days when they suffered diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea during the week-long, all inclusive stay at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa in March last year. And today, as the pair instruct expert lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to look into their case, they have told how their holiday was ruined. Angela, a nurse from Gosforth, Newcastle, said: 'We just couldn't keep anything down. 'We just thought it was a 24-hour bug. 'But as soon as we were eating we had to go back to the villa. We were just very ill and weak. 'It totally ruined the holiday of a lifetime. 'We both came back suffering from really bad symptoms and it's left us with an illness we have never had before.' The holiday was part of a two-week Under The Serengeti Skies tour arranged through Kuoni, which began on March 15 last year. Both Angela and Andrew, a service manager for Mercedes Benz, took antibiotics which they had taken on holiday with them as a precautionary measure and, following their return to the UK, they also sought treatment. Angela saw a private medical specialist and also had blood tests taken and an ultrasound scan due to the severity of her illness problems. And now - nearly a year on - she says she still feels ill. She added: 'This was supposed to be a holiday of a lifetime which we would treasure forever, but sadly when we look back now we only think of the turmoil we've been through. 'I was not happy about some of the food served as on occasions it was undercooked and I had to send it back. A £13,500 holiday of a lifetime turned into a living hell for  Angela Swann and Andrew Smith who say they were infected with gastric illnesses . A holiday to Zanzibar that should have left a couple with lovely memories, has instead left them in turmoil . 'Also sometimes some of the food served did not appear fresh and some of the food on occasions did not appear hot enough. 'Following falling ill, our holiday was ruined and was utterly embarrassing to say the least. 'Now, we just want answers as to why we fell ill, so that we can begin-to move on from what we've been through.' Nichola Blackburn, the legal expert in Irwin Mitchell's International Personal Injury Law team who is representing Angela and Andrew, said: 'We are conducting investigations into what was the cause of the illness Angela and Andrew suffered from. The couple's week stay at the all-inclusive stay at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa turned sour after the pair fell ill . 'As we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the Hideaway of Nungwi Resort and Spa and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible. 'Sadly, their story of working and saving to afford a luxury break only for the holiday to be ruined by serious illness is an unfortunate one, and understandably such issues have left Angela and Andrew frustrated and desperate for answers regarding the illness they have suffered. 'Kuoni have denied liability and we are seeking to establish what caused them to fall ill.' A Kuoni spokeswoman said: 'Kuoni take any claims surrounding the health and well-being of our customers very seriously indeed. We are aware of this case, which is currently with our legal team and continues to be under investigation so it would be inappropriate to comment further on this particular incident at this stage.'

Article text: Smiles have been hard to come by among the Real Madrid camp of late but as preparations ramped up for their El Clasico date with Barcelona the mood was decidedly buoyant. Under-fire Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo were in full swing during hurdling drills and five-a-side games at the club's Valdebebas training ground on Thursday. Perhaps the air of positivity stems from numbers that suggest despite their recent run of poor form, which has included a 4-3 defeat by Schalke as they scraped through to the Champions League quarter-finals and falling from the top of La Liga, a trip to the Nou Camp could be just what the doctor ordered. Real Madrid's Gareth Bale shows his flexibility at training on Thursday ahead of El Clasico on Sunday . Bale hurdles keeper Iker Casillas and passes with purpose during a spirited session at Valdebebas . Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) pierces team-mates Asier Illarramendi (left) and Alvaro Arbeloa . The facts are that, despite being in the rare position of being underdogs at the weekend, away from home Ronaldo and Bale are Spanish club football's most dangerous forward duo. The Portuguese Ballon d'Or winner and the Welsh winger have more away goals than any other strike partnership, even Lionel Messi and Neymar. Their combined 22 goals in 14 games when not braving the white handkerchiefs of their Bernabeu is leads Messi and Neymar's tally of 18 outside the Nou Camp. Ronaldo has 15 of those and will be keen to catch the Messi, the prodigious Argentine who has been on fire in 2015 with 20 goals in 17 matches in all competition and overtook the Portuguese to be La Liga's top goal scorer. Stats by Squawka . Ronaldo smiles during training ahead of Real's clash with Barcelona on Sunday . Bale has his eyes on the ball and is focussed on a strong performance at the Nou Camp this weekend . Bale, who broke a nine-match goal drought with a double at home in their 2-0 win over Levante, will also be keen to work his way back into favour with Real fans and the Spanish press, who have recently labelled him 'lazy' and a 'ball hog'. Ahead of their trip to Barcelona for Sunday's 9pm kick-off, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti enlisted second division Castilla players Martin Odegaard, the Norwegian wunderkid, and Ruben Yanez to make up the numbers. With Bale and Ronaldo in full flight, only Sami Khedira was missing through a stomach illness while James Rodriguez's foot injury is still on the mend.

Article text: Authorities are investigating a riot at a juvenile rehabilitation camp in rural western Nevada where two buildings were set on fire, four staff members hurt and 10 youths briefly escaped before they were recaptured over the weekend. No one was seriously injured, but one staff member at the Rite of Passage Silver State Academy near Yerington had to be treated at a local hospital after Saturday night's incident, Lyon County Sheriff Al McNeil said Tuesday. The state fire marshal is investigating the arsons, and Yerington Tribal Police are probing the cause of the riot — the fourth uprising in four months at the school for at-risk teens, McNeil said. The camp is on tribal land about 8 miles north of Yerington and 70 miles southeast of Reno. Out-of-control: Authorities are investigating a riot at a juvenile rehabilitation camp in northern Nevada where two buildings were set on fire, four staff members hurt and 10 youths briefly escaped before they were recaptured over the weekend . Destruction: The riot at the Rite of Passage Silver State Academy in rural Nevada at the weekend is the fourth uprising in four months at the school for at-risk teens. The 10 escapees have been recaptured . Six of the escapees were captured shortly after the riot that broke out about 8 p.m. Saturday, and the other four the next morning, he said. One building housing the laundry and another with a maintenance shop suffered an undetermined amount of fire damage. McNeil said he's increasingly concerned about the safety of the community and is pressing officials at the school to make changes so it doesn't happen again. 'I've had public safety concerns over the years because there is no fencing to keep them on the property,' McNeil told The Associated Press. 'They break into my citizens' homes and steal keys and steal cars. My community is at its wit's end right now.' 'This is rural Nevada, and every home has a gun. My biggest concern is one of these kids will go into a house at 2 a.m., and there will be a farmer or a rancher there — and we'll have a fatal shooting. In Nevada, that would be a justifiable homicide, but nobody wants to see that. 'We're all supportive of the program and want to see it succeed. But we need to find a way to do it better.' Investigation: No one was seriously injured, but one staff member at the Rite of Passage Silver State Academy had to be treated at a local hospital after the incident, said Lyon County Sheriff Al McNeil (pictured) The academy is a nonprofit, licensed and accredited charter school operated by the Rite of Passage Adolescent Treatment Centers and Schools, which is based in Minden, Nevada, and sponsored by California's El Dorado County Office of Education. Rick Wright, corporate human resources director for Rite of Passage, said he couldn't comment on details or the status of the youths who were involved because of confidentiality requirements regarding juveniles. 'We had an unpredictable situation,' Wright told the AP. 'We are studying the events of what happened so we can prevent them in the future.' 'We were well staffed up, but we've upped the staffing as a preventative measure,' he said Tuesday afternoon from Minden about 40 miles south of Reno. 'Operations have gone back to normal. Everything was back to normal by Sunday.' The school is required to have one staff member on site for every eight youths, 'and we were well in excess of that — approximately 3-to-1,' Wright said. He estimated that there were about 25 youths at the school at the time. He said he couldn't comment on what sparked the uprising. 'I'm not at liberty to say. It's still under investigation,' Wright said. Scene: A riot at the Rite of Passage facility in Yerington Saturday night resulted in two structure fires and 10 at-risk youth temporarily escaping . Officials for the El Dorado County Office of Education in Placerville, California, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. John Dibble, chairman of the school's advisory board, said school officials are considering changes to improve safety at the facility that opened in 1987. 'I'm devastated that once again we were a threat to the community, and that's not something we enjoy being,' he told KOLO-TV in Reno. The school's website said it provides counseling, educational, vocational and athletic programs for boys ages 14 to 17 'with a troubled past.' The majority are sent there on court orders as an alternative to prison. Rehab: The school's website said it provides counseling, educational, vocational and athletic programs for boys ages 14 to 17 'with a troubled past.' The majority are sent there on court orders as a prison alternative . According to a statement from school administrators, around 8pm Saturday, students started rioting . 'We are disappointed with the actions of a few of our students, and those responsible will be held accountable,' the school said in a statement on its website. 'We are still positive that our program benefits disadvantaged youth and will be evaluating future admissions.' Most of the youths are sent there from neighboring California, McNeil said. Yerington Tribal Police did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. McNeil said several youths 'made a bunch of improvised weapons,' but he had no further details about the incident or nature of the minor injuries.

Article text: Nick Clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories . Nick Clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories. The Lib Dem leader said prosecutors were ‘relying on 13th century laws’ to put reporters on trial and condemned the lack of a defence for those ‘uncovering information in the interests of the public’. He is the most senior political figure to raise concerns about the multi-million pound police investigation into tabloid newspaper payments for information, which critics condemn as a ‘witch hunt’. Operation Elveden, which began in 2011 and has cost taxpayers more than £15million, has seen dawn raids, large numbers of arrests and lengthy bail periods for suspects. But of the 20 journalists whose cases have come before the courts only two have been convicted, and last week one of those, a Sun journalist, was invited to lodge an appeal against his conviction. The rejection of cases by a succession of juries has led to MPs calling for the police and the CPS to look again at the remaining cases. Prosecutors have pursued the newspaper journalists and public sector workers using the ancient common law offence of misconduct in public office. But accused reporters have argued they are pursuing stories which were in the public interest. Speaking at his party’s campaign launch in Abingdon, Oxford, Mr Clegg told the Daily Mail the public interest defence was ‘just far too opaque in too many of our laws. He also called for a ‘proper review and proper reform’ of the misconduct law. He said: ‘I have long been concerned that the laws of the land are not clear enough on the public interest defence for journalists and other people who are covering information in the interests of the public.’ He added: ‘It’s just far too opaque, in too many of our laws, exactly what is the strength and nature of a public interest defence. ‘I would like to see that clarified in law, my party has always advocated that. He added: ‘The fact that prosecutors are relying on 13th century laws, that we don’t have an up-to-date definition of what a public interest defence is, shows the need for a proper review and a proper reform of the law in this area.’ Ten days ago, four Sun journalists were cleared at the Old Bailey of making illegal payments for stories. A former soldier and his wife were also cleared of the misconduct charge after they were accused of leaking the information. Free: Four Sun journalists were cleared at the Old Bailey of making illegal payments for stories . On Friday, the first journalist to be convicted of paying a public official as part of the Elveden probe had her conviction quashed. The former News of the World reporter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was handed a six-month suspended sentence after being found guilty of paying a prison officer for information at the Old Bailey last November. In turn, the officer was jailed for three-and-a-half years for misconduct in a public office and his friend was given 30 weeks behind bars. All three, who cannot be named for legal reasons, launched an appeal and the Lord Chief Justice ruled that their convictions should be quashed. He found the trial judge Charles Wide had ‘misdirected’ the jury on a key aspect of the misconduct in a public office offence relating to the seriousness threshold required for conviction. In his ruling, Lord Thomas Of Cwmgiedd also said that in a democratic society the media played an important role ‘in making information available to the public when it is in the public interest to do so’.

Article text: A heroin dealer has boasted of his soft life in jail with an illegal selfie shot and photos of his cell – complete with cigars, a TV and two games consoles. Jason Crocker, 36, is thought to have uploaded the images online after taking them with a prohibited mobile phone smuggled in to prison. One shot shows a cell door wedged shut from within with a broom handle, and others show toiletries, DVDs and family photos, plus newspaper headlines about him. Jason Crocker, 36, was jailed for five years but has been taking the selfies in his cell showing his cushy life . The headline 'Heroin Kingpin Put Behind Bars', appears in pride of place, stuck on his cell his wall . It is a crime to use a phone in prison and those caught can face having up to two years added to their sentence. Crocker was jailed for five years in December 2013 for supplying heroin from his Plymouth flat. Last year he admitted having a BlackBerry mobile phone in prison and was given a further six-week sentence for using Skype and dating websites from jail. The photos appear to show two different cells used by Crocker, one with grey tiling with a calendar dated October 2014 and one with blue tiling, suggesting he has been moved at some stage and took his phone with him. A home entertainment system in his cell: Crocker keeps a collection of DVDs, games and consoles . Left: The convicted drug dealer keeps an article saying 'Good Riddance' on his wall. Right: The self-proclaimed kingpin takes pictures of his mates and posts it on Facebook, against prison regulations . His Facebook page, which is hidden to anyone who is not his friend on the site, also shows pictures of his fellow convicts. Commenting on the photos online, family members laughed off Crocker’s antics. On Facebook, Kayleigh Crocker posted: ‘Go on dad hahahaha.’ But others have expressed anger at the lifestyle he seems to be enjoying. Hevaa Makemsonn wrote: ‘Basically has a bedsit rent-free. Good one, government.’ It is not known where Crocker is serving his sentence but sources said the pictures were not HMP Dartmoor, near Plymouth. Philip Davies, Tory candidate for Shipley, said it showed ‘how soft and lax’ prison has become. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘This behaviour is totally unacceptable. Anyone caught accessing social networking sites will be subject to strict disciplinary action.’ Creature comforts: Crocker has a bathroom area and an assortment of bread, sugar and various condements . Reveling in his 'king-pin lifestyle' the dealer has a New York City bedspread and keeps his tabacco nearby . Crocker has plenty of space to hang pictures of his friends and family and they too have the opportunity to keep up with his antics through the images of prison life he shared on Facebook .

Article text: Sex crazed: Dr. Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' caused him to lose his license . A doctor has had his license suspended after bizarre, sexually-fueled behavior at work, says the state Department of Heath. Dr. Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' including using medical images for sexual gratification and having sexual encounters at his workplace led to his license being suspended by the Medical Commission on June 5, 2014. Seattle Pi reports that a subsequent hearing reviewing the charges led to the indefinite suspension. Zilberstein must undergo a mental and behavioral evaluation and pay a $5,000 fine. He will be able to peitition for the reinstatement of his medical license only after he completes the mandated evaluation and recommendations. The anesthesiologist, from Seattle, Washington, also allegedly sent explicit texts while performing C-sections and naked selfies to a patient at Swedish Medical Center where he worked. The charges said some of the pictures were 'depicting himself in hospital scrubs, wearing his hospital badge and exposing his genitals'. Washington state health authorities said 47-year-old Zilberstein repeatedly compromised patient safety between at least April 2013 and August 2013. Authorities accused Zilberstein, who has been in practice since 1995, of issuing at least 29 unauthorized prescriptions for controlled substances and other drugs. Anesthesiologist also allegedly sent texts while performing operations . The charges, filed with the state Medical Quality Assurance Commission, also allege that Zilberstein prescribed unauthorized narcotics to a female patient he had sex with, NBC News reported. On one day alone, June 17, 2013, he is accused of sending 64 texts, many just minutes apart, during seven surgeries, many of which had sexual innuendos. Inappropriate behavior: Dr. Arthur Zilbertstein, an anesthesiologist, allegedly sent explicit texts while performing C-sections and naked selfies to a patient at Swedish Medical Center where he worked . One read: 'I'm hella busy with C sections.' Another read: 'Oh. And my partner walked in as I was pulling up my scrubs. I'm pretty sure he caught me.' The charges state: 'Respondent's lack of focus on patient care while providing anesthesia services for hospital-based surgical procedures routinely fell below the standard of care and put patients at unreasonable risk of harm.' Zilberstein also demonstrated 'moral turpitude' that reflected badly on the medical profession. He was contracted through Physicians Anesthesia Services with Swedish Medical Center to provide care , NBC News reported. Hospital spokesman Clay Holtzman said: 'The safety of our patients is our number one priority. Once we learned that the state had suspended this physician's medical license, the physician's medical staff membership and privileges were immediately suspended. 'We just recently learned of these allegations and are conducting our own internal review of the physician, who is not directly employed by Swedish.' No longer employed: Dr. Arthur Zilbertstein is no longer employed at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle .

Article text: Roy Keane has the ‘broad shoulders and mental toughness’ required to manage Manchester United, according to his former Old Trafford engine room colleague, Paul Ince. Ince, 47, a double-winner with Keane at United in 1994, on Thursday hailed the Irish assistant manager as ‘a leader of men.’ ‘I speak to Roy and he does want to get back in (to management) but at the right establishment, with the right project. Roy Keane is not a number two, Roy Keane is a leader of men,’ said Ince. Roy Keane has the ‘mental toughness’ required to manage Manchester United, says Paul Ince . Ince slides in for a tackle during United's game against Sheffield Wednesday in 1992 . ‘And if the right thing (job) comes along then I’m sure he will get back into it (management).’ Keane was last in charge at Ipswich over four years ago but even so Ince is convinced the 43-year-old will ‘be a top, top manager’ and could even return to the front-line at United. ‘To be Man United manager you need broad shoulders and take a lot of criticism. Roy has broad shoulders and he is mentally tough. Things don’t affect him,’ said Ince. ‘He has a poker face, doesn’t show if things are affecting him, and there is no reason why Roy couldn’t go back to Manchester United (as manager).’ ‘You cannot lose people like him from the game,’ warned Ince. ‘He knows so much about football, no matter what your cup of tea is. Ince is convinced Keane, who was last in charge of Ipswich four years ago, will ‘be a top, top manager’ ‘Some people love him, some people hate him. You always try to guess what Keanie’s like but he does not let people into his head.’ ‘He’s got a vast knowledge of football and he sets the highest standards. You don’t get the players anymore with Roy’s standards,’ he added. ‘You do hear people say “Roy rules by fear.” Maybe, that’s Roy and the way he is. Maybe, that’s how he feels he can be a success in what he does and he did it at Sunderland.’ ‘Roy Keane has an ego. We all had egos at Man United because that’s what made us who we were,’ he added. Ince rejected any suggestion that Ryan Giggs (left) might succeed Louis van Gaal as United boss . Ince rejected any suggestion that Ryan Giggs might succeed Louis Van Gaal at United. ‘No chance,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to go to a club that you can learn from and get experience. He’s not ready for Man United.’ Ince didn’t rule out Keane succeeding Martin O’Neill as Irish manager. ‘Maybe he (Keane) thinks that when Martin’s done, then he’s the next one to step up. That’s the logic I see in it,’ he said. ‘International football is hard because it’s once every month or two months. I think Keanie would like to be on the training ground every day,’ cautioned Ince.

Article text: A French court has ruled that that it has jurisdiction to judge a case against Facebook, after the U.S.-based social network blocked a man's account for posting a painting of a woman's genitals. The Frenchman, a teacher and a father-of-three, posted an explicit 19th-century oil painting depicting the lower half of a naked woman in 2011, and was subsequently blocked. The man sued Facebook that year, but lawyers representing the social network has argued that it does not fall under French jurisdiction. Blocked account: The Frenchman, a teacher and father-of-three, was blocked after posting an image of Gustave Coubet's painting The Origin Of The World on his Facebook account . The unnamed man had posted an image of  Gustave Coubet's painting The Origin Of The World on the social networking site four years ago. He claims he missed messages and 'social contact' from his 800 Facebook friends when the page was taken down on the eve of his birthday on February 27, 2011. At the time, the unnamed man's lawyer Stephane Cottineau said repeated emails to the California based company demanding the page be reinstated had also gone unanswered. He added: 'This blind censorship and refusal to reply to emails suggests he is not worthy of their attention and is someone who has acted immorally or illegally. 'Deleting his account is a breach of his human rights, which guarantees my client's freedom of expression. French rules: The Paris court has ruled that that it does have jurisdiction to judge a case against Facebook, despite the U.S.-based social network arguing it has to be done in California . 'It is also in breach of his rights as a consumer under French law.' Earlier this year, Facebook's lawyer Caroline Lyannaz argued that the site did not fall under French jurisdiction as users have to sign a clause agreeing that only a California court can rule in disputes relating to the firm. Facebook's rules state users 'will not post content that is hateful, threatening, or pornographic, or that incites violence, or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.' However, a Paris court ruled yesterday that Facebook's clause forcing all users to agree that any litigation must be based in the U.S. state, where the site is based, was 'abusive'. Mr Cottineau hailed the court ruling as a 'first victory won by David against Goliath'. 'This decision will create jurisprudence for other social media and other Internet giants who use their being headquartered abroad, mainly in the United States, to attempt to evade French law.' The lawyer said this was an 'abusive clause' as none of the 22 million Facebook users in France 'can ever take recourse to French legal jurisdiction in the event of a dispute.' Facebook said it noted the judgement and was considering its response. The court will hear the case on May 21.

Article text: Loss: Corrine Gump, 10, and her grandparents were killed in an early morning fire on Monday . A 10-year-old alleged rape victim and her grandparents have died in a massive fire at their home just hours before her suspected attacker was set to go on trial. Corrine Gump and her maternal grandparents, Judith Schmidt, 61, and William Schmidt, 63, who were both deaf, lost their lives in the early-morning blaze in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday. Neighbors reported hearing loud explosions at 3.30am before the fire tore through the house. Later that day, Robert Seman, Jr., 46, was set to stand trial on four counts of rape and four counts of gross sexual imposition. Seman, himself a father to a two-year-old child, had been accused of abusing Corrine from when she was just four years old until she was eight, WFMJ reported, citing an indictment from a year ago. Since April last year, he had been under electronically-monitored house arrest but on Monday his bond was revoked because he allegedly tried to bribe a witness in the rape case, WFMJ reported. Authorities said he had not been taken back into custody because of the fire. Investigators said they have found no evidence that the origin of the blaze was suspicious. But because Corinne was an alleged victim, the Youngstown Police are involved in the investigation, Sergeant Ron Barber told WKYC. Scroll down for video . Accused: It came just hours before Robert Seman, Jr., 46, (pictured) was set to go on trial for charges that he had sexually assaulted her. He was under house arrest and electronic monitoring at the time of the fire . Authorities looking to interview the girl's mother on Monday said that they found her at a house listed in court records as Seman’s house arrest address, WKBN reported. When they had checked for her there earlier that morning, she had not be in, they said. Neighbors told 21 News that they heard two explosions and one neighbor said she awoke to what she thought was a flickering light outside. 'It was fully involved,' Fire Chief John O'Neill told The Youngstown Vindicator. 'We had quite a bit of fire in the basement, so that's the likely origin. They had fire all through the house, top to bottom. The floors were giving way almost immediately upon entry.' The three bodies were found on the second floor. It is not yet clear if they had smoke detectors in the home. Smoke detectors for the hearing-impaired can send vibrations, sound or light to alert residents. Steve Leland, director of Easter Seals Youngstown Hearing and Speech Center Community Center, told the Vindicator that the local deaf community is mourning the loss of the couple. Battle: Firefighters pulled the three bodies from the second floor of the home on Monday morning . Destruction: Fire officers said the blaze quickly ripped through the home from bottom to top. But they said there was no evidence that the cause of the fire was suspicious . Questions: Fire Captain Kurt Wright and a State Fire Marshall look into the back of the house on Monday as an investigation continues into the cause of the fire. Neighbors reported hearing explosions . 'Bill and Judy were always willing to talk to parents who'd just found out they had a deaf child,' he said. 'They would often discuss options for raising a deaf child, talking about their own personal life experiences, being deaf themselves, and raising deaf children.' The couple had three children, two of whom are deaf. William Schmidt was a retired AT&T lineman, while his wife taught deaf people sign language, the publication reported. 'They were very outgoing, very sweet people, always ready to help,' Leland added. Corrine was a 4th grade student at South Range School, where officials have assembled a crisis team to counsel students and staff affected by the tragedy. Seman's trial has been delayed in light of the deaths but no new date has yet been set. He could face life in prison if convicted of the charges. See below for video .

Burglars targeted the heavily guarded building site which has been hit by several setbacks since construction began in the heart of the German capital nine years ago . That led to a massive leak that caused an estimated millions of euros  in damage, according to media reports. The motive was unclear as the taps are only thought to be worth a few hundred euros. The foreign intelligence agency (BND) declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the federal construction agency which manages the building site only confirmed the theft. The site is guarded by a private firm and monitored by dozens of security cameras. Heavy security: The site is guarded by a private firm and monitored by dozens of CCTV cameras (above) German media leapt on the incident as one more embarrassment for the country's spy chiefs over the new complex. Berlin's daily Tagesspiegel splashed the headline: 'Watergate at the new BND building'. The move of the BND to the German capital from its current headquarters in Bavaria with some 3,000 staff members has been delayed several times and is currently scheduled for 2017. In 2011, the agency was forced to admit that the blueprints for the new complex had been stolen but played down the security risks posed by the loss.

Article text: A woman who claims to have captured paranormal activity on camera says he is being haunted by the ghost of her dead brother with whom she had a troubled relationship. Donna Ayres, 33, says she has moved house five times in order to try and escape the spirit, but it has followed her each time. The mother-of-four, from Burnley, Lancashire, says she has been left with bruises from the ghoul, and on one occasion was pinned down to the bed. In another video taken by Ms Ayres a spoon begins moving around on her kitchen counter (pictured) The spoon appears to be dragged around by some unseen force before standing up on its end and beginning to spin around on its tip . She even claims to have captured some of the hauntings on film, including levitating spoons, light fixtures swinging from the ceiling, and a Ouija board flying across the room. Ms Ayres, who lives with partner Jason Heys, 45, said the disturbances began happening in 2009 around the time her brother Paul passed away. She said: 'Ever since my brother died strange things have occurred in every house I’ve lived in, it’s been a living hell. Among the spooky happenings that Ms Ayres has recorded is a light fixture swinging from the ceiling . 'Probably the worst time was when I was pinned to the bed, I’ll never forget it - it was very traumatic. 'I believe this is happening because death has always followed me, but I have strong suspicions the spirit could be my brother, who died when I was younger. 'We had a very troubled relationship, perhaps that’s why he’s come back to haunt me.' Ms Ayres said she began trying to capture the ghost's movements on film with her camera phone after people began doubting her story. However she now believes she has angered the spirit after the spooky happenings have become more common. She added: 'The paranormal activity first started in 2009 when I began to hear bangs at night, and then scratches appeared on the wall. 'Since these first encounters I've had nothing but rampant paranormal activity in every house I've lived in, I'm just at the end of my tether. 'I have even woke up with bruises some mornings, despite not being in contact with anyone. 'It's hard to get the footage as sometimes the paranormal activity is too quick to film, but I think I've done well to catch what I have with a basic camera phone. The mother-of-four, who lives with partner Jason Heys, 45, says she has moved house five times in order to escape the ghost, but says it is following her from property to property . Ms Ayres said she began recording the incidents (which included a levitating spoon) to convince people of her story, but now fears she may have angered the spirit . 'Given the rocky relationship with my brother, I genuinely believe this ghost is haunting me, not just the house which I live in, which is the most terrifying thing.' The videos have sparked a furious debate on social media, with a swathe of paranormal investigators offering to conduct a thorough paranormal investigation into the disturbances. According to Sefton Paranormal Investigators, if the video footage is genuine, this type of paranormal phenomenon would be classified as a poltergeist - a supernatural being often blamed for physical disturbances. Ms Ayres believes the poltergeist could be brother Paul (pictured) who died in 2009. She described their relationship as 'fraught'

Article text: The Food and Drug Administration is keeping a bold-letter warning on Pfizer's anti-smoking drug Chantix about suicidal behavior and other psychiatric side effects, after reviewing company findings suggesting the drug does not increase those problems. The twice-a-day tablet has carried the FDA's strongest warning label since 2009, following reports of suicidal tendencies and violent or bizarre behavior among some patients. The FDA on Monday outlined several updates to Chantix's labeling, including a new warning about its potential interaction with alcohol. Some patients have reported unusual or aggressive behavior when drinking while on Chantix. Caution: Anti-smoking drug Chantix has carried the FDA's strongest warning label since 2009, following reports of suicidal tendencies and violent or bizarre behavior among some patients . 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that the prescription smoking cessation medicine Chantix (varenicline) can change the way people react to alcohol,' the agency said. 'In addition, rare accounts of seizures in patients treated with Chantix have been reported. We have approved changes to the Chantix label to warn about these risks. Until patients know how Chantix affects their ability to tolerate alcohol, they should decrease the amount of alcohol they drink. Patients who have a seizure while taking Chantix should stop the medicine and seek medical attention immediately.' The updated labeling also includes information from several studies and analyses conducted by Pfizer that found no difference in psychiatric problems between people taking Chantix and other stop-smoking treatments. 'These studies did not show an increased risk of neuropsychiatric side effects with Chantix; however, they did not examine all types of neuropsychiatric side effects, and they had limitations that prevented us from drawing reliable conclusions,' the FDA said. Last year Pfizer proposed that the FDA remove Chantix's so-called black box warning based on the company's findings and other data. Warning: The FDA on Monday outlined several updates to Chantix's labeling, including a new warning about its potential interaction with alcohol. Some patients have reported unusual or aggressive behavior when drinking while on Chantix . The agency's update follows the recommendation of a panel of outside experts, who voted last October to keep the boxed warning on the drug until it can be reevaluated based on new information. New York-based Pfizer is expected to complete a larger study of Chantix's psychiatric side effects in late 2015. Chantix's safety has been debated in medical journals and courtrooms since 2007, when reports of suicide, agitation and other problems first began streaming into the FDA. The drug's labeling currently tells patients to stop taking Chantix immediately if they experience agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thinking and other behavioral changes. Doctors are advised to weigh the drug's risks against its potential benefits of helping patients quit smoking. Pfizer's drug works by binding to the same spots in the brain that are activated by nicotine when people smoke. The drug, known generically as varenicline, blocks nicotine from binding to those spots and prevents the release of 'feel-good' brain chemicals that make smoking so addictive.

Article text: The health service is facing scores of claims relating to Jimmy Savile, after almost £60,000 was paid out in relation to the first three cases of people abused by the former DJ . The NHS has paid out £12million to patients sexually abused in hospitals, GP surgeries and dental practices in the last two decades, it can be revealed. More than 400 claims have been made against NHS workers since 1996, with dozens more assaulted by non-clinical staff. Now the health service is facing scores of claims relating to Jimmy Savile, after almost £60,000 was paid out in relation to the first three cases of people abused by the former DJ. The Department of Health insists changes have been made to change the culture in the health service to encourage staff and patients to speak up and be listened to. The NHS is one of several public sector institutions rocked by revelations about Savile's reign of terror on wards across the country. A damning report ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last month revealed the TV and radio personality was given unfettered access to the NHS where he raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals. The catalogue of abuse has raised serious questions about the NHS's failure to protect patients, especially children, from the paedophile. Kate Lampard, who carried out a review into the way the NHS handles abuse claims, warned that 'most NHS organisations still do not have adequately explicit and robust processes for managing their relationships with celebrities, important visitors, fundraisers and donors'. The Savile reports were dismissed as a 'cover up' by victims after NHS chiefs were cleared of any wrongdoing. Details of litigation claims obtained by MailOnline reveal the scale of abuse carried out by NHS staff over several years. From 1996 to 2014, there were a total of 407 claims of clinical staff abusing patients in the NHS. The NHS Litigation Authority paid out a total of £11.6million, which included £5.3million in damages and £4.2million in claimants' costs. A further £2million was spent on defence costs. The number of claims varied markedly from year to year, from just a handful in the late 1990s, to 60 claims in 2001-02, of which 19 were successful. From 2000 to 2014, a total of 61 claims have been made about abuse carried out in the NHS by non-clinical staff. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the NHS Litigation Authority will pay compensation to victims of Savile after the £2.9million in the disgraced star's estate have run out . More than half – some 37 – were submitted in 2013-14, which reflects the impact of the so-called 'Savile effect' of people coming forward in the wake of revelations about his abuse which emerged in late 2012. One claim from 2013-14 was unsuccessful and the other 36 were classed as still open. In the 14 years covered, just £80,681 was paid out in damages for abuse by non-clinical staff, while £101,252 was spent defending claims. However, the Department of Health has revealed that the first payments have now been made to victims of Savile. Liz Dux, from lawyers Slater and Gordon, is representing around 50 people making claims of abuse against the NHS . The disgraced star died in 2011, and his estate – estimated to be worth £2.9million – was liable for claims by the victims of his abuse. Ministers said that if the funds do not cover all valid claims, then the NHS Litigation Authority would step in. The Department of Health said that so far £58,625 has been paid out to three claimants, including £18,125 in compensation and £40,500 costs. The payments were made in December 2014. Lawyers acting for abuse victims expect more to follow, and accuse the NHS of being slow to react. Liz Dux, from lawyers Slater and Gordon, is representing around 50 people making claims of abuse against the NHS. 'We have seen a big rise in cases against medical practitioners particularly locum GPs, she said' 'People who are abused sexually by doctors a lot of the time come out thinking, did that happen? 'Doctors or medical practitioners who sexually abuse are often quite clever about it. People come out thinking was that supposed to happen. They want to have faith in the doctor they are going to. 'People are questioning much more what they had concerns about all along but not voiced them at the time.' She added: 'The Department of Health has been incredibly slow on Savile which is causing people a lot of concern because they just want to put it behind them.' Alison Millar, from law firm Leigh Day, is representing some victims of Savile but several others who have suffered abuse in the NHS more recently. 'These claims do go on and sadly it is not just an historic problem, to do with Jimmy Savile. 'When you talk about the Savile effect, generally what you mean is people who have been living with the effects of abuse for many years. 'What we are seeing in addition to people who were abused in childhood and are coming forward, now we are seeing claims coming forward in relation to the NHS and a number of cases involving children at schools with special educational needs. She suggested people were now more willing to speak out: 'There is a climate in which ill-treatment which in a rather British way we would have looked the other war and not done anything about it people are now ready to come forward.' A damning report ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last month revealed how Savile was given unfettered access to the NHS where he raped and sexually assaulted patients in 41 hospitals . The Department of Health stressed that extensive changes have been made in safeguarding patients over the past quarter of a century, including criminal records checks and key agencies working together better to safeguard children, young people and adults. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has accepted 13 recommendations from Kate Lampard's report. All health trusts are to review their current practice in three months and report back on their progress. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We have a responsibility to make sure that patients are safe. 'All trusts have been asked to review their safeguarding practices and will report back with action plans for any improvement needed against Kate Lampard's recommendations. 'Importantly we are also working to encourage a culture within the NHS where staff and patients feel supported to speak up, to challenge and be listened to.'

Article text: When the Queen ascended to the throne in 1952, the latest thing in ship design was the Orient Line's Oronsay, a 1,500-passenger vessel built by Vickers-Armstrong at its yard in Barrow-in-Furness. The excellent P&O Heritage website offers fascinating glimpses of life on board - all tea dances and cucumber sandwiches. What a change there is today. The bow of Britannia carries a huge stylised Union Jack, which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device, but broadcasts a British heritage which has been brought bang up to date . You feel that the latest P&O vessel Britannia, which the Queen officially named last Monday in Southampton, could fit the Oronsay on to one deck. However, they are not just vessels from different eras - they come from wholly dissimilar philosophies. Oronsay was built primarily to get passengers from Tilbury to Sydney - fun was considered to be a fancy dress party or the odd beetle drive. Britannia has been purposefully built for enjoyment. It is an entertainment monster, bristling with fun on almost every deck. It is, to borrow a line from poetry, a stately pleasure dome. It's customary to bemoan the compromised standards of the modern era, to yearn for the sturdier certainties of times past. Cruising, at least, is one area where newer almost always means better. P&O Cruises may be part of the American Carnival corporation these days but, happily, it remains British to the tips of its mastheads. The bow of Britannia carries a huge stylised Union Jack, which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device, but broadcasts a British heritage which has been brought bang up to date. The ambassadors for modern P&O Cruises are chefs such as Marco Pierre White, Atul Kochar and James Martin because it is in the area of food, strangely enough, in which the UK has begun to lead the world. Another area where we set the standard is in hotels: the international success of Nick Jones and his Soho House group has ushered in a new era of laid-back elegance. It is this very style that Britannia has captured so impressively. The modern era of British cruising, which P&O Cruises began with the Oriana more than 20 years ago, has now achieved an apotheosis with Britannia. For those poor holiday limpets who will not consider cruising because they refuse to acknowledge the emergence of what is arguably the purest form of holidaymaking, I have one piece of advice: be ruled by Britannia because Britannia really does rule the waves.

Article text: George Coetzee and Marcel Siem kept their hopes of qualifying for the Masters very much alive on the opening day of the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal. Both men had the daunting task of knowing only a victory in Morocco would be enough to book a trip to Augusta next month for the first major championship of the year. But they got off to excellent starts on Thursday, with South Africa's Coetzee carding a 67 and Siem a 68 to finish two and three shots respectively behind France's Adrien Saddier. German Marcel Siem watches on during the opening day of the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal . Siem, chasing a spot at next month's Masters, shot a round of 68 to stay in contention for the title in Morocco . Saddier, who was one shot off the lead before the final round of the Madeira Islands Open was cancelled due to bad weather on Sunday, made the most of his sponsor's invite to card a flawless 65. The 22-year-old chipped in on the first for an eagle and repeated the trick on the sixth for the first of his five birdies to finish one shot ahead of England's Daniel Gaunt, who carded seven birdies and a solitary bogey on the 18th. Coetzee shared third place with Scotland's David Drysdale and England's Chris Wood, with Siem a shot further back after five birdies, an eagle and three bogeys in his round. Starting from the 10th, Coetzee - who won the Tshwane Open on his home course in Pretoria a fortnight ago - birdied his first two holes and also picked up shots on the 16th and 17th to reach the turn in 32. George Coetzee carded 67 on Thursday to remain near the top of the leaderboard in Morocco . Further birdies on the first and seventh took Coetzee to six under, but the 28-year-old ran up a double bogey on the next after his tee shot rolled back off the green and his first chip caught the same slope and came back to his feet. However, the world number 69 made amends with a birdie from 20 feet on the ninth, just minutes after Siem had holed from an almost identical position. 'Augusta is on my mind, obviously,' Coetzee said. 'I'm here to try to qualify, but I'm just trying to play golf and hopefully on Sunday I will be in contention. Coetzee prepares to take a tee shot on the opening day of the Hassan Trophy at Golf du Palais Royal . 'There is still a lot of work to be done. If it all doesn't work out then I've got a nice five-week holiday. I'm just playing and enjoying my golf. I'm in a good space mentally.' Siem led from start to finish here in 2013 and looked to have done enough to climb into the world's top 50 and secure his Masters debut. However, after the results of the Houston Open were taken into consideration a few hours later, the 34-year-old discovered he was ranked 51st and had missed out by just 0.03 world ranking points. 'It's a big week for me and four under is a good start,' Siem told Sky Sports 4. 'I'm really excited about playing the Masters, I've never played it. I finished it off two years ago and still did not get in. It was a little horrible. World No 69 Coetzee must win the title this weekend to qualify to play in the Masters at Augusta . 'I'm going to keep doing what I did today, try hard not to make any stupid mistakes. I have got the experience and I know the golf course. I will make enough birdies I reckon....just (need to) avoid the mistakes.' Siem and Coetzee were not the only members of the field with Georgia on their minds, with Alexander Levy, Andy Sullivan, Tommy Fleetwood and Ross Fisher all having chances to move into the top 50 before Monday's deadline. Fleetwood was the best placed of that quartet after an opening 70, with Levy recording a 72 and Sullivan two over following a 74, while Fisher struggled to a 77 which was matched by defending champion Alejandro Canizares.

Article text: Enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the E.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water, a study has suggested. Scientists at the University of Exeter have warned of the danger after analysing data collected from beaches across England and Wales in 2012. They focused on a strain of E.coli bacteria resistant to an important class of antibiotics called third-generation cephalosporins, or 3GCs. Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the E.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water, a study has suggested . Study leader Dr William Gaze said: 'We know very little about how the natural environment can spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans, or how our exposure to these microbes can affect health. 'People are exposed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in many ways, through person-to-person contact, via food and as a result of international travel. 'Our research establishes recreational use of coastal waters as an additional route of exposure. 'With millions of people visiting beaches in England and Wales each year, there is a risk of people ingesting 3GC resistant E. coli and it looks like water-users' exposure to all resistant bacteria could be even higher.' If you enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up a strain of E.coli bacteria (pictured) resistant to an important class of antibiotics . Salt in sea water is known to kill off some bacteria, but not all. Although only 0.12 per cent of the E.coli found in coastal waters and rivers running on to beaches belonged to the strain, researchers said this was enough to present a 'potential risk'. The study, published in the journal Environment International, showed risk of exposure was closely related to the water quality at any given beach. Researchers said this demonstrated the importance of the EU's Bathing Water Directive, which aims to ensure good water quality standards, but added that people should not be put off visiting the seaside.

Article text: Stripped of its skin, and showing every bone and sinew, this gory display of an elephant is part of the latest exhibition from the infamous Dr Gunther von Hagens. Body Worlds: Animal Inside Out, in which animal carcasses are preserved and displayed, opens today at Ambassador Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Created by plastinator Dr von Hagens and curator Dr. Angelina Whalley, the exhibition offers visitors an 'anatomical safari' past nearly one hundred anatomically dissected animals. Scroll down for video . Samba the elephant, which at 3.2 tons and 6metres by 3.5 metres in size is the largest animal ever plastinated, is on display at the Body Worlds: Animal Inside Out exhibition . Some  have been given the full-body plastinate process, while a series of 'single specimens' offer preserved organs or even slices of animal. The graphic exhibition features Samba the elephant which, at 3.2 tons and a size of 6 by 3.5 metres, is the largest whole animal ever plastinated. Samba is joined by a gorilla packing 120 kilograms of muscle, watched on by its human close relative, as well as a giraffe, bear, shark and many more. 'It is fascinating to see the anatomical similarities of the vertebrates on the one hand, and how many different anatomical variations have formed on the other hand in response to an animal's living conditions—such as the elephant's trunk or the giraffe's long neck,' says the curator Dr. Angelina Whalley on the exhibition website. Step 1. Embalming and Anatomical Dissection He halts decay by pumping formalin into the body through the arteries. Using dissection tools, the skin, fatty and connective tissues are removed in order to prepare the individual anatomical structures. Steep 2. Removal of Body Fat and Water The body water and soluble fats are dissolved from the body by placing it into an acetone bath. Step 3. Forced Impregnation A reactive polymer - silicone rubber -  replaces the acetone. The specimen is immersed in a polymer solution and placed in vacuum chamber. The vacuum removes the acetone from the specimen and helps the polymer to penetrate every last cell. Step 4. Positioning After vacuum impregnation, the body is positioned as desired. Every single anatomical structure is properly aligned and fixed with the help of wires, needles, clamps, and foam blocks. Step 5. Curing (Hardening) The specimen is hardened with gas, light, or heat. Dissection and Plastination of an entire body requires about 1,500 working hours and normally takes about one year to complete . It aims to illustrate the complexity of the animals' insides, and how different animals have adapted both their anatomy and their organ function to their natural habitats. The exhibition uses plastination, a technique developed by German anatomist Dr von Hagens in 1977 for preserving biological tissue specimen. The process is used in anatomy to preserve bodies or body parts, by replacing water and fat with certain plastics, to create specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay. Plastination was originally used to preserve small specimens for medical study. It was only in the early 1990s that techniques were developed to plastinate whole body specimens. Each could take up to 1,500 person-hours to prepare. Plastination is now used at more than 40 medical and dental schools throughout the world as an adjunct to anatomical dissection. Von Hagens went on to form the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany in 1993 which made their first showing of plastinated bodies in Japan in 1995, which drew more than three million visitors. Over the next two years, Von Hagens developed the Body Worlds public exhibitions, showing whole bodies, donated by willing donors, plastinated in lifelike poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy. More than 10,000 people have agreed to donate their bodies to Institute for Plastination. Past exhibitions have included a display in Barcelona, Spain which was mainly composed of plastinated Asian body parts and embryos. His most complex work so far is said to be the giraffe which appeared in 'Body Worlds 3 & The Story of the Heart'. The specimen took three years to complete – 10 times longer than a human. The current exhibition, which is at Ambassador Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was was made possible through cooperation with various veterinary programs and zoos with no animals harmed or killed for use. Student Kifah Ajamia looks at a horse's head, as nearly 100 anatomically dissected animals go on display at the Ambassador Theatre in Dublin . An intricate display shows a chicken's blood vessels and veins which have been preserved using a technique called plastination . But many of Dr von Hagens' exhibitions- dubbed Dr Tod (Dr Death) in Germany - have drawn criticism from religious groups. Members of the Catholic Church said that his displays of human remains is disrespectful. But that hasn't stopped museums and venues in cities across the world hosting Body Worlds, which has attracted more than 29 million visitors. The professor has continually courted controversy throughout his career and in 2005 in a four-part series on Channel 4 called Anatomy for Beginners, he dissected cadavers on live TV. He followed up in 2006 with Autopsy: Life and Death. His laboratory later angered German Christians when it began to offer body parts for sale online, including plastinated 'slices' of corpses including a human head. In 2011, he announced he was dying of Parkinson's disease and has said he wants his own body displayed in the same manner as his specimens when his time comes. Dr Gunther von Hagens at the opening of his plastinarium in Guben, Germany . Born in Poland in 1945, von Hagens was diagnosed with a rare bleeding disorder and almost died aged six. Aged 20, he entered the University of Jena medical school where he began to oppose the Communist system under which he lived. Attempting to flee to Austrian in 1969, he was imprisoned for two years. Aged 26, his freedom was bought by West Germany where he completed his medical studies and entered the field of pathology. In 1975, he began to experiment with the preservation of body parts using reactive polymers. He said: 'I wondered why the . plastic was poured and then cured around the specimens rather than . pushed into the cells, which would stabilise the specimens from within . and literally allow you to grasp it.' By 1982, von Hagens patented the plastination technique which has been adopted in laboratories across the world. In 1995, he premiered Body Worlds in Japan and the show has been seen by more than 28million people since, despite fierce opposition in some quarters. Between 2005- 2006 he dissected cadavers live on television .

Article text: Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton said an 18-year-old who was raped near a Leeds bus stop was 'left for dead' and found lying in a pool of blood . A teenage girl was 'left for dead' after being raped at a bus stop, police confirmed as they said they are hunting for a man who would likely have been left with blood on his hands or clothing after the violent attack. The rape of an 18-year-old girl at a bus stop in Leeds in West Yorkshire is now being treated as attempted murder after the youngster suffered severe injuries and was left needing surgery. Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'We are now treating this as an attempted murder because she has been left there for dead.' The officer has encouraged people to come forward with information about the attack and said this is 'no time for family loyalty.' The Asian teenager was grabbed from behind by a man,  in his 20s and also believed to be Asian, in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds. He dragged her into a garden and raped her just before 11pm on Friday night. She was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with head injuries, a possible broken hip, and lying in blood. DCI Belford added:  'It has been a very nasty attack that has been sustained over some time. 'The nature of her injuries are that she has suffered facial and head injuries and also a suspected broken hip.' The suspect is described as an Asian man in his early 20s with a slim build and dark receding hair. Police said they believe he had been in the area for a while before the attack took place. Scroll down for video . Police found the girl lying on the ground suffering head injuries but it later emerged she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. Officers said the road was very busy at the time of the attack and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. DCI Belford said: 'I would encourage people to think – was there something out of place – or did someone come home with blood on their shirt? A team of specialist forensic officers spent Saturday recovering evidence from where the girl was found . Police said they are looking for an Asian man in his early 20s of slim build with receding dark coloured hair . 'This is no time for family loyalty – this was an horrific incident and the victim is lucky to be alive.' Officers said they do not believe the attack was racially motivated and wanted to put an end to any speculation. They confirmed the victim was Asian. 'I think it is possible that someone will know [the attacker] as there was a considerable amount of blood that was at the scene,' said DCI Belford. 'It's possible that the person responsible will have had blood on their hands and possibly blood on their clothing.' The teenager was raped as she waited at a bus stop, pictured, near Leeds City centre late on Friday night . Officers were looking for any hair or fibres that could help them identify the suspect who is in his 20s . The 18-year-old was attacked near Malvern Road and Beeston Road in Leeds at about 22:40pm on Friday. Police are appealing for people to come forward - including a woman who is believed to have been standing at the bus stop shortly before the attack who then got on a number 1 or 47 bus. They also want to speak to a man who was jogging in the area. DCI Belton said the crime had 'shocked the community.' Anyone with any information are asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Article text: Nicola Sturgeon is behaving like Vladimir Putin by 'stoking division in England', a senior Tory warns. In a provocative intervention, Ben Wallace last night accused Scotland's First Minister of trying to break up Britain using the same tactics as the Russian president in the early days of the Ukraine crisis. Miss Sturgeon will use her keynote speech at the SNP's conference in Glasgow today to insist that she will 'demand an end to slash and burn austerity' in return for propping up Ed Miliband in Downing Street. A senior Tory  has said Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (right) is behaving like Russia's Vladimir Putin (left) by 'stoking division in England' She will claim to be sending a 'message of friendship and solidarity' to English voters who want an end to spending cuts that 'tear at the very fabric of society'. But Mr Wallace, a serving government whip who was once a Member of the Scottish Parliament, last night accused her of masterminding a plot designed to anger English voters and hasten the break-up of the UK. 'Nicola Sturgeon is intent on stoking division in England in the same way Putin used it to break apart Ukraine,' he said. 'I'm talking about the early days in the Ukraine crisis, before the tanks, when he spread division and fear in order for it to splinter apart. 'Separatists all over the world use division and nationalism to break up countries. Sturgeon may dress it up as friendliness, but that is what she wants – she wants England to tell the Scots to get lost. 'Labour could stop this if Miliband said he would not proceed with legislation... that could not get through without SNP votes. But if Labour's greed for power allows her to succeed, then God help the UK.' Miss Sturgeon has previously provoked anger by saying she would 'lock the Tories out' of Downing Street in the event of a hung parliament – even if they win the most seats. Miss Sturgeon has said she has no qualms about installing Mr Miliband (pictured) in No 10 . She said she would have no qualms about installing Mr Miliband in No 10, despite believing that Scotland should not even be part of the UK. But she warned she would push for 'an end to austerity and the non-renewal of Trident' in return. Treasury figures show the SNP's plans would involve an extra £148billion of spending – leading to higher borrowing and taxes. However polls predict the party could win more than 50 of Scotland's 59 seats at the election – and could potentially prop up a minority Labour government. Miss Sturgeon will claim today that her party's Left-wing stance appeals to millions of voters in England. She will tell activists: 'To ordinary people across these islands who feel just as let down by the out of touch Westminster system as we do, I have a very clear message. 'It is a message of friendship and solidarity. As long as Scotland remains part of the Westminster system, we will be your allies in seeking to reform that outdated system. 'So to people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, I make this promise. The SNP stands ready to work with you. We will demand an alternative to slash and burn austerity.' Former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth accused Miss Sturgeon of 'arrogance' for boasting that she could hand power to Labour even if it loses the election. He said: 'We have had the Scottish referendum, which she lost, and now she wants to dictate policy to England – what arrogance. The SNP has demonstrated that it is deeply socialist – far worse even than Labour.' He said it would be 'catastrophic' for the UK if the SNP held the balance of power, as it would lead to 'more spending and borrowing, higher taxes and weaker defences'. Fellow Tory Michael Ellis said Labour appeared to have been 'taken hostage' by the SNP. 'It is quite clear that Alex Salmond will ride roughshod over Miliband and hold him to ransom for a very high price.'

Article text: Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance . The first known works by one of Britain's finest composers, Sir Hubert Parry, who wrote the music for Jerusalem, are being sold at auction. The 70 documents, expected to fetch up to £50,000, represent Parry's earliest surviving work and include pieces written when he was an Eton schoolboy and at Oxford. Many of the pieces have never been played in public, but a premiere before the Prince of Wales, a champion of Parry's music, is to take place in May. Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance. As well as Jersualem, he wrote many famous settings for English hymns, including Repton, a well-known tune for Dear Lord And Father Of Mankind. Parry's setting of the anthem I Was Glad has been played at the Coronations of every Monarch since Edward VII and was performed at the Westminster Abbey wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1981. In a BBC4 documentary about Parry's music, Charles said: 'It gives you tingles up the spine and tears in your eyes.' Parry's version of The Magnificat And Nunc Dimittis In D, and an anthem entitled O Sing Unto The Lord, are considered the best of the cache and will be sung for the first time by the choir at Gloucester Cathedral. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19. It is an appropriate venue because Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848-1918) grew up just two miles from Gloucester, where he learned to play the organ. Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19 . Adrian Partington, the cathedral's director of music, who examined all the manuscripts and chose the two pieces for the premiere, said: 'The pieces are beautifully well-written for his age and show a talented young composer, but they are not exceptional. I think he was writing stuff for his chums to perform at Eton and Oxford and he did it in a hurry. 'They were probably only performed informally around the piano and I suspect he just forgot about them, which is why they have been gathering dust for all these years. 'But the seeds of a great composition like Jerusalem can be found in this student work. These are beautifully shaped tunes, logical harmony and very exact but imaginative setting of the words.' Some are incomplete or jottings, but there are some important compositions which until recently were kept in storage by one of Parry's distant relatives. In later life, Parry went on to teach and later run the Royal College of Music in London, which has an archive of his work. Dr Peter Horton, a librarian at the college, said: 'The new documents are interesting because they are his early works and one can see from them how Parry's work developed.'

Neville Douglas Welsh, 65, was accused of deliberately leaving iced coffee bottles filled with methylated spirits, detergent, mineral turps and weed killer around Dean Park, in Townsville, north Queensland. A co-worker told the court he saw Welsh put a bottle down and wipe his fingerprints from it after leaving it by a vacant shopfront. But Welsh's defence barrister, Harvey Walters, claimed that Welsh ‘forgot’ to take the bottle away, the Townsville Bulletin reported. Neville Douglas Welsh, 65, has been found guilty of attempting to poison homeless people on the streets of Townsville, north Queensland (stock photo shown) Groups of homeless people were known to congregate in the city's Dean Park . The co-worker also told Townsville District Court, where a jury found Welsh guilty of attempting to injure by noxious substance, that Welsh said: ‘I should have put Ratsak and chillies in there to burn their guts.’ Other co-workers said Welsh left the bottles at shopfronts because from his experience working as a street cleaner he thought the homeless would ‘drink anything’. They said he was trying to get them to ‘p**s off’. Groups of homeless people were known to congregate in the city park. The former Townsville City Council worker will be sentenced in the same court on Wednesday. Neville Douglas Welsh worked for Townsville Council as a street cleaner . In August 2013, after Welsh’s first court hearing, Townsville Council CEO Ray Burton told the ABC the incident had distressed staff. ‘I have many staff who have contacted me through management and individually in terms of their shock and being appalled in respect to this matter," he said. ‘It's certainly not behaviour we condone among our staff.’ Mr Burton said as soon as the Council heard about the matter they conducted a sweep of the area to ensure there were no drinking bottles or containers near Dean Park.

'But of course we are a camera shop and photographers like to have good things to photograph, so I wanted to have some models here as well to pose for them.

Article text: Chelsea Handler had an in-person meeting with Bill Cosby where she believed she narrowly avoided being victimized. Speaking with Esquire magazine alongside Nick Offerman, the comedian and author described being freaked out by an invitation to Cosby's hotel suite and bringing three male friends for support. 'I was in Atlantic City playing, doing stand-up,' Handler said. 'And he was doing stand-up in Atlantic City in the same hotel.' A near Cosby: Speaking with Esquire magazine, Chelsea Handler described being invited to Cosby's hotel suite and bringing three male friends . 'At like three o’clock in the afternoon, someone from the hotel came down and said, "Oh, you know, Mr. Cosby would really like to meet you up in his hotel suite."' 'I thought, "That’s really weird,"' she continued. 'I don't want to go alone.' Handler says that three guys who were with her on the trip filming accompanied her up to Cosby's suite and the meeting passed without incident. The story followed a comment by writer Scott Raab expressing sympathy for the comedian who has faced a long line of women alleging he drugged and sexually assaulted them. 'Not poor guy—he tried to Cosby me,' Handler exclaimed. She claimed even after stories of decades of assault came to light, she didn't put her own experience in that context until a friend reminded her. Accusations: Dozens of women have come forward with allegations, some old, some never uncovered, about being drugged and sexually assaulted by the famous comedian . Backup: Handler said she brought three friends because she felt uncomfortable, one of whom reminded her of the incident years later as accusations began pouring in . 'I forgot about it when all the stories about Bill Cosby came out,' Handler said. 'I didn’t even think of it.' 'Then my friend texted me the other day saying, “Do you remember that night we went up to, or that afternoon we went up to Bill Cosby’s and you were so freaked out you made us come with you?”' 'He said, "Hello! You could’ve been one of his victims if we weren’t there."' 'He’s guilty,' Handler concluded. 'I think it’s pretty obvious now.'

Article text: By the time referee Wayne Barnes blew the final whistle, large chunks of the world-record crowd had long since drifted away into the north London night. Such was Saracens’ dominance of a Harlequins team who have completely lost their way, even the dubious lure of a Mexican wave had lost its appeal for the ‘away’ fans. Those left inside did muster a roar when Billy Vunipola dotted down for a deserved try with two minutes remaining, but Quins had been so inept for large parts of this game that a five-try victory felt slightly hollow. Saracens' Chris Wyles (left) manages to go over the line despite a last ditch tackle from Marland Yarde (right) Saracens' Chris Hodgson (centre) releases the ball as Harlequins' Joe Marler (left) close him down . Pop singer Pixie Lott performs at half-time in front of the record breaking 84,068 crowd at Wembley Stadium . The 24-year-old performs for the Saracens and Harlequins supporters during the Aviva premiership match . Saracens won’t care a jot. They were tack sharp for much of the game, physical and confrontational when they needed to be with a pack more than willing to mix it and a back line full of invention. It was just a shame the 84,068 crowd, many of them no doubt watching their first game of professional rugby, witnessed such a no-contest. Saracens have won all but one of their last 14 matches against their London rivals and on this evidence it will be a long time before they are troubled again. Quins, eighth in the Aviva Premiership table and with next to no chance of European qualification, really were that bad. Their returning England contingent of Chris Robshaw, Joe Marler and Nick Easter were unable to make any notable impact up front, while behind the scrum they were devoid of ideas. The world record breaking 84,068 attendance for a club rugby match is revealed on the Wembley scoreboard . Harlequins' Danny Care chips the ball forward during his side's 42-14 defeat by Saracens at Wembley . Saracens' Wyles and Harlequins' Ross Chisholm both try to catch the high ball during the premiership match . They missed the cutting edge of their concussed full back Mike Brown and scrum-half Danny Care is badly short of confidence after being dropped by England last autumn. The same cannot be said of Saracens, who consolidated their second spot in the table with a bonus-point win that saw winger Chris Ashton score an excellent brace. USA centre Chris Wyles excelled at 12 alongside the equally impressive Marcelo Bosch. With Owen Farrell, Brad Barritt and Schalk Brits set to return from injury soon, Saracens appear to be coming good at the right time. ‘The second 20 minutes of the first half was as good as we’ve been all season,’ said Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘We counter attacked really well and looked dangerous on the ball. We went off the boil in the next 20 minutes but put a lot of pressure on towards the end.’ Saracens' Billy Vunipola (right) recovers the ball and dives over the line to score his team's fifth and final try . Wyles (left) scored two tries in Saracens stunning 42-14 victory over Harlequins at Wembley on Saturday . Harlequins' Care (centre) breaks free of a late tackle from Saracens' Neil de Kock (bottom) on Saturday . The only blot on Ashton’s copybook was the yellow card shown for a tip tackle on Matt Hopper with eight minutes to play. No matter. Saracens still scored two tries with the wing off the field. ‘It’s incredibly frustrating,’ said Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea. ‘We’re just too easy to knock off. It’s been a really difficult couple of months. You can see that by how easily we get knocked off our stride, mentally. When you are used to success it hurts even more.’ It could all have been so different for Quins. On the same Wembley pitch where Harry Kane had taken just 78 seconds to open his international account for England the night before, young Quins flanker Jack Clifford dotted down 28 seconds into this contest after charging down Neil de Kock’s clearance. It proved to be as good as it would get for Quins as Wyles and Ashton scored superbly worked first-half tries. Quins lost prop Kyle Sinckler with a knee injury sustained courtesy of a dubious tackle by flanker Jacques Burger. Ashton’s 52nd-minute try put Saracens out of sight before the two more late tries put deserved gloss on the score. They will travel to face Racing Metro in the last eight of Europe next Sunday full of belief.

Article text: A garbage collector outside Atlanta has been sentenced to 30 days in prison for starting his work too early. Kevin McGill, 48, who works for Waste Management Inc, took a guilty plea deal after violating an ordinance in Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta, that bans collections before 7am. He turned 48 on Friday, but reported to a local jail at 6pm after being allowed to serve his time on the weekends so he can still work collecting wealthy residents' trash so he can support his wife and two children. The bin collector didn't have a lawyer when he was sentenced and has filed a motion to withdraw his plea, McGill's new attorney Kimberly Bandoh told Daily Mail Online. Kevin McGill, 48, will serve 30 days in jail  after pleading guilty to picking up trash in Sandy Springs, Georgia, before 7am . However, the Court Chief Solicitor Bill Riley asked for a 30 day sentence for the offense of picking up trash around 5am in the suburb and the judge granted the stiff penalty. He was sentenced on February 20th at the local courthouse, the running of which has been handed over to private contractors by the city. There were no real negotiations between her client and Mr Riley when he was sentenced, Ms Bandoh told Daily Mail Online, adding that the solicitor had claimed the offense meant 'automatic jail time'. Mr Riley has stood by the request for jail and says that 'fines don't seem to work' and 'The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail.' The solicitor said that residents of Sandy Springs, which include business executives for Delta Air Lines and other major companies, begin calling 9-1-1 when they hear early garbage men, according to WSPA. He said it was the right decision to punish McGill, who had only been on the route for three months, rather than his company, which the city has contracted to pick up its residents' trash. Sandy Springs solicitor Bill Riley said that it was the right decision to punish McGill, rather than his company, Waste Management . McGill is now working with lawyer Kimberly Bandon (pictured) and has filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea . The prosecutor said that early garbage collections are a nuisance to residents who want to sleep and that his office had met with Waste Management after previously punishing its employees for violating the ordinance. A representative for the company went to the courthouse with McGill, who expected to be ordered to pay up to a $1000 fine, Ms Bandoh said. Marla Prince, a spokesperson for for the company, told DailyMail Online that 'The incident with WM employee Kevin McGill is very unfortunate and we are currently working with WM Legal Counsel to resolve the situation'. She said she had not heard of a driver going to jail for a similar incident in the firm's South Atlantic area of Georgia and the Carolinas. Ms Prince added that Waste Management, which operates throughout the US and reported $14billion in revenue in 2014, would coordinate with its employee about his work schedule and jail time. Sharon Kraun, a spokesman for Sandy Springs, told Daily Mail Online that McGill's citation stemmed from an incident where his truck had been photographed by a resident. The city had seen a previous case where a garbage man was given jail time several years ago and that while no similar cases had happened since, the collectors had 'fair warning', Ms Kraun said. She said that Waste Management, which had amassed thousands of dollars in fines with the municipality in the last year, suspended McGill for violating its policies before he went to court. Waste Management could not answer questions about McGill's employment history with the company as of Saturday morning and said it was 'currently still investigating all the facts in the case'. Sandy Springs, a suburb that has seen residents such as business executives, Herman Cain and Akon, has contracted out most of its services, including the court system . His lawyer questioned the practice of going after  trash collectors personally. 'He's the employee. He's not the employer. Sentencing him to jail is doing what?' Ms Bandoh said. 'This is the most excessive punishment for an ordinance of this nature I've ever seen,' she said. McGill had never been to jail or even appeared in the court system, and no other charges factored into the judge's decision to give him jail time. He began serving his sentence last weekend for the February 5th citation and will continue losing his free time into the summer. Ms Bandoh said that the sentence was originally for 30 straight days before someone in the court spoke up and said that McGill should continue working and collecting the suburb's trash. 'I just want this to be over with,' McGill said, adding that he finds it hard to sleep in his hot jail cell. The worker was also sentenced to six months of probation, when he will pay fees to Sandy Springs, according to Vice. The suburb has privatized almost all of its city services, including its municipal courts, its communications, parks, economic development and call center operations. Its website states that 'this business model fosters a proactive, responsive and efficient approach to providing city services.' Residents of the area include professional athletes and rapper Akon, according to the New York Times.

Article text: The Homeland Security Department is investigating two senior Secret Service agents accused of crashing a car into a White House security barrier. Mark Connolly, the second-in-command on President Barack Obama's security detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior supervisor in the Washington field office, reportedly drove a government car into the barricades after drinking at a late-night retirement party last week. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said recently appointed Director Joseph Clancy has been briefed on the March 4 incident and that Clancy has asked the Homeland Security Department's Inspector General's Office to investigate the incident. Officers on duty who witnessed the incident reportedly tried to arrest the agents and conduct a sobriety test, but a supervisor said to let the men go home. President Obama is aware of the incident and the investigation. Scroll down for video . An investigation has been launched to see if two Secret Service agents, including Mark Connolly (above), the second-in-command on President Obama's security detail, drove their car into a White House barricade . This after the men had reportedly been drinking at a late-night retirement party for Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan (above) The agency said the two agents have been reassigned to non-supervisory, non-operational jobs. The Washington Post reports that the men had been at a bar to celebrate the retirement of departing Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. Connolly and Ogilvie have declined to comment, though it is believed that the incident was likely caught on Secret Service video, which feeds to the agency's command center. According to witnesses, the two men had their flashing lights on and were showing their badges as they tried to get through a section of the grounds that had been closed as a suspicious package was being investigated at around 10:30pm. It was then that they struck the barricade, after also driving through some security tape. It is illegal to use the flashing lights on a government vehicle without a security reason, or to drive a vehicle after consuming any alcohol. In 2013 a civilian who crashed into a barricade at the White House was chased by police and shot and killed. 'The Secret Service is aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees at the White House complex,' said Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary, a spokesman for the Secret Service. 'If misconduct is identified, appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations.' Also commenting on the situation were House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and member Elijah Cummings of Maryland who said in a statement; 'The fact that this event involved senior-level agents is not only embarrassing but exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation. 'The Committee as a whole remains committed to restoring the integrity of this elite agency and improving accountability at all staff levels.' The crash investigation is the latest embarrassment for the agency tasked with protecting the president. In the last six months, several top agency officials, including former Director Julian Pierson, have been forced out amid revelations of multiple, serious presidential security breaches. In September, a Texas man armed with a knife was able to climb a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being apprehended. An internal investigation and an outside panel report both described serious problems within the agency. A four-member panel of former senior government officials concluded in a report released last year that the agency was too insular and starving for leadership. The panel recommended an agency outsider to replace Pierson, but Obama earlier this year tapped Clancy, a retired agent who led the agency on an interim basis after Pierson's ouster. January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.

Article text: A land, air and sea search was launched by police on Friday after a young surfer reported pulling up the body of a man while in the ocean. The 16-year-old was surfing at Palm Beach at the Gold Coast in Queensland with friends at about 6.30am when he was thrown off his board and found himself tugging up a person's body as he surfaced. 'A 16-year-old boy was surfing with friends, he caught a wave and as he's come up and he's touched something which felt like hair,' A spokesperson for Queensland police told Daily Mail Australia. The 16-year-old surfer told police he had fallen off his board and upon resurfacing, felt something in the water that felt like hair. Upon tugging up the object out of the water, he said he realised it was a man's body . 'He then grabbed at the item and when he pulled up the item he saw the face of someone at which point he panicked, let go of the body and returned to shore. 'He later returned to the water with a friend to try and find the body but they couldn't locate it and contacted police around 8.30 this morning.' Gold Coast Water Police Senior Sergeant Gavin Peachey told the Brisbane Times: 'That's what he [the surfer] believes - there's nothing to confirm that at the moment.' Police immediately launched a search of the area using boats, jet skis and a helicopter; however they have received no reports of a missing person in the area. Abandoned items of clothing were found on the beach, including a Maktec by Makita hat and a white Volcan t-shirt, however they have since been claimed by a member of the public and have been deemed unrelated to the incident. Police responded by launching an land, air and sea search at Palm Beach (pictured) at the Gold Coast in Queensland on Friday, where investigations are still continuing . While the land and air search is continuing into Friday night, the water search has now been suspended. 'Police will reassess tomorrow morning if they will continue the search, they'll probably wait to see if they get reports of anyone missing. So far there are no reports to suggest someone is missing,' the spokesperson said. A statement from Queensland police urged 'anyone who may know of any person who may not have returned home from a morning swim in the Palm Beach area to please make contact with police'. The body was described as being a man in his 20's with dark hair. Anyone with information which could assist with the matter should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or visit crimestoppers.com.au.

Article text: Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao is the fight which just keeps on giving. Especially to Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. The initial projection of a purse split of $150million to the Money man and $100m to the PacMan has just been upwardly revised by Pacquiao's promoter. Bob Arum is now predicting a '$300m distribution' to the protagonists - $180m to Mayweather and $120m to Pacquiao under their 60-40 percent agreement. Floyd Mayweather could earn $180m from his May 2 fight with Manny Pacquiao given the huge public interest . Pacquiao will receive 40 per cent of the purse, which could hit $120m on projected record pay-per-view buys . Mayweather laughs while watching the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Boston Celtics . Those figures are based on Arum's firm expectation that this, the richest fight of all time, will not just break the pay-per-view record in America – but double it. He says: 'We are looking at four to five million buys. The interest is amazing, even from people who do not follow boxing, even people who don't follow any sports. 'Wherever you go everyone is talking about this fight.' They are also bending his ear for tickets in the 16,000-capacity MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2. Arum has already told a host of A-list celebrities: 'No comps this time. The demand is so huge that the only answer is everyone has to pay.' The only free ticket promised by Arum is for female UFC star Ronda Rousey, who he heard was preparing to spend all her career fight winnings thus far on a seat as close to ringside as that amount could buy. Promoter Bob Arum believes there will be between 'four and five million buys' of the fight on May 2 . Arum has only promised one free ticket to the Las Vegas showdown - to UFC star Ronda Rousey . Pacquiao, pictured working out in Minila, has already started preparing for his fight with Mayweather . Tickets are expected to be priced from the lowest at $1,250 to upwards of $6,000 for a seat at ringside. But it is unlikely any at all will go on general sale. Purchases may well be restricted to those holding a $250,000 credit line, or higher, at the MGM group of casinos on the Strip. Although there will of course be a thriving black market at eye-watering prices. Speaking at an ESPN fights night in New York state, Arum said: 'One guy offered me a hundred grand for a ticket.' Then he joked: 'I told him he could have my seat for $200,000.' The double-up factor will begin with the Grand Garden taking $40m at the box office, compared with the previous high-mark of $20m for Mayweather v Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in September 2013. But it is the pay-per-view TV sales – with rival networks HBO and Showtime sharing the broadcast – which will generate most of the revenue. The record number of buys stands at 2.4m for Mayweather v Oscar De La Hoya eight years ago. Oscar De La Hoya's fight with Mayweather in 2007 holds the record for the most pay-per-view buys at 2.4m . Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau in November last year . Mayweather's last fight came when he beat Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas in September 2014 . Naturally the charge has risen substantially since then, probably to $99.95 per subscription. Thus Arum's five million buys – along with such ancillary income as TV rights overseas, including Britain - would make this 'The Half-Billion Dollar Fight'. That would generate $200m to be shared among the likes of the local broadcasting stations, the MGM hosts, the promoters, the undercard fighters and so on. As for the $300m to the two best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, Arum says: 'Floyd loves cars and he could buy so many as to satisfy very dealer in Las Vegas. A lot of Manny's money is going to charity in the Philippines.' Each to his own – and the Las Vegas sports books are bracing themselves for seven-figure bets on Mayweather, the favourite, and Pacquiao, the under-dog.

Ground truth Summary: Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will meet in Las Vegas on May 2 .

Article text: New York City have signed Manchester City goalkeeper Eirik Johansen on a permanent deal after impressing during pre-season. The 22-year-old is a product of the Premier League champions' academy - having joined in August 2008 before signing a professional contract at the Etihad Stadium in 2012. Johansen, a Norway Under 21 international, came on as a second half substitute in two matches for New York City during pre-season - first against Brondby and then in a Carolina Challenge Cup clash against Houston Dynamo. New York City announced the signing of Manchester City goalkeeper Eirik Johansen on Tuesday . 'I had a great experience working with squad and coaches during the pre-season and I'm excited to re-join the team on permanent basis,' Johansen told the New York City's official website on Tuesday. 'The quality of the training really impressed me, as did the way the team came together in such a short period of time.' New York head coach Jason Kreis believes the signing of Johansen merely strengthens their options in the goalkeeping department. The 22-year-old (pictured in 2011) joins the MLS outfit after impressing during their pre-season . 'We had a good look at Eirik over the course of the pre-season, and he adapted well to the team and to our style of play,' he added. 'It's always good to have strong competition for places in the team, and Eirik will add to an already strong group of goalkeepers vying for game time. 'It's a long season and guys will get their opportunities for various reasons.' Johansen will be linking up with Frank Lampard once more when the latter's loan at Manchester City expires this season. The former England international has been using the international break to admire the scenery of New York as he prepares for his highly anticipated move to the city's football team and Major League Soccer on July 1. The attacking midfielder will join up with New York City after the Premier League season finishes and he has been taking time to get used to his new home city while the club season pauses for Euro 2016 qualifiers and international friendlies. On Monday, the 36-year-old uploaded a picture to his Facebook account posing with the city providing a spectacular backdrop after going for a jog alongside fiancee Christine Bleakley.

Article text: A bridesmaid hanged herself just hours after her sister's wedding, an inquest has heard. Rebecca Darnell, 30, was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress when she was found dead at her home in Addlestone, Surrey  after the ceremony in November last year. Ms Darnell, known to her family as 'Boo', was described as having been 'the life and soul of the party' at her older sister, Joanna's, wedding. But the coroner was told she had a row with her partner of four years, Carlo Salamone, in a taxi on the way home from the party. Mr Salamone told the inquest he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell to marry her this summer. Rebecca Darnell (right) hanged herself hours after her sister Jo's (second right) wedding . Mr Salamone slept on the sofa when they got home and later went upstairs to find her dead, the inquest heard. She was still wearing her bridesmaid's dress and jewellery from the night before. Her family members told of their shock, having seen Ms Darnell enjoying herself only hours earlier at the wedding in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father David told the coroner: 'She was the life and soul. She got everybody up and dancing, which is no mean feat. She was getting everyone involved.' Her aunt, Jacqueline Nash, said Rebecca was a 'happy, bubbly' person, who had recently organised her sister's Joanna's hen party and was excited to see her get married to fiancé Matt Wilson. 'She was always fun to be around so you always tried to see Boo when you could,' she said. 'She had a real zest for life and everyone wanted to know her.' Toxicology tests taken after her death showed she was double the drink driving limit, with 162mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. Mr Salamone said his partner had been 'very happy' on the day of the wedding, on November 8 2013, and, although she had drunk vodka and cola, had not seemed excessively drunk. Taxi driver Khalik Meah said the couple had been arguing when he gave them a lift back from the party some time after midnight. Asked whether the couple rowed a lot, Mr Salamone said they would argue when they were drunk, but this was only around once a month and this had been no worse than normal. Mr Salamone told the inquest in Woking, Surrey that he had met Ms Darnell in around 2010 through a close friend who worked with her at Alpha Hospital in Woking, Surrey. Ms Darnell (right) pictured in the bridesmaid's dress in which she was found dead after her sister's wedding last November . Carlo Salamone (pictured with his sister Mirella Newman-Bale, who also gave evidence at today's hearing) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask Ms Darnell, his partner of four years, to marry him this summer . She was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a Masters degree in family therapy. 'She was my life partner,' the garage owner said. 'That evening at the wedding I had spoken to Jo's husband and arranged the following summer in Dubai [where the newlyweds lived] to ask Rebecca to marry me. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.' However, he added: 'Rebecca was very good at making everyone feel better. She often had this iron curtain around her. She would never show people her feelings.' The counsellor had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was aged 25 years, the coroner heard, leaving her reliant on insulin to regulate her blood sugar levels. Her medication had made her put on weight, which Mr Salamone said she worried about, weighing herself every morning and evening. Once, during a severe hypoglycaemic attack, she fell into a coma which lasted four days and left her with minor memory problems. Her father David said his daughter, who grew up in Hertford before the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, had been a perfectionist. He said: 'She set herself high standards, she had aspirations. She wanted to succeed and as a family I think we are all very determined and she had those attributes.' She had found her diabetes diagnoses 'difficult,' he said, coming quite late in her life, but insisted she had it 'all in hand.' 'We're not really sure that she did totally,' he added. Ms Darnell (pictured, third from right) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Jo and her husband Matt Wilson. Family had described her as the 'life and soul of the party' at the event . Earlier last year, Ms Darnell organised her sister's hen party. Family said they could not explain her actions . Mr Salamone's sister Mirella Newman-Bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening, when confided her worries about work and study. The pair made plans to see each other the next day to talk about things. Rebecca's cousin Samantha Nash, aged 24 years, said she had seen Ms Darnell in a state at about 10pm on the night of the wedding. Miss Nash said she made plans to see her cousin the following week for dinner to catch up properly and fetched her mother to check on her. However, the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over, the inquest heard. The coroner heard that Ms Darnell started working at Visions, a young person's drug and alcohol service in Hounslow, London, in 2011. Records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team, providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems. Her line manager Luke Hedge said Rebecca had been a 'natural giver and supporter of others.' Offering his sympathies to her parents and partner, coroner Richard Travers said Rebecca had been a 'remarkable force.' 'It is really apparent to me that she was a remarkable force with an exceptional ability to engage with young people,' he said. 'I have absolutely no doubt that she will be a great loss to that line of work. 'On a personal note she was diagnosed with diabetes in 2006, which it seems, was something that sat very heavily with her and which she never came to terms with. 'It is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner, family, work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in Boo's intentions on the day she died. 'On the 8th of November 2013 Boo's sister was married. Boo had played a major role in planning the hen do, which albeit stressful, seems to have gone very well. 'I heard that during the course of the wedding in the main Boo was her usual bubbly, lively self and that she, as her father told me, had been the 'life and soul of the party.' 'It is also right that at other times she had been very emotional. Clearly she did have things on her mind. How much her emotional outbursts were affected by alcohol, I do not know.' He ruled out a verdict of suicide, as he could not find any clear intention, such as leaving a suicide note and Rebecca had made plans to see friends and family for the coming days. 'Consequently I conclude Rebecca died from self-inflicted injuries but her intention was unclear,' he said.

Article text: A number of England’s Ashes cricket stars are facing ‘very substantial’ bills from the tax man after investing in film funds, it has been reported. International players including some members of the Ashes-winning team of 2005 are said to have been among those who invested in partnerships set up by Ingenious Media. HM Revenue & Customs is reported to have sent demands to Michael Vaughan, Paul Collingwood, Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles – all of whom took part in the landmark triumph over Australia. HM Revenue & Customs is reported to have sent demands to Michael Vaughan (left) and Paul Collingwood (right) According to the Guardian, the four players invested in Ingenious Film Partners in February and March 2005 - just months before England secured its first Ashes victory in 18 years. HMRC is currently locked in a legal battle with Ingenious Media, which set up the partnerships, claiming the investments were a means of avoiding tax. The company has previously denied the claims, saying HMRC approved its schemes at the time and that the investments were made in box office hits including Avatar and Hotel Rwanda. The Guardian reports that former England captain Michael Vaughan invested in three of the partnerships being challenged by HMRC – Ingenious Film Partners 2, Ingenious Film Partners and Inside Track Productions. Ashes heroes Matthew Hoggard (left) and Ashley Giles (right) are also reported to have been sent demands by the taxman . Sky Sports presenter and former Ashes winner David Gower (left) is also on the list of investors along with former International batsmen Alec Stewart (right) Sky Sports presenter and former Ashes winner David Gower is also on the list of investors along with former International batsmen Alec Stewart and Mark Butcher. The list of investors is publicly registered at Companies House. The managing director of Arundel Wealth, Jon Alexander, was brought in by the Professional Cricketers’ Association to provide assistance for the players affected. The Guardian quotes him as saying that some are facing ‘very substantial demands’. Apart from David Gower, the former cricketers contacted by the newspaper declined to discuss the matter publicly – although one spoke anonymously to say the demand could place him in ‘financial difficulty’. David Gower is quoted as saying that the money involved ‘won’t wipe me out.’ Ashes heroes: Michael Vaughan (right) was captain as England won the Ashes in 2005 while Matthew Hoggard (left) was a key wicket-taker . But he added: ‘But the principle is just wrong and I want to stand up against it. The government wanted to encourage investment in the film industry, there was a genuine element of risk. ‘The films were successful and generated more than £1bn in taxable income and now HMRC is coming back ten years later saying the schemes weren’t valid.’ Ingenious has repeatedly defended the schemes it set up and has said  it is confident of winning the legal battle. A spokesman is quoted in the Guardian as saying that its partnerships were either 'sale and leaseback partnerships’ established under government legislation or were ‘bona fide commercial partnerships operated for profit’. The case comes as HMRC stepped up its crackdown on tax-avoidance schemes in a bid to claw back £7.1billion from 43,000 people.

Article text: For many disastrous cooks, boiling an egg is the one task in the kitchen that they can actually master. However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand. The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. The downside? At £1.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg. Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon . Marketed as the Yowk - 'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the 'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with. The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg. And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven . Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk . Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water. New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013. He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy. 'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.' The product is to be unveiled at the International Food Event trade show later this month before aiming to be listed in supermarkets and possibly food and drink outlets in May. A coffee chain has already expressed interest in selling it, along with some retailers, Hetherington told The Grocer.

Ground truth Summary: The Yowk pre-cooked egg simply needs reheating for five minutes to achieve the perfect yolk, say the makers .
Packs will retail at £1.79 each and come complete with an egg cup, spoon, soldier-style breadsticks and salt .
The product looks likely to hit supermarket shelves in May .

Article text: Jordan Henderson required a slice of luck  after an uninspiring first half against Swansea, Jordi Amat’s sliding tackle sending the ball ricocheting on to his shin and ultimately looping beyond the reach of Lukasz Fabianski. But there has been nothing fortuitous about the manner of his improvement over the past two years. He has blossomed from a player talked about in the same breath as Andy Carroll and Charlie Adam  - as examples of how Liverpool wasted the money from the sale of Fernando Torres - to England’s best midfielder. Liverpool have not lost any of the 15 games where their vice-captain has worn the armband this season, winning 12 and drawing three, proving himself in the dressing room and on the pitch a worthy successor to the departing Steven Gerrard. Jordan Henderson celebrates scoring against Swansea, the latest high point in his huge improvement . Henderson was almost sold to Fulham by Brendan Rodgers but is now England's best midfield option . The former Sunderland man was spoken about as a waste of money but is Steven Gerrard's successor now . An incredible unbeaten run in the league stretching back to December has put Liverpool just two points behind Manchester United in fourth and Henderson has been the key to their revival. Even when he is not playing well, as was the case against Swansea, the 24-year-old is a hub of industry, harrying the opposition and straining every sinew and devoting every ounce of energy to the cause. He also keeps popping up at the crucial moments - this was his third goal in as many games and a vital one which keeps the momentum going for his side. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher speaks of him as one of the best midfielders in the Barclays Premier League. Not bad for a bloke from Wearside who runs funny. Henderson was not even playing particularly well against Swansea but he made the difference for Liverpool . Liverpool have not lost any of the 15 games played by Henderson as captain in Gerrard's absence . Legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson turned down the opportunity to sign Henderson . That was the assessment of none other than Sir Alex Ferguson, who wrote in his autobiography that Steve Bruce, then Henderson’s manager at Sunderland, recommended United sign the youngster. Ferguson declined citing Henderson’s gait ‘might cause him injuries later in his career'. Of course now he is just the sort of player Manchester United would want marshalling their midfield when the sides meet on Sunday in what could transpire to be pivotal in the race for the final Champions League spot. Henderson laughed off Ferguson’s mean observation, even taking it as a compliment that the pair were discussing him. Over his career so far, he has demonstrated an enviable resilience and a thick skin. When he first arrived at Anfield for £16million and failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown for boyhood club Sunderland he was widely, and understandably, maligned. Even Brendan Rodgers wanted to sell him to Fulham at one point. When he first arrived at Anfield, Henderson failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown at Sunderland . Ferguson turned down Henderson while he was at Sunderland but Manchester United could do with him now . Rodgers considered selling Henderson to Fulham but has been won round by the player's ambition . But Henderson won the Northern Irishman round with his desire and ambition and the two have struck up a good relationship. Henderson credits Rodgers' insistence that he work on his tactical nouse with his improvement. Gary Neville, who works closely with Henderson in the England set-up, has observed a big change in him in the last 12 months and praised his fanatical approach to working on set-pieces. ‘He has a massive conscience in terms of caring about his game and practising on the training ground,’ Neville said on Sky’s Monday Night Football. ‘I remember last year seeing a big change in him in terms of training and practising free-kicks and set pieces. Henderson poses with Charlie Adam, Kenny Dalglish, Alexander Doni and Stewart Downing (left to right) upon signing but in his early days at the club he was viewed as an example of Liverpool wasting money . Henderson is a leader in the dressing room at Liverpool, and with England, according to Gary Neville . The midfielder accepts the congratulations of his team-mates after a hard-fought win in Wales on Monday . ‘You saw him taking set-pieces with Steven Gerrard in the middle. Who would have thought that would happen two years ago? He is not frightened to pull people out and talk, that is why he has the captain’s armband. He is one of the leaders in the dressing room at Liverpool and he is the same with England.’ There may have been moments of luck along the way for Henderson but his story is one of perseverance and boundless improvement. Liverpool and England will hope there is even more to come. Henderson initially struggled to meet expectations at Liverpool but is now valuable  for club and country . Jordi Amat slides in to clear for Swansea but the clearance rebounded off Henderson and into the net .

Article text: Ryan Lockyer, 22, (pictured) was jailed for six years for the 'terrifying' attack, which left his 31-year-old victim afraid to go out . A woman was forced to jump into a canal to escape a dangerous serial sex attacker who threatened to kill her - but he will not serve a day for the crime. Ryan Lockyer, 22, of  Reading, Berkshire, was jailed for six years for the 'terrifying' attack, which left his 31-year-old victim afraid to go out alone. Reading Crown Court heard the incident took place less than 18 months after Lockyer was released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks. Lockyer stalked his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, as she walked home from work on October 7, 2014. As she passed through a nature reserve near Fobney Lock in Reading, Berkshire, at around 3.45pm, the defendant began following her. When she noticed him he started to run towards her shouting: 'I have a knife and I will kill you.' Prosecutor Walton Hornsby said Lockyer, who was brandishing a 10cms long knife, grabbed the woman and told her: 'I will kill you if you don't do what I want you to do.' Mr Hornsby said: 'She thought the only way to get away from him was to jump in the river.' The woman then told Lockyer she would do whatever he wanted, which appeared to take him by surprise and gave her the chance to slip free from his grasp and jump into the canal. Lockyer immediately ran off but the victim remained in the water for some time, scared he was still in the area. The victim eventually returned home and reported the incident to police the following day, describing her attacker as looking like an actor from BBC drama The Tudors. Lockyer was arrested after being picked out of an identity parade on October 10 and he was charged the next day. He gave a no comment during his interview but at a court hearing on January 7 he admitted a charge of making threats to kill, committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and threatening with a bladed article. Reading Crown Court (pictured) heard Lockyer carried out the attack less than 18 months after being released early from prison for an earlier series of sex attacks . In a victim impact statement the woman described how she now takes the bus everywhere rather than walking alone and sees a potential attacker in every man she encounters. After his arrest Lockyer was recalled to prison to serve the rest of his previous licence period. That sentence related to a hearing at Oxford Crown Court in 2011 when, aged 18 years, Lockyer was jailed for four years with a three-year licence for sexual assault, three counts of sexual activity with a child and causing actual bodily harm. 'This was, without question, a terrifying experience for your victim,' Judge John told Lockyer, who appeared via video link from HMP Bullingdon. The judge then blasted Parliament for laws which meant he could not jail Lockyer for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks, meaning he will 'literally not serve a day' behind bars for the latest offence. The judge blasted Parliament for laws which meant he could not jail the 22-year-old for longer than his prison recall for the previous sex attacks . 'That is a consequence which, I feel bound to say, I deplore but about which I can do nothing,' Judge Stephen John told Lockyer as he sentenced him via video link at Reading Crown Court. Judge Stephen John described Lockyer as 'one of the more dangerous men' he had come across during his lengthy career, saying it was a 'chilling' case. Judge John said the defendant had an 'alarming' history and said he was plainly a danger to the public. However, the judge said that because of laws introduced in 2003 and the fact that Lockyer would be released halfway through his latest sentence, he would effectively not serve a day behind bars for the canal attack. 'Apart from the effect of your recall, you will be entitled to release from the sentence I now impose at the halfway point, thus three years from today, which would be March 9, 2018,' said Judge John. 'Because of the licence recall, you will not be released until May 13, 2018, a mere seven weeks later. 'Because Parliament in its wisdom chose in 2003 to abolish the power to return a prisoner to custody to serve the unexpired portion of licence and then to order the fresh sentence to run consecutively to that recall, the effect of my order is that you will literally not serve a day longer for the offences for which you are now sentenced.' When he is released, Lockyer will remain on licence for 10 years. In mitigation, Peter De Feu said: 'As far as this offending goes and this very brave victim, he is sorry. 'He is still young and young enough perhaps for there to be a hope of change.' Lockyer was jailed for six years for making threats to kill and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence. He will serve a two year sentence for threatening with a bladed article concurrently. He was also handed an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order, having already been given a 10-year order in 2011.

Article text: A group of British tourists taking part in a sunset cruise along the Zambezi River were left horrified after seeing crocodiles eat a man, it has been reported. The tour group and their guide were making their way down the river between Zimbabwe and Zambia when they saw crocodiles feeding. But as they approached, it became clear that the reptiles were tearing apart the bottom half of a human. Horrified British tourists saw crocodiles eating a man on the banks of the Zambezi River between Zambia and Zimbabwe (file picture) The Daily Telegraph reports that the tourists alerted authorities - but by the time officials had arrived to investigate, the remains of the body had vanished. It quotes a local source as saying: 'All there was to see of him was his trousers. We have had no information about anyone missing from villages around us, so we don't think the man was a local.' Trevor Lane of Zimbabwean conservation group, the Bhejane Trust, said the body was believed to have been a Zambian man. He is thought to have been among a group of 13 suspected poachers ambushed by park rangers in Zimbabwe just days earlier. Mr Lane suggested that one of the poachers was killed in a clash between the two groups and that only nine men made it back over the river to Zambia. When the tourists approached the crocodiles they could see that the reptiles were eating the bottom half of a human (file picture) He reportedly told the South African Press Association: 'We strongly suspect it was a poacher. 'Maybe he was wounded and tried to swim across the river.' The Telegraph Mr Lane as saying there was a 'shoot out' involving the poachers and the rangers and that he suspected the man was 'already dead when the crocodile ate him.' It is the latest in a series of crocodile attacks in Zimbabwe and three children are reported to have been killed by them in the last three months. In one attack last month, a three-year-old girl was grabbed by a crocodile as she played on the banks of the river in the north of the country. A 16-year-old girl was attacked along the Runde River to the south on New Year's Day.

Article text: The husband of a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death by his best friend has described the moment he found his friend standing over his wife, holding a knife. Jonathan Broyhill  is accused of stabbing 29-year-old Jamie Hahn to death in her North Raleigh home in Carolina, and then turning the knife on his friend Nation Hahn as he tried to help his wife. Mr Hahn told a court in North Carolina that he ran down the stairs after he heard his wife scream, only to see Broyhill 'standing over her with a knife.' Widower Nation Hahn has described the moment he found his wife injured in their home, with his best friend Jonathan Broyhill, standing over her with a knife. He claims Broyhill slashed him as he tried to help her . The 33-year-old allegedly slashed Mr Hahn as he tried to help his wife, leaving him with minor injuries. He has been charged with first degree murder, attempted murder and felony assault. The court had previously heard that Jamie Hahn was a political strategist who worked for Sky Blue Strategies and employed Broyhill - best man to her husband at their wedding - to do accounting work, ABC news reported. Broyhill was in charge of campaign financing and providing reports to the Financial Elections Commission, but was accused of embezzling almost $50,000. The court heard that Mrs Hahn had started asking questions about the financial irregularities shortly before the attack. Mr Hahn said he did not think his wife knew about the alleged embezzling but said she was frustrated about the financial problems and concerned these had not been resolved. Broyhill had allegedly been avoiding speaking to her. Mr Hahn, a well-known strategist in North Carolina political circles, told the court that on 22 April 2013 he heard his wife scream and came running down the stairs. Jonathan Broyhill (left) is accused of murdering Jamie Hahn (right) and trying to murder her husband (far right) He said: 'I sort of rounded the corner of the stairs, and my eyes immediately went ... [to where] there was blood on the floor, and I could see Jamie's legs sticking out from behind.' Mr Hahn, 28, described seeing Broyhill in the kitchen standing over his wife with a knife and claims he slashed him as he went to try and console her. He said she had earlier shouted out his name and then Broyhill's and said: 'He's trying to kill me.' The couple were both taken to hospital but Mrs Hahn died two days later of her injuries.  She had been stabbed nearly a dozen times, leaving her with a severed artery and her liver severely lacerated, the News Observer reported. Mr Hahn described Broyhill as looking 'stone faced' during the attack - in sharp contrast to the smiling man who had given him a hug when he came through the door earlier. Mr Hahn told the court during his best man's trial that he came down the stairs when he heard his wife scream and saw Broyhill standing over her with a knife as she lay on the floor in the kitchen . Lawyers defending Broyhill said his mental state was unraveling in the run up to the attack, which saw him falsely claim he had pancreatic cancer and was suffering from MS. They admitted he had stabbed Hahn, but said he only meant to injure himself. Caroline Elliot, defending, said: 'Jon was determined to take his own life. 'He had no motive to kill those he loved. Something snapped.' Friends have previously told how the Hahns had asked the Reverend Nancy Petty to pray for Broyhill during his cancer struggle, according to members of the Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh. Facebook pictures show the trio were firm friends, having shared several holidays abroad together . Mr and Mrs Hahn graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and married in 2009, she was murdered four years later . He was also said to be a regular visitor to their home and had dinner with them every week. Facebook pictures show the three had a close relationship - enjoying watching sports games at home and traveling abroad to share holidays. Mr and Mrs Hahn graduated from UNC Chapel Hill and were married in 2009. Mr Hahn and Broyhill were believed to be close friends, having met during a church trip in 2000. Yesterday a Superior Court judge dismissed a juror from the trial who had been overheard talking about discussing the case with his wife. He rejected calls for a mistrial. The case continues.

Article text: A bride who shot her niece dead during an argument on her wedding night is claiming it was a drunken accident. Christina George-Harvan, 30 and Katelyn Francis, 21, were celebrating at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, after the ceremony on April 24, 2014 when they started arguing over who should drive home. The row spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car when the gun went off. Prosecutors say George-Harvan took the weapon from the center console and deliberately shot Francis, but her defense claims it fired by accident. She is facing third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges. Scroll down for video . Christina George-Harvan, 30 (pictured in court on Friday) has been accused of shooting her niece Katelyn Francis dead. She claims it was just a drunken accident . George-Harvan and Francis, 21, (pictured) were partying after a wedding 30 miles south of Pittsburgh on April 24, 2014 . George-Harvan, a former nurse, took to the stand on Thursday during her trial.  She told the court about the hours leading up the shooting - saying there was no tension with her niece. According to CBS Pittsburgh, she said: 'I was happy…she was so cute. We were only nine years apart. The first thing she did was say, 'Aunt Tina, I'm so happy for you,' and gave me a big hug.' As the night went on they drank more, the court heard, and soon Mr Harvan was determined to drive home. However Francis demanded she be the designated driver and tried to take the keys off of him. George-Harvan said: 'When I turned around, the glove box is open and I see this gun. I think I gotta move this gun. I go get it out of the glove box to move it and boom the gun goes off. The defense attorney then asked: 'Did you squeeze the trigger?' And she replied: 'No.' Recounting the moment she realized she had shot her niece, she said: 'Everything freezes, Jeremy says, 'You just shot your [expletive] cousin'. George-Harvan (pictured before her first court appearance the day after the shooting) said she would never hurt her niece and insists there was no tension between the pair earlier in the evening . The row had spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car (inside on night of shooting pictured) when the gun went off. George-Harvan claims it fired when she tried to move it . 'He steps over her dying body and he runs. I put pressure on [Katelyn's[ wound and I screamed and dialed 911. She added, 'I felt devastated. It was like a nightmare. Your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your life and my niece is dead.' The prosecution rested on Thursday. The defense called former Pennsylvania State Trooper Frederick Wentling as a ballistic experts. He told the court the weapon could discharge with just the slightest pressure on the trigger. According to CBS Pittsburgh, he said: 'If you put your thumb in… if you pick it up sideways, and put your thumb in there and pull it back, it will discharge. 'It's supposed to. It doesn't know what's pulling it to the rear.' On Friday Prosecutor Brittany Smith told the jury, 'She shot somebody. She killed somebody. Do you think she used reasonable care?' The jury is now deliberating and is considering third-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter. The defense argues the jury should acquit her of any homicide charge under the doctrine of 'excusable homicide by misadventure,'. The defendant has to have shown carelessness without criminal intent for that to be proven. George-Harvan, her new husband and Francis went out drinking to celebrate the marriage at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton and subsequently got into a fight over who would drive home .

Article text: A survivor of the Boston Marathon bombing has posted an open letter to bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on her Facebook page, just hours after testifying on the first day of the 21-year-old's trial. Rebekah Gregory, 27, from Houston, Texas, lost half of her left leg after 18 surgeries following the April 15, 2013 blast. She and her 5-year-old son, Noah, had been watching her boyfriend's mother compete in the race when the explosion occurred. Scroll down for video . Rebekah Gregory, pictured left in a courtroom sketch from Wednesday, who lost half of her left leg as a result of the bomb, wrote a lengthy Facebook post in which she said seeing Tsarnaev in court had helped her realize she isn't afraid anymore . On Wednesday night she wrote a lengthy post in which she said seeing Tsarnaev in court had helped her come to terms with what happened that fateful day. 'TODAY...I looked at you right in the face....and realized I wasn't afraid anymore,' Gregory wrote. 'And today I realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that I needed all along.' The emotional letter has been shared more than 2,500 times and received over 11,000 'likes' within hours of being posted. Earlier Ms Gregory had told the court that the last thing she remembered before the explosion was entertaining Noah who was bored watching the runners. She said that the force of the blast had thrown her backwards and immediately she began looking for her son - but realized she had bones sticking out of her legs and arms and flesh hanging from her body. 'My bones were lying next to me on the sidewalk,' Gregory recalled during her testimony in federal court in Boston. 'I felt that was the day I would die.' Ms Gregory's boyfriend Pete DiMartino, 30, was also present at the bombing and suffered a shattered ankle, a ruptured eardrum, and lost his right Achilles tendon in the blast . She told the court that she could hear Noah screaming 'mommy' and asked God to take her but not her son. Ms Gregory began to weep as she said that as she scanned for Noah, she saw the body of Krystle Campbell lying behind her. She recalled that an emergency responder told her she was going to be OK then yelled: 'We have an amputee!' Several jurors were close to tears as Ms Gregory told the court that she still has shrapnel in her body and each time a piece works its way to the surface, she will have an operation. Her son Noah suffered a shrapnel injury to his leg and head. Ms Gregory was shown a photo in court in which she was able to identify herself and her family with bomber, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, standing directly behind. Ms Gregory's boyfriend Pete DiMartino, 30, was also present and suffered a shattered ankle, a ruptured eardrum, and lost his right Achilles tendon in the blast. The couple announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage. Gregory and DiMartino announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage, left, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is on trail for his role in the marathon blast on April 15, 2013 . Despite getting married and staying together as Gregory had her leg amputated, the couple have decided to part ways citing irreparable strain, The People reported. Gregory, who struggled her way down the aisle after learning to walk again following the amputation, told The People: 'After the decision was made to amputate my leg in November, I found myself having to make an even more painful choice – to separate from my husband Pete. 'Over the last several months I've come to realize that going through such a horrific event together put a fast-forward on our relationship that we each handled differently. 'While my heart is beyond broken, I have a certain peace knowing from day one, I truly gave it my all, and have been fully invested in keeping this marriage, and my commitment before God. 'I still love Pete with all of my heart and ask that everyone respect our privacy as we try to figure out our next steps. 'As for now, I am focused on doing what I feel is best for my son and I, and will concentrate my time on healing, both physically and emotionally.' The couple had a fairytale wedding, documented on the season finale of TLC's popular reality show, Say Yes To The Dress. They wed in Asheville, North Carolina, in April last year then moved to Houston, Texas. Seeing Tsarnaev in court had helped her realize she isn't afraid of him anymore, wrote Rebekah Gregory . Dear Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, . My name is Rebekah Gregory. We don't really know each other and never will. But over the last two years, I have seen your face not only in pictures, but in almost every one of my nightmares. Moments before the first blast, your stupid backpack even brushed up against my arm, but I doubt you remember because I am no one to you. A complete stranger. And although I was merely just a blip on your radar, (someone that happened to be standing 3 feet from your designated 'good spot' for a bomb), you have been so much more to me. Because you have undoubtedly been my source of fear since April 15th, 2013. (After all, you are one of the men responsible for nearly taking my child, and for the permanent image embedded in my brain of watching someone die.) Up until now, I have been truly scared of you and because of this, fearful of everything else people might be capable of. But today, all that changed. Because this afternoon, I got to walk into a courtroom and take my place at the witness stand, just a few feet away from where you were sitting. (I was WALKING. Did you get that?) And today I explained all the horrific details, of how you changed my life, to the people that literally hold YOURS in their hands. That's a little scary right? And this afternoon before going in, I'm not going to lie..my palms were sweaty. And sitting up there talking to the prosecution did make me cry. But today, do you know what else happened? TODAY...I looked at you right in the face....and realized I wasn't afraid anymore. And today I realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that I needed all along. And I think that's the ironic thing that happens when someone intends something for evil. Because somehow, some way, it always ends up good. But you are a coward. A little boy who wouldn't even look me in the eyes to see that. Because you can't handle the fact that what you tried to destroy, you only made stronger. And if your eyes would've met mine for just one second, you would've also seen that what you 'blew up' really did BLOW UP. Because now you have given me (and the other survivors) a tremendous platform to help others, and essentially do our parts in changing the world for the better. So yes...you did take a part of me. Congratulations you now have a leg up...literally. But in so many ways, you saved my life. Because now, I am so much more appreciative of every new day I am given. And now, I get to hug my son even tighter than before, blessed that he is THRIVING, despite everything that has happened. So now...while you are sitting in solitary confinement, (awaiting the verdict on your life), I will be actually ENJOYING everything this beautiful world has to offer. And guess what else? I will do so without fear....of YOU. Because now to me you're a nobody, and it is official that you have lost. So man that really sucks for you bro. I truly hope it was worth it. Sincerely, . Someone you shouldn't have messed with . ‪#‎bostonstrong .

Article text: Hidden in a vault in Marrakesh, it has been one of the most highly-anticipated albums in music history. And tonight, after six years, the Wu-Tang Clan finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin - before sealing it away once more. In an attempt to break free from the Spotify and YouTube era of freely-shared music, rap's most influential collective is selling the 31-track double LP to one bidder for millions of dollars. After a private online-only sale this month through art dealers Paddle8 - which employs Britain's Princess Eugenie - the buyer cannot share the album for at least 88 years. DailyMail.com was there with the group's de facto leader RZA, producer Cilvaringz, a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in Queens, New York City, for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103. Scroll down for video . Unprecendented: This is the Wu-Tang Clan's record Once Upon A Time In Shaolin that was played on Monday night to a small group before it is sold and kept secret until the year 2103. It has been six years in the making . The record comes in a silver, jeweled box with a specially-designed wax seal and a leather-bound book . The box: It was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation . The Staten Island-born group revived the East Coast as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s . Confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance, Cher's voice bellowed out during the 13-minute extract. And though it wasn't played, DailyMail.com understands it to be true that Barcelona FC players also make a cameo appearance. Typical of the group's first record 36 Chambers, it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples, clips of dialogue from movies, and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder. Reiterating its own grandeur, there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say, 'this has never been done before.' All of the Staten Island clan's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts. The record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in Morocco, with a seal designed and printed by wax-smiths in Serbia. 'This has never been done before,' RZA told DailyMail.com after playing the record. 'Music is just handed out now, the industry is in crisis. People feel like they deserve to have it for free. This is art. You can take a picture of the Mona Lisa but that's not art. 'The same with this: you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing.' The pre-sale event played up to the idea. Those invited were subjected to airport-style security checks, and electronic devices were confiscated. In a dark room, buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played. The nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight, with two bodyguards standing either side. While some  were fans, others were advisers who hailed from as far as Asia to inspect the 'artwork'. One adviser for a Chinese collector, who wished to remain anonymous, told DailyMail.com collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like Wu-Tang or not. The box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining. Inside, is a cinematic-style record, plus a leather-bound 174-page manuscript printed on gilded Fedrigoni Marina parchment with lyrics, credits, tales about the recording. The adviser said: 'Someone said it would be worth $1 million. That's nothing. This is something completely different; completely new. I don't think I could put a price on it. 'The concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history... It is huge.' The Wu-Tang Clan formed in the early 1990s, reviving the East Coast's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop. RZA - pronounced 'rizza' - drew together nine MCs, including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms Ol' Dirty Bastard and GZA. The remaining slots were filled by Raekwon, Masta Killa, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Method Man, and Inspectah Deck. Ambition: RZA, né Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, wants the long-awaited album to be treated like a work of art . Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA (pictured) but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougar . The new album pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry . With industry domination in their sights, RZA saw that each member of the Clan was signed with different production companies, while maintaining their loyalty as a group. Their first album, 36 Chambers, was hailed as unprecedented, with samples from soul music and kung fu movies. Spanning 128 minutes, the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in Staten Island, New York, and hark back to their original mid-90s lyrics about the Shaolin. It features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers. And as for Cher's cameo appearance, RZA said: 'Did nobody ever have a crush on Cher? She's the ultimate. Ain't nobody like Cher.' Unlike their other albums, it has not been produced by the group's de facto leader RZA but by his apprentice, Moroccan rapper and producer Tarik 'Cilvaringz' Azzougarh - a Wu-Tang fan who visited the group's New York office five times until they took him on. Cilvaringz explains he and RZA were already developing the concept of a record charting the Wu's history when the music industry changed completely. Once Upon A Time In Shaolin has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the Wu's Shaolin symbol and a decorative design by Yahya, a British-Moroccan artist . Collectively, the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other . Within five years singles plummeted to the price of $0.99, and artists were streaming their work for free. Simultaneously, Cilvaringz was chairing an art festival in Morocco, where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars. 'That [was] the first time I asked myself: "Why and how are these artists valued at such a price?" People like Dre or Kanye or RZA are geniuses in what they do, and their music is valued at 99 cents. 'No disrespect to Andy Warhol, Basquiat, Damien Hirst, or any other artists, but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly, "Do you know Damien Hirst? Do you know Basquiat?" they'll say "Who?" If you say, "Do you know Dr. Dre? Do you know Kanye?," they'll say "Yeah."' The album, he says, pays homage to the Wu-Tang Clan's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry. The group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts, thereby dominating the recording industry . 36 Chambers: This was the collective's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene . And despite years of disputes erupting between the clan's members, RZA insists that there was 'no tension' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album, adding 'the eight members, excluding myself, are the most talented MCs I have ever encountered. They are true artists because they aren't taught. You can't teach art.' Speaking later with Genius executive editor Sasha Frere-Jones, RZA described his ambitions: 'Maybe Richard Branson will just buy it and put it on one of his planes and send it to another planet. That'd be dope!' However, Cilvaringz conceded, the fact that the buyer cannot commercialize it means that they could distribute it for free. 'I hope they don't,' RZA said. 'This is unique and something only has value if it is rare.'

Article text: Accused: Ryen William Wilson has been accused of having sex with two students and pursuing two others at Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana . A male science teacher has been suspended after allegations that he had a threesome with two of his high school students in his classroom. Court documents have claimed that Ryen William Wilson also attempted to seduce two other pupils at Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, via text message. Wilson is accused of having sex with two students and pursuing two others. The 30-year-old is now facing two counts of child seduction. It has been claimed that 'Student One' told her friend 'Student Two' that she had been sleeping with Wilson in the academic year of 2013/14. The pair then claim they had a threesome with him, and 'Student One' later told police she had slept with Wilson a total of five times. It is understood the threesome happened only once. On March 13, police then spoke with a third student who said she was good friends with 'Student One' and let her her phone to text with Wilson until she got her own mobile phone. But 'Student Three' then said that Wilson continued to text her separately with comments such as “You know you want this". She also told told police that she was then receiving so many texts from Wilson that she eventually had to change her phone number. According to court documents, the boyfriend of 'Student Three' later spotted the messages, got jealous and confronted Wilson via text. Police then spoke with a fourth student who told police she had also received texts from Wilson where he was regularly complimenting her looks. She said the flattery started after she sent him a question about homework on social media, and he responded saying she should text him on his private number with any further questions. Location: Wayne High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where the alleged threesome and attempted seductions took place . In Indiana, a teen 16 or older can consent to engaging in sexual behavior unless it’s with a person in a position of power like a teacher, adoptive parent/grandparent or military recruiter. Earlier this week, Fort Wayne Community Schools sent out a letter informing parents that two members of staff had been removed from classrooms at Wayne High School due to two separate incidents. It remains unclear why the second member of staff was suspended.

Article text: This is Bristol City's season. Coasting to the League One title and now with a glistening piece of silverware in the cabinet, times are good again at Ashton Gate. This was as straightforward as a Wembley final gets for Steve Cotterill's team, who reaped the first rewards of what has been a stunning season by easily seeing off the challenge of Walsall. In front of 40,000 jubilant fans, they lifted the Johnstone's Paint Trophy following goals from Aden Flint and Mark Little. But it's merely a taste of what is to come. Captain Wade Elliot (centre) lifts the Johnstone's Paint Trophy as his Bristol City team-mates celebrate their triumph . Steve Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted after winning the trophy and City have a terrific chance of a domestic double . Mark Little (2) bundles home the second goal after a goal mouth scrambled left him a clear goal to aim at . With a 10-point advantage over their nearest challengers in Sky Bet League One, City will surely also be lifting a trophy the next time they meet Walsall, in the last game of the season on May 3. Winning this competition for the third time in their history is a nice distraction, but Cotterill will demand his players remain focused on the season's primary task of returning to the Championship. The job is almost done. Like so often in this campaign, they were in control from start to finish here, showing the greater assurance in front of goal in a game of few chances. The full back celebrates in front of the Bristol City fans after he doubled his side's lead . Wembley looked a picture in the spring sunshine, a sea of red with thousands of supporters descending on the national stadium. Bristol City: Fielding; Little, Ayling, Flint, Williams, Bryan (Cunningham 87); K.Smith, Pack, Freeman (Elliott 90); Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 88), Wilbraham (c) Substitutes not used: Richards (GK); Tavernier, Saville, Wagstaff . Scorers: Flint 15; Little 51 . Walsall: O'Donnell; Purkiss, Downing, J Chambers, Taylor; Mantom, A. Chambers (c); Forde (Grimes 74), Sawyers, Cook (Baxendale 80); Bradshaw (Hiwula 61) Substitutes not used: MacGillivray (GK); O'Connor, Cain, Flanagan . Booked: Sawyers . Referee: Mick Russell (Hertfordshire) Attendance: 72,315 . All the pre-match indications pointed to a City victory. Well clear of Preston North End at the League One summit, it would take a Devon Loch-style collapse to deny them a return to the second tier after two seasons away. The Saddlers sit 16th in the standings, some 37 points behind their opponents, but were still optimistic of springing a surprise as they arrived at Wembley for the first time in their 127-year history. They more than matched their opponents in the opening exchanges, with the goal threatened at both ends. City fired the first salvo when Luke Freeman's 20-yard hit cleared the bar on four minutes, Walsall responding when Anthony Forde tested goalkeeper Frank Fielding from range. Then, on the quarter-hour, a breakthrough. City won a corner and Marlon Pack's corner was pinged to the back post. Flint, completely outmuscling his marker to gain the necessary elevation, headed home and sparked delirium among the visitors from Bristol. The tempo of the game immediately dropped and both teams constructed spells of tidy passing football without finding any penetration. Chances were at a premium and scoring opportunities snuffed out as defences dominated. The best of the half-chances came shortly before the break when Walsall's Andy Taylor whistled a shot over from the edge of the box but there was little else to report. You sensed that a second City goal may settle the contest and it duly arrived six minutes after the break. Aden Flint (left) scores the opening goal for Bristol City during the Johnstone's Paint Trophy Final . The big centre half runs away to celebrate his opening goal at Wembley Stadium for Bristol City . Freeman's tricky feet worked space to cross from the left and after O'Donnell blocked Little's first header, he followed up and bundled the ball home with his knee from a few yards out. It was all Little deserved for a fine performance in which he was constantly looking for ways to unpick the Walsall defence. But far from being subdued, Walsall almost responded when Jordan Cook's vicious inswinging cross from the left had to be touched onto the post by Fielding. The guests from the Midlands were briefly encouraged but it didn't spark the resurgence they needed. City were content to sit back and soak up the pressure, duly claiming the first of what will surely be twin trophies this season. Fans make thier way into the stadium prior to the cup final where City came away as winners .

Ground truth Summary: Aden Flint gave Bristol City the lead at Wembley after 15 minutes with a towering header at the far post .
Mark Little doubled the lead when he bundled the ball into the net with replays showing it hit his hand .
Steve Cotterill's side deserved the win over the 90 minutes and lifted the Johnstone's Paint Trophy .

Article text: (CNN)A Russian property developer, a Chinese outfit operating shell companies and Venezuelan officials ripping off the state-owned oil companies -- all of them are accused of coming to a bank in the European principality of Andorra to "wash" their money. Now the U.S. Treasury is casting a spotlight on the alleged misdeeds of senior managers at the Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA), several of whom have been arrested in the past few days. The Treasury Department has alleged that "high-level managers [at BPA] accepted payments and other benefits from their criminal clients." The Andorran authorities took over the running of the bank after the Treasury revelations, and the director general of the Banca Privada, Joan Pau Miquel Prats, was arrested late Friday. Two more bank officials were arrested Sunday. Tiny Andorra, nestled in the rugged Pyrenees mountains, has two big neighbors. One is France. And the scandal has spread to its other neighbor, Spain, where corruption among public officials is a hot-button political issue. Prats had driven BPA's expansion into Spain, through its acquisition of Banco Madrid, in 2011. Banco Madrid caters to wealthy private clients and came under investigation by Spanish financial authorities last year. Since the BPA scandal broke, the commission that investigates illicit financial activity, Sepblac, has raised questions about accounts held by influential Spanish political and business figures at the Banco Madrid. They have not been named. The Central Bank has taken control of Banco Madrid and sent in two inspectors to examine accounts there. The bank's board, which included Prats and a former high-ranking official of the Central Bank, resigned on Thursday. Spanish officials say some 20 suspect operations at the bank are being examined. Spanish authorities are separately investigating substantial assets held at the Banca Privada d'Andorra by members of the Pujol family, who have long been prominent in the politics of Catalonia, a region of Spain that includes Barcelona. The director of the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, said that "BPA's corrupt high-level managers and weak antimoney laundering controls have made BPA an easy vehicle for third-party money launderers to funnel proceeds of organized crime, corruption and human trafficking through the U.S. financial system." BPA has correspondent accounts with four banks -- HSBC, Citigroup, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank -- through which hundreds of millions of dollars passed. Senior managers at BPA tailored services to their clients to disguise the origin of funds, the Treasury said. One manager provided "substantial assistance" to a Russian client, Andrei Petrov, described by the Treasury as a "third-party money launderer working for Russian criminal organizations." Petrov had also received a line of credit from Banco Madrid and is alleged to have bribed local officials in the resort where he set up a property development company. He was arrested in Spain two years ago and is accused of helping launder some 56 million euros ($59 million) in proceeds from Russian criminal organizations. Petrov is yet to go on trial. According to the U.S. Treasury, Petrov has links with one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, Simeon Mogilevich. BPA is also alleged to have helped Venezuelan money launderers siphon funds from the state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. "This money-laundering network worked closely with high-ranking government officials in Venezuela, resident agents in Panama, and an Andorran lawyer to establish Panamanian shell companies," the Treasury said. BPA processed about $2 billion in transactions by shell companies related to the scheme. Treasury said another senior official at BPA accepted bribes in return for processing bulk cash transfers for a Chinese money launderer, Gao Ping, who was arrested in Spain in September 2012. "Through his associate, Ping bribed Andorran bank officials to accept cash deposits into less scrutinized accounts and transfer the funds to suspected shell companies in China," it said in a statement. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's has reacted to the growing scandal by downgrading Andorra's rating. Andorra is highly dependent on its banking sector, which makes up some 20% of its GDP. Spain has long battled the presence of Russian organized crime on its soil. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, wealthy Russians came to Spain for its climate and what were then lax financial controls. Among them were more than a few "vory v zakone," the top echelon of Russian organized crime, according to Spanish officials. Spanish prosecutor Jose Grinda Gonzalez told U.S. officials five years ago that these individuals had no known jobs and unknown sources of income, yet they lived in large mansions. Grinda's remarks were reported in a diplomatic cable later published by WikiLeaks. Grinda had prosecuted Zakhar Kalashov, a Georgian-born, Russian citizen widely regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Russian mafia. Last year, before he completed his nine-year sentence, a Spanish appeals court deported Kalashov to Russia, where he is now a free man. Another Spanish prosecutor, Fernando Bermejo, told US officials in 2009 that there was large scale money-laundering going on in Catalonia and "many, many" members of the Russian mafia were active there. Because of growing international cooperation, Spanish prosecutors have stepped up their pursuit of alleged gang leaders, money launderers and embezzlers from Eastern Europe. Among the latest to be detained is a former finance minister from Ukraine, Yuriy Kolobov. He was detained at a luxury development in Alicante earlier this month, after prosecutors in Kiev charged him with embezzlement and is awaiting extradition. Kolobov was a minister in the government of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled Ukraine during street protests a year ago. Helena Cavendish de Moura contributed to this report .

Article text: A veterinary student was killed in a murder-suicide just two months before graduation and days before she was expected to attend job interviews. Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday. The body of the University of California student was discovered after police staged a seven-hour stand-off outside the duplex, believing there was an armed gunman inside. Scroll down for video . Veterinary student Whitney Engler, 27, was found shot to death in a home she shared with Joseph Hein, 24, in Davis California, on Friday following a murder-suicide . Police received a mysterious 911 call from a man saying two people had been shot to death inside. According to the Sacramento Bee they initially thought it was a hoax, so only entered the building at 1:30am when they threw tear gas through the window. Authorities have not publicly revealed who pulled the trigger, but Whitney's parents told the California paper officials said her daughter was the victim. She and Hein were said to be in a platonic relationship and in a short-term rental agreement - creating mystery around what prompted the tragic events to unfold. After father, Dennis Engler, told the Bee she moved in with Hein in December because the house she had lived in was too crowded. He said the deal was that she would cook in exchange for five months free rent. Whitney's family have said she and Hein (left) had a platonic relationship. He uploaded a picture to Facebook of a card (left) which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________' last year . He also posted images of a black semi-automatic rifle to the social media account . He posted a number of pictures of a semi-automatic rifle on his Facebook last year as well as an image of a card which read: 'Here lies Joseph Hein, 1991-2015, devoted friend, lover of __________.' It had a Cards Against Humanity branding at the bottom, referring to the popular card game. The space is supposed to be filled by a word. Mr Engler said: It’s mystifying. Nothing I’ve learned leads to even a hint of an explanation, which might never be forthcoming. Whitney was a lover of animals and had been looking after a service dog called Rosie at the time. It has since been found after her friends set up a search in the area. Friend and fellow veterinary student Anjolie Anjali Daryani, who led the search for Whitney's pets, said on Facebook on Saturday: 'Last night I lost a good friend, and the world loss an amazing person. Friend Anjolie Anjali Daryani said Whitney was only two months away from graduating and had a number of job interviews planned this weekend . 'Whitney Engler I hope that you rest in peace and know that we are all doing everything we can to find Rosie. 'I will never forget all of our time spent together.. whether it was horseriding, training our dogs, going out to dinners, going shopping, or just hanging out I will miss those moments dearly.' She told Fox 40: 'She had job interviews set up this weekend, she’s less than 2 months away from graduation.' On Saturday night, a vigil was held by Whitney's friends on campus. More than 200 people gathered on the patio of Gladys Valley Hall. Police received a mysterious 911 call on Friday from a man saying two people had been shot to death inside. It prompted a stand-off outside the building which lasted for seven hours .

Article text: The Conservatives are planning a ‘kill Ukip’ campaign in the Kent constituency where Nigel Farage is standing for Parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses . Tory HQ is planning a ‘kill Ukip’ campaign in the Kent constituency where Nigel Farage is standing for Parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses. Mr Farage declared yesterday that it would be ‘curtains’ for him if he fails to win the Ukip target seat of South Thanet. He conceded it would be impossible for him to continue to dictate Ukip policy without a seat in the House of Commons. Ukip is aiming to win around half a dozen seats, but Mr Farage appears to face a tougher fight than Douglas Carswell, the Tory defector who won a big majority when he stood for Ukip in a by-election. Polls suggest he is in a three-way battle with Labour and the Conservatives. The Tories hold the seat, while Labour previously held it with slightly different borders. Conservative strategists believe Mr Farage has made a significant blunder by tying his fortunes in South Thanet to his future as party leader. ‘This is a great opportunity,’ said one. ‘We can now make this a decapitation campaign. If voters who have previously backed other parties want to stop Ukip, they can vote for us and cut the head off the snake.’ The strategist said that if Mr Farage stood down after losing the seat, Mr Carswell was likely to take over and ‘that would be the end of Ukip’. Other candidates to succeed the Ukip leader include communities spokesman Suzanne Evans and former journalist Patrick O’Flynn, both Euro MPs. Mr Farage appears at odds over several areas of policy with key members of his team, Mr Carswell, who has expressed concern about the ‘ugly nativism’ of some Ukip supporters and spoken in favour of immigration. The Clacton MP is also seen as lacking in the broad popular appeal of Mr Farage by Tory campaign chiefs. A Survation poll commissioned by a Ukip donor in South Thanet found Mr Farage to be ahead, but one previous survey had him neck and neck with the Tories and another put the Tories ahead. In an extract from a new book by the Ukip leader, The Purple Revolution, serialised in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage made clear he would quit as party leader if he fails to become an MP. ‘It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat,’ he wrote. ‘What credibility would Ukip have in the Commons if others had to enunciate party policy in parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest? ‘Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No – if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.’ Yesterday Ukip won a boost when broadcasting regulator Ofcom awarded it a second party election broadcast on commercial TV and radio on the basis that it is now a ‘major party’. David Cameron's strategists hope that defeating Mr Farage would 'cut the head off the snake' of Ukip . The bodys guaranteed Ukip a minimum of two broadcasts in England and Wales on ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, alongside the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats. But it said the Greens had not demonstrated sufficient electoral support to justify a similar elevation in status. Mr Farage said: ‘This confirms that Ukip is now a major party in British politics. Voters should now know that despite what all the other parties are going to tell them, the truth is self-evident: if you believe in Britain, and want to vote Ukip, you’ll get a Ukip MP. It’s great news.’

Tories plan to appeal to voters from across the spectrum to help defeat him .

Article text: A couple accused of claiming £42,500 in benefits while sending their children to a top private school and living in a £1,950 a month house were cleared today. Judge William Hart threw out the case against Leslie and Sarah Grant because  the Department of Work and Pensions lost letters written by Mr Grant that would have supported his case. The 67-year-old from Cheltenham insisted he had written to the DWP notifying them of a change in his financial circumstances. During the trial the Government department denied ever receiving these letters but in evidence yesterday Tracey Tye, a DWP investigator, conceded there was a computer record of letters being received from him. Cleared: Sarah and Leslie Grant were accused of claiming £42,000 of benefits while getting an income from businesses and £50,000 in the bank - but the DWP lost a series of important letters, collapsing the case . She said they could not be accessed to check their contents because they had been ‘archived’ and were not longer retrievable. Judge Hart ruled that because the prosecution was unable to produce the letters to show whether they contained what Mr Grant alleged it would be unsafe to leave the case to the jury. He directed the jury to find the couple not guilty of defrauding the DWP between 2009 and 2011. The couple had been accused of falsely claiming £42,500, consisting of £19,000 of pension benefit, £19,000 of housing benefit and £4,500 of council tax benefit to fund their lifestyle. Sarah Grant, also received a £40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband Leslie, 67, were claiming benefits, Gloucester Crown Court heard. Mr and Mrs Grant say they were penniless as a number of businesses went bust and needed state support. This was received while Mrs Grant got money from her mum, there was income from the pair's businesses and business account were being used for personal expenditure, it was said. Prosecutors also say they had around £50,000 in the bank, but today a second forensic accountant told the court she felt that the Grants had no income entering their bank accounts. Mr Grant, 67, had been receiving pension credit since November 2007, despite running his wife's companies, Hadleigh Partnership, Hadleigh Development and Sarafino Ltd, prosecutors claim. Funds were used to sent their children to Dean Close School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and to pay for expensive child care and high rent. Investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £1,950 a month rent with just £775 a month housing allowance. Mrs Grant was questioned by benefit officials in May 2010 and said that her parents had paid the rent shortfalls and school fees. Top private school: The Grants' children attended £32,000-a-year Dean Close School in Cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits, the court heard . The couple, from Cheltenham, claim that the firms they were involved in at the time were in liquidation. On Wednesday a forensic accountant told the court that after analysing the pair's bank accounts it was clear they had more than £48,000 available to them. Neil Ward explained that between them the pair had four bank accounts and his job was to analyse the accounts to decide what was 'personal' income and what related to the business. He told the jury that he assessed each payment made and even went through nine ring binders full of receipts to try and ascertain where cash had been spent. In his report he also asked: 'What is income? Luxury items such as school fees, extravagant holidays, expensive purchases, nice clothes, could all mean an income. 'If you're spending on these things there must be a source to do it'. He told that £40,000 of that had come from Mrs Grant's mother. The defence argued that it therefore counted as a gift, but when prosecutor, Tara Wolfe, asked the witness: 'would a gift of £40,000 be eligible for pension credit?' he responded: 'I believe so'. Mr and Mrs Grant both deny falsely claiming pension credits and housing and council tax benefit without declaring they had other income. But defence witness Helen Gregory- a forensic accountant - said the couple were clearly struggling with money as a number of their businesses went under. She explained how Sarafinos Ltd, a coffee shop opened in Folkestone and Birmingham, was hoped to become a chain but it collapsed shortly after opening. Instead the pair opened a restaurant called The Courtyard in Cheltenham. The couple also opened D'Altos, a company aimed at running fast food outlets which ran for just two months. The couple's building companies, Hadleigh Partnership and Hadleigh Development also went into liquidation. Hearing: Judge William Hart threw out the case at Gloucester Crown Court (above) after a DWP blunder . Mrs Gregory also argued that the £40,000 given to Sarah Grant by her mother was clearly a loan and did not count as income. She said: 'They were struggling. They were doing their best to make things work. They had a number of businesses and they had become accustomed to a certain lifestyle. 'Their businesses went under but they were trying to maintain that level of living. 'It took them about a year to try and get back on their feet financially. 'I don't believe they were receiving any income. I understood the money to be a short term loan from Mrs Grant's mother to get her back on her feet.'

Article text: A  young driver has escaped serious injury after rolling his vehicle on a remote Northern Territory highway - only to be stung by a swarm of angry bees that escaped his trailer. Police say the 18-year-old  was towing a trailer with crates full of bees when the trailer's wheel clipped the edge of the road, 17 km north of Katherine on Thursday afternoon. Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen said the driver lost control, the vehicle fish-tailed and flipped about 10 metres into scrub land, dislodging the bee crates. A young driver was stung by a swarm of angry bees after crashing his car, which was towing a trailer of the insects . The 18-year-old was towing crates full of bees when  he lost control of his vehicle near Katherine in Australia's Northern Territory . 'The bees became angry and escaped,' swarming the area and stinging the man on the face three times, Duty Supt Jorgensen said. The young driver managed to crawl out with minor swelling and pain, but was otherwise uninjured. Duty Supt Jorgensen said the bees were more of an issue than the wreckage when they arrived on the scene, as emergency services aren't equipped with bee-keeping hats as part of their personal protection. According to police, the scene was safely cleared and no charges are expected. Police say the bees were a bigger problem than the wreckage when they arrived on the scene because emergency services aren't equipped with bee-keeping protective gear .

Article text: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has vowed to protect British soldiers if the Conservatives win the General Election . British soldiers will be protected from ‘ambulance-chasing’ lawyers if the Conservatives win the General Election, the Defence Secretary pledged last night. Human rights laws will be ‘ripped up’ to ensure those who fight for their country can no longer be hounded in the courts, Michael Fallon said. He promised to end ‘abuse’ of the Human Rights Act by law firms and so-called victims, who he said were lodging claims on an ‘industrial scale’. Such claims were costing the taxpayer millions of pounds and undermining the vital work of the military, Mr Fallon warned. The Tories will confirm their commitment to diminish the UK’s membership of the European Convention on Human Rights in their manifesto. As part of this, the Human Rights Act will be scrapped and soldiers will be subject to a new British Bill of Rights which will reflect the pressures they face in combat. Mr Fallon said: ‘This abuse has got to stop and the next Tory government will limit the reach of human rights cases to the UK so our forces overseas are not subject to persistent human rights claims.’ Figures yesterday showed legal claims over incidents involving British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan have already cost the taxpayer nearly £90million over the last ten years – a figure expected to soar even further. Many of the so-called ‘victims’ of these incidents have used the ECHR to demand millions of pounds in compensation. Two public inquiries alone have cost the Ministry of Defence £55.9million. The Al Sweady Inquiry looked into claims lodged by two legal-aid-funded firms – Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day – that British troops murdered, mutilated and tortured Iraqi detainees. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured, said yesterday: ‘We can’t go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws' After an inquiry costing £31million, the allegations were found to be ‘wholly and entirely without merit or justification’. Despite this, the law firms are continuing to pursue cases against the MoD for deaths in Iraq using the Human Rights Act. If the rules are not changed, top brass fear being bombarded by 2,230 more legal claims. There are concerns that troops will in future have to call a lawyer before taking action – even in the heat of a battle. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said yesterday: ‘We can’t go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws … I made it clear last year that I want to rip up Labour’s Human Rights Act and that it is only the Conservatives who will make real changes to the human rights framework to restore some common sense.’ Rules governing conflict would fall under the Geneva Convention, which allows lethal force as a first resort against enemy combatants. Last night former military chiefs welcomed the move. Colonel Tim Collins, served in the Iraq War, said: ‘It is about time this happened. To [some] lawyers … the Iraqis are only a vehicle for profit. It is a shameless racket and must be stopped for everyone’s dignity.’ Soldier Kevin Williams, who was repeatedly hounded by lawyers over the death of an Iraqi man, said: ‘To hear the Tories are going to support soldiers is a relief.’ Sergeant Kevin Williams, pictured, ‘put on trial for 12 years’ for killing an Iraqi . The 32-year-old, who shot Hassan Abbas Said in a violent struggle in 2003, was cleared by two military investigations only then to face a murder charge – but was once again cleared. He was served with a letter last year hauling him before a new probe into Iraqi deaths as part of the Iraq Fatality Investigations, brought about to comply with Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. Seven paratroopers, found not guilty after nine-week trial costing up to £8million but hounded again . The court martial of seven paratroopers accused of murdering an Iraqi teenager collapsed in 2005 after the judge branded some Iraqi witnesses as seekers of ‘blood money’. They were hauled before new investigators as part of the Iraq Fatality Investigations and faced fresh scrutiny over their roles last year. The investigations were brought in order to ‘fulfil the investigation duties of the State’, in accordance with Article 2 of the Human Rights Act. Sergeant Barry Singleton, cleared of wrongdoing after a two-year investigation but now faces more questions . The 33-year-old Scot, who shot an Iraqi civilian at a checkpoint in Basra 11 years ago, had his case dropped in 2005. Now the Iraq Historic Allegations Team – set up to comply with the Human Rights Act – have told him they are investigating the shooting as part of their investigations into alleged war crimes in Iraq and he was told he could face charges. The family making the case are represented by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers.

Article text: A centuries-old secret  letter has been discovered under the floorboards of a former boarding school which featured in the works of Charles Dickens. The 200-year-old note was uncovered as part of renovation works at the 16th century Eastgate House in Rochester, Kent. Written in copper-plate handwriting, it is thought to have been sent by a former pupil at the Victorian girl's boarding school. The 200-year-old note was uncovered as part of renovation works at the 16th century Eastgate House in Rochester, Kent . Written in copper-plate handwriting, it is thought to have been written by a former pupil at the Victorian girl's boarding school . Addressing 'my dear little girl', the author- who signs their name simply as N Brunenell- appears to forgive the recipient for some long-forgotten upset. It was then stashed under the floorboards and forgotten for more than 200 years. Built in the 16th century as a private home, the building has since been used as a Victorian boarding school, a young men's hostel, a restaurant and a museum. My Dear little Girl, . I am very willing to excuse you. no my dear Girl I bear no Malice I will come present-ly and kiss you if that will do any good. Allow me to remain, my dear . Your Friend that you are . N Brunenell . Other theories surrounding the letter suggest it may be a love note from a resident to his sweetheart during the building's use as a  hostel. But the Grade I listed building is most notable for its association with celebrated English writer Charles Dickens. The Victorian social critic is likely to have visited the building which he featured as Westgate in The Pickwick Papers and as the Nun's House in The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Most recently the historic property was used as a Dickens Museum and the famous Swiss chalet, where the writer penned several of his novels, was relocated from Gad's Hill in the 1960s. A multi-million pound conservation project is under way to bring the building back into public use and create a community space with improved visitor facilities and access. The secret letter was discovered under the floorboards of Eastgate, the  former boarding school which featured in the works of Charles Dickens . The note was uncovered during a multi-million pound conservation project which is under way to bring the building back into public use . The letter is just one of many finds uncovered by contractors who are renovating town house in Rochester High Street. Others include a toothbrush made of bone, a farthing dated 1923, a thimble and a gentleman's collar pin. Site manager Jay Westwood, said everyday they were finding new historical treasures and described it as 'an honour to work on it.' Lawrence Best, contracts manager at Fairhurst Ward Abbotts added: 'This has already proved to be a fascinating project which will no doubt result in the discovery of further artefacts offering a glimpse into the building's rich history. The letter is just one of many finds uncovered by contractors who are renovating the Grade I listed town house in Rochester High Street . 'Our experience of the heritage sector will ensure that any discoveries are protected and that Eastgate House is sympathetically conserved. 'This will include restoring many of the property's original historic features, such as decorative plaster ceilings, which will be returned to the way they were in the 16th century. 'We're proud to be involved in such an important project and look forward to providing a fantastic new community space and leading tourist attraction that will ensure Eastgate House remains a much loved part of the local community.' Once work is complete at the historic house, it will re-open to the public in 2016 for the first time in more than 30 years, with exhibitions and displays telling the story of the building and those who have lived and worked there for more than 400 years. The 16th century Eastgate House was built for Sir Peter Buck, Mayor of Medway . Eastgate House was built in the 1590s for Sir Peter Buck, Mayor of Medway and Clerk of the Cheque at Chatham Dockyard. Five generations of the Buck family were associated with the house until 1687 where it passed into the hands of the Parkers, and later the Bartholomews. In 1761 the house was held by Annabel Darwin, but possibly let to tenants. It passed to James Reed in 1791 who is thought to have originally founded the school. By 1841 it was under the governorship of Rebecca Norton and there were 14 boarders. It was in this guise that Charles Dickens incorporated it - as 'The Nuns' House' - into his last, unfinished, novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Eastgate House also features as The Westgate Seminary for Young Ladies in The Pickwick Papers. Eastgate House once again became a private dwelling in the 1870s, being the home of Samuel Shaw, a wholesale coal merchant. Its transition to a young men's hostel in 1890 appears to have been fairly brief as it had become a temperance restaurant by 1897 when Rochester City Council resolved to turn it into a municipal library and museum in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. In 1923 an extension to the museum, a new formal garden and a caretaker's cottage - 'Eastgate Cottage' - were added. The Dickens Chalet was relocated here from Cobham Hall in 1961. In 1979 the museum was moved to the Guildhall, and Eastgate House became the Dickens Centre, with displays devoted to the author's life and works. The Dickens Centre closed on 31st October 2004. Work is now underway, with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to transform the house into an exhibition centre for art and history events.

Article text: Jerusalem (CNN)A newly released ISIS video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an Israeli spy. The video identifies the man as 19-year-old Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam, an Israeli citizen of Palestinian descent. In the video, ISIS shows Musallam's Israeli passport and claims he's an agent sent to infiltrate the group. The 19-year-old's family told CNN Tuesday that he had no ties with the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and had, in fact, been recruited by ISIS. "Mohamed told me and his brother that ISIS took him," according to Said Musallam, his father. "They sent him money through the Western Union. They said you will have girls, money, cars, villas, paradise, but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing." It wasn't long before Musallam's family members didn't recognize him when they talked to him on Skype. The man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle. His father tried to help him get home, sending him money and even enlisting the Red Cross. But his son never made it back to Israel. About a month ago, Said Musallam said, he was told his son was taken by ISIS when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border. A video posted Tuesday on ISIS-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be Musallam on his knees, wearing an orange jumpsuit. An adult ISIS fighter and a child -- both in fatigues -- stand behind him. The adult, speaking French, gives a command to the child to go forward with the killing. The child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots Musallam in the forehead. The man immediately falls forward to the ground. The child appears to then fire at least two more shots into the body. Ahmad Musallam said he'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death. "I used to take care of him and babysit him when Mom went to work," he said, crying. "Mohamed is not a brother. He is a son." But he refuses to show the video to his parents, who still can't believe their son is dead. An issue last month of ISIS' English-language propaganda magazine, Dabiq, included a purported interview with Musallam and described his alleged work for the Israeli spy agency. In the ISIS video, Musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession, saying he is an Israeli intelligence agent working for Mossad, sent to infiltrate ISIS. Musallam's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video, forced to lie about ties to Israeli intelligence. "Mohamed is not an agent. Mohamed  doesn't have a shekel. If he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life," his mother, Hind Musallam, said. "We could have been living a different life and I would not be working cleaning houses so we can live." This isn't the first time ISIS has used children to drive home its message. An ISIS propaganda video released in January -- one that CNN could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head. The boy then stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol high. Last August, a photo posted to Twitter from an ISIS stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man's severed head and his father's words, "That's my boy." ISIS has featured children as fighters before, calling them the "cubs of the caliphate" (the adult jihadis call each other "lions") and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families. It has taken over schools to indoctrinate children. Human Rights Watch says ISIS and other extremist groups "have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions." CNN's Stefan Simons, Cynde Strand, Ben Wedeman, Kevin Flower, Catherine E. Shoichet, Faith Karimi, Greg Botelho and Jessica King contributed to this report.

Article text: Alan Catterall, 54, was burned to death at work when the door slammed shut on the industrial oven he was cleaning . A business has been  fined £200,000 over the death of a worker who became trapped inside an industrial oven which was then accidentally turned on by his future son-in-law. Alan Catterall, 54, died while carrying out cleaning work at Runcorn-based Kayak company, Pyranha Mouldings in December 2010. The father-of-three from Halewood, Liverpool, had gone inside to clean molten plastic escaping from a mould while the oven was switched off after a fault developed. Liverpool Crown Court heard the oven had developed a fault with a guide rail bearing and had been shut down for maintenance so the bearing could be fixed. But once the maintenance work had been completed the oven was switched back on by colleague Mark Francis, who was engaged to Mr Catterall's daughter, and put into warm-up mode. A few minutes later smoke was seen coming from the oven and when operators opened the door to find the source they discovered Mr Catterall's body. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The court heard Mr Catterall suffered severe burns and died of shock after becoming trapped in the large bespoke oven, which was designed to accommodate the moulds for two kayaks. He was a senior supervisor at the company, which manufactures kayaks and canoes, and had worked there for 12 years. Pyranha Mouldings was also found guilty of two charges under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Peter Mackereth, 60, managing director of the company, was convicted of two charges under Section 37 of the Health and Safety at Work Act. Sentencing was adjourned until today when the trial judge, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, imposed the £200,000 fine. Mackereth was given a suspended sentence and a fine of £25,000. The judge imposed a total prison sentence of nine months, suspended for two years. Mr Justice MacDuff awarded costs against the two defendants jointly in the total sum of £90,000. The judge said there were 'a number of serious failings in the design of this and other moulding ovens' - the design and commissioning of which had been done in-house. Mr Justice MacDuff said Mr Catterall was 'by all accounts the most lovely of men', devoted to his family 'and loved by all'. 'He was a committed worker and had given 100% and more to his employers,' said the judge. His wife Pearl had 'behaved with dignity throughout'. He added: 'Her loss, I know, is nearly unbearable and she knows that I can do nothing to bring back her husband.' Mr Catterall, 54, died while carrying out cleaning work at Runcorn-based Kayak company, Pyranha Mouldings in December 2010. Liverpool Crown Court heard the oven had developed a fault with a guide rail bearing and had been shut down for maintenance so the bearing could be fixed.  The company was today fined £20,000 . When announcing the fine to be imposed on the company, the judge said that what happened was 'in the true sense' an accident: 'It was an avoidable accident but nevertheless an accident; an accident courted by no-one.' Referring to Mr Catterall's family, the judge said: 'At least they are able to understand that their loss was not caused by a deliberate unlawful act; rather it was a result of oversight, negligence, sins of omission and not of commission, but sins nevertheless.' Sentencing Mackereth, he said: 'You do not need me to tell you how far short of your duty you fell. It was repeatedly brought home to you at the trial. 'You will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life. The company may only act through its directors and senior officers. 'Whereas others were also involved, you had to accept that you took the lead in designing and commissioning these ovens. The company's failure was also your failure - although the full responsibility does not fall on your shoulders. Rightly you were not charged with gross negligence manslaughter.' The judge said he fully accepted that Mackereth and Mr Catterall were friends 'and that you were also devastated by the loss'. He told Mackereth: 'I have given the matter careful thought and have reached the conclusion that I should mark the gravity of your offending by imposing a prison sentence, albeit that there are circumstances which enable me to suspend that sentence.'

Article text: The song is straightforward and carries the usual expletive, for semi-rhyme as well as effect. Gabby Agbonlahor, cry Aston Villa fans to the tune of Karma Chameleon, is rather fast. That’s the clean version. The frequency with which the words are heard from now until the end of the season will prove largely correlative to Villa’s chances of remaining a Premier League team. They have not been sounded all too often this campaign. But at Villa Park on Tuesday night, especially during the first half, Agbonlahor produced a performance to warrant adulation. Gabby Agbonlahor salutes the Villa Park crowd in celebration after opening the scoring against West Brom . Agbonlahor threads the ball through Ben Foster's legs to give the hosts the lead in the Midlands derby . It was arguably his best display in years, a return to those days when his speed and strength shot him into the England set-up. Agbonlahor consistently harried Gareth McAuley and Joleon Lescott, chasing down balls he had no obligation to reach, using his stocky physique to keep hold of possession when under threat. Christian Benteke got the headlines for his late winning goal, but it was Agbonlahor who set the tone. His goal was a classic case of pace proving the difference. He latched onto Benteke’s nodded flick and finished while making statues of the West Bromwich Albion central defenders. He did similar when creating a pass out Ashley Westwood’s hopeful ball, sprinting to startle the opposition backline and only being denied a second by Lescott’s goalline clearance. Boy George’s ditty rang loud. Agbonlahor beat Foster again shortly after but Joleon Lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line . Agbonlahor reacts after West Brom keeper Foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line . Foster initially caught the shot from Agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly . In all, he had three shots on target – including the badly fumbled effort by Ben Foster than nearly trickled over the line – which is a significant uplift of recent matches. In this statistic, the sequence of his last 12 games reads: 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1. Fantastic figures should Jimmy Anderson be bowling a couple of overs at the death in the World Cup. As shots on target for a Premier League striker? Not so much. Agbonlahor failed to test the goalkeepers of Newcastle, Chelsea, Arsenal (admittedly as a substitute), Liverpool, Leicester, Crystal Palace, Manchester United (albeit sent off unjustly after 65 minutes) and West Bromwich Albion. His inability in that period to make a difference in opponents’ penalty areas is symptomatic of Villa’s wider attacking paralysis, stymied by a style that ranked possession over purpose to an adverse extent. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after Agbonlahor's goal . Christian Benteke sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for Aston Villa . It is hard as a centre-forward to strike for goal if the ball is rarely within 30 yards of the target. Agbonlahor would often operate on the wings under Paul Lambert too. This is not to absolve the 28-year-old. As one of the club’s senior figures his form has been disappointing, particularly since he signed a new four-year contract last September. Born locally and graduating from Villa’s youth set up he is a supporter of the club and the depth of his feeling has been clear in his commitment since he broke through to the first team nine years ago. So it has been odd to see his on-field demeanour at certain times this season, exhibiting none of the vim Villa fans know well. Benteke celebrates his goal with Aston Villa team-mates Jack Grealish and Andreas Weimann . Brad Guzan looked on in horror as Saido Berahino equalised for the visitors before Benteke's winner . That was back with a bang against West Brom. Tim Sherwood restored Agbonlahor up front alongside Benteke and allowed for the direct style that suits their attributes. Agbonlahor found the net for the first time in 14 matches and it proved valuable. Each one of his four Premier League goals has counted for something: a draw against Southampton and wins against Liverpool and Hull, accompanying the West Brom victory. Seven extra points in total. Sherwood knows the worth of the player whose speed is celebrated in chant. The Villa manager needs to continue utilising his talents for the final 10 Premier League matches to make sure this spark of brilliance does not fizzle out. Agbonlahor on song means Villa should stay up.

Article text: CDC officials have arrived at a Louisiana research center to try to determine how at least seven monkeys became exposed to a deadly bacteria used in bioweapons. Three of the monkeys had to be euthanized after showing signs of the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre Tulane National Primate Research Center, USA Today reported. Despite thorough investigations by authorities, the cause of the contamination is still unknown. Questions also remain over how far the bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has spread around the complex and surrounding areas. Concerns: Monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened . Reach: Worryingly, the center is close to a river (top left), homes and a school. Although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria, further tests are required . Animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas. The bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure, but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals. The monkeys, rhesus macaques, had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages, where around 4,000 macaques are kept. It is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages. Worryingly, the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes. And only yards behind the facility, there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges. The contaminated primates were all at the center's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall, leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there. Infected: At least seven rhesus macaques (file picture) have shown signs of exposure and three have died . Potentially deadly: Burkholderia pseudomallei . The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle and joint pain. The illness may not develop for days to years. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and if left untreated, it is fatal. Several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. The bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has never been found in nature in the U.S. Last week, tests by the CDC determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria, bring the number of infected monkeys to seven. The CDC will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital, the agency said. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told USA Today that the release was worrying. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he said. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. 'The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' State officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed. Authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area, suggesting there was no public health risk.
----------------------------------------
Ground truth Summary: At least seven rhesus macaques at the Tulane National Primate Research Center have been exposed to the potentially deadly bacteria .
They were exposed even though the bacterium was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre research complex .
Initial tests indicate that it has not spread to surrounding areas - which include a school and homes - but further tests are required .
The potentially deadly bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is not found in the U.S. and can be contracted through contact with contaminated areas .

Article text: Sunrise panellists Elka Whalan and Sally Obermeder have come under fire after suggesting parents had the right to choose whether to vaccinate their kids. Both mums joined host David Koch and commentator Shelly Horton on the program for a spirited debate about vaccination on Wednesday morning. The discussion came just weeks after baby Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital after suffering complications from whooping cough. In views later labelled 'dangerous and irresponsible', Ms Whalan suggested parents should take anti-vaccination views into consideration. And in a fiery exchange with host David Koch, Ms Obermeder said that parents choose whether or not to vaccinate out of love for their children. Scroll down for video . David Koch, the father of four adult children and a grandfather, was vocal in his defence of vaccination . Fiery debate: Former swimmer Elka Whalan (centre) and Daily Edition host Sally Obermeder said parents should investigate both sides of the vaccination debate. Shelly Horton (left) said parents should 'definitely' vaccinate their children . Under fire: The Daily Edition host Sally Obermeder (pictured left) is the mother of toddler Annabelle, while former swimmer Elka Whalan (right) is pictured while pregnant in 2011 with her husband Thomas Whalan . Ms Whalan said: 'We are hearing this terrible story (about baby Riley) but we are also not hearing figures of people who have also died from being vaccinated as well.' The former Olympic swimmer said she vaccinated her children, adding that people need to 'research both sides of the story'. Ms Obermeder, the host of The Daily Edition and a mother of one, argued: 'Isn't it the parents' right to choose what they want for their child?' 'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child,' she told the panel. 'Parents love their kids, and they make the best decision... (they) think they're making.' Her remarks sparked a heated riposte from David Koch, a grandfather and the dad of four adult children. Koch said parents must depend on the word of experts, not 'Dr Google' (or information parents find online). 'There is no argument,' he said. Ms Obermeder said parents should speak to their doctors about vaccination and that people would then 'probably decide' to vaccinate. 'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child', Ms Obermeder told the panel . Koch (left) said: 'If you talk vaccinations in general, it isn't their decision if it effects somebody else's child... Not if it affects my grandkids'. Obermeder (right) said: 'Parents love their kids, and they make the best decision... think they're making' Poppa Koch: The Sunrise host poses alongside family members at a Disney On Ice premiere last year . Media personality Mia Freedman flayed Elka Whalan for her remarks on Twitter . Media identity Mia Freedman honed in on Ms Whalan's comments on social media, labelling them 'truly dangerous and irresponsible' in a series of Twitter posts. Ms Whalan fired back: '@MiaFreddman every parent & person well educated has the right to research. I am pro vaccine but you must see every side.' The parents of Riley Hughes urged parents to get their children vaccinated earlier this month. After their call, West Australian authorities approved a plan for mums-to-be to receive free whooping cough vaccinations. Around 2500 mums will be eligible to receive the jabs each month. 'Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,' Riley's dad Greg wrote on the family's Facebook page. Riley Hughes (pictured) died after complications from whooping cough. He was remembered at a memorial service last week .

Article text: Steven Gerrard was sensationally sent off within 38 seconds of coming on the pitch at Anfield, after stamping on Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera. The Liverpool legend was left out of the starting line-up by Brendan Rodgers but came on at the start of the second half to rally the troops. However Gerrard found himself in deep trouble after clattering through Juan Mata before stamping on Herrera following a heavy challenge. Referee Martin Atkinson had no choice but to send off the perplexed Liverpool skipper after just 38 seconds of entering the fray. Steven Gerrard is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson after just 38 seconds of the second half . Gerrard can't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on United's Ander Herrera at Anfield . As Gerrard emerged from the tunnel, former Liverpool team-mate Jamie Carragher told Sky Sports: ‘He had to go on. Some of the Liverpool players froze out there in the first-half. Liverpool need some football arrogance on the pitch today.’ Ahead of kick-off Carragher admitted he was not surprised by Brendan Rodgers' decision to name Steven Gerrard on the bench for Liverpool's crunch clash against Manchester United. Gerrard, who faced rivals United for the last time in a Liverpool shirt, had to make do with a place on the bench as Rodgers decided to go for a central midfield duo of Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen. Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch . Here is the stamp from Gerrard on Herrera after both players had competed for the ball . Gerrard clearly puts all his downwards force into Herrera's right leg after the pair collided . Gerrard flings back the captain's armband towards his team-mates having been sent off at Anfield . A evidently devastated Steven Gerrard leaves the pitch after just 38 seconds having been sent off . And Carragher felt it was the right decision. Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of the Anfield battle, the former Liverpool defender said: 'No I'm not surprised. 'He’s only played 20 minutes against Swansea recently because he’s been injured. 'Is Steven Gerrard a better player than Joe Allen? Yes. But for Brendan Rodgers we’ve got to remember than Gerrard is leaving in the summer and Allen will be here next season. So although Rodgers is aiming for the top four that certainly comes into it. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was named on the bench for his side's match against Man United . Brendan Rodgers made the right call in naming Gerrard on bench before kick-off, according to Carragher . 'Steven Gerrard can come on after an hour and really lift the crowd when the legs are tired and use any extra space.' Carragher's fellow pundits Thierry Henry and Gary Neville also agreed with Rodgers' decision. Neville said: 'It’s probably the starting line-up Manchester United expected. 'The question was more about whether Rodgers would return with the Manchester City formation with [Raheem] Sterling at the top but that would sacrifice Daniel Sturridge who brings them goals and is their best finisher, so he’s stuck.' Gerrard has scored the most goals in the history of Liverpool's matches against Manchester United . While Henry added: 'Gerrard would tell you if he’s not fit and the team is playing very well. 'Look he has the quality to come on and change the game. I wouldn’t say he should start but it would be an amazing story if he got the winner.' Rodgers insisted before the match that Gerrard understood the decision regarding his omission. ‘Steven’s got a great history in this fixture but also across his career,' explained the Liverpool boss. 'He’s still a top class player but he understands the team is playing well. I had a word with him earlier in the week and told him my plan to stick with the team and he’s been brilliant working with the players. He’s definitely ready if he’s called upon.' The 34-year-old has played 34 times against Manchester United during his prestigious career at Anfield .

Article text: David Tuohy, 83, was found dead in the River Thames near his Oxford home just days before he was due to be sentenced for historic sexual assualts . A former headmaster who was found guilty of molesting boys as young as ten at a special needs school in the 1970s has been found dead just days before he was due to be sentenced. The body of David Tuohy, 83, was found floating in the River Thames close to his home in Oxford earlier this week. He was due to be sentenced at Norfolk Crown Court on Monday after earlier being found guilty of 15 counts of sexual assault following a nine-day trial. He was in charge of Eccles Hall School, in Quidenham, Norfolk, in the 1970s when he carried out the indecent and serious sexual assaults against five pupils, who all had special needs and were under 13. Norfolk police confirmed Tuohy had been found dead in the River Thames and said his death was being treated as 'unexplained but not suspicious'. A spokesman said: 'Norfolk Constabulary can confirm 83-year-old David William Tuohy who was due to be sentenced after being found guilty of a string of sexual offences against pupils at an independent school has died.' A Thames Valley Police spokesman said a body was reported in the water at around 6pm on Tuesday and the man was declared dead at the scene after being recovered by police divers. Officers had been called to the Osney Lock area of Oxford after a member of the public reported a bloodstain and a watch. Tuohy's family and victims have been informed of his death, police confirmed. Last month, Norfolk Crown Court heard how Tuohy liked to discipline boys who came to the school from different parts of the UK and found themselves alone, isolated and separated from their families. He was also said to be 'obsessed with spanking' and the prosecution said he had a 'particular deviant sexual fascination with the bottoms of very young boys.' Prosecutor Andrew Shaw added: 'It was a boarding school which catered for children who had not thrived in mainstream education in areas all over the country - in today's language we would say they had special educational or behavioural needs. 'They were separated from their families and plunged in to an unfamiliar environment. 'As one of the people charged with the duty of caring for these children, he abused the trust placed in him and used these children for his own sexual gratification.' Detective Constable Faith Morris, from Norfolk Police, said Tuohy had used a position of 'absolute trust' to abuse his victims. 'The fact Tuohy pleaded not guilty to all counts meant his victims were forced to relive the traumatic events which occurred all those years ago,' she said of his trial. Tuohy was a headmaster at Eccles Hall in Quidenham, Norfolk, (pictured) in the 1970s when he indecently assaulted five pupils - all of whom had special needs and were aged under 13. He was convicted of 15 charges . Tuohy was originally arrested in June last year and charged with four counts of indecent assault and four counts of buggery against one victim. Four further victims then came forward resulting in Tuohy being charged with a further 14 indecent assaults. All of the charges related to five boys, who were aged under 13, between September 1972 and March 1983. He was found not guilty of three of the indecent assault charges and the four buggery charges but convicted of the remaining 15 indecent assaults. The sex abuse came to light when one of the victims reported it to police, prompting other victims to come forward. Eccles Hall, which is now known as the New Eccles Hall School, is an independent day and boarding school in East Anglia for children aged seven to 18.

Article text: (CNN)I was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago. I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher. I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment. Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety. When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon. When we arrived in Jordan, I thought I would return soon to Syria -- in only a few weeks. We all thought so. It's been two years. And while I still hope to go home one day, my biggest question is: "When?" I want to return so that I can teach. As a child, I was inspired by my third-grade teacher, who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world. I think it's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students, but I want to try. Although I hope to follow in my teacher's footsteps, my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home, by a war that has driven me here, by tuition costs in Jordan that are prohibitively expensive. Being away from home presents many challenges. You feel like a stranger in a foreign place. You're not among people who know you, or who want to know you.  As a Syrian refugee, it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed, and I've no money to complete my studies. Overnight, my dreams changed. In one moment I was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying English, of becoming a schoolteacher.  In the next, it all feels lost. It's impossible to work, impossible to study. We hope to meet our needs today, not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow. In Syria, I was responsible to my parents, now I am responsible for them. I dreamed of being a teacher, but because my parents are old, I must try each week just to protect them, to cover their basic needs of shelter, food and medicine. I needed some way to support my family. While most Syrians are not permitted to work, we can volunteer. I found a role with the poverty-fighting organization CARE in the urban refugee center in East Amman, Jordan, where I earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work. I have enjoyed it so much. After working there, I have become more social, and no longer feel isolated. It's not like sitting at home, feeling powerless, losing confidence, wondering what I can do to help my family, to help my people. Instead, I feel empowered. I recognize my potential. And, because of that, I refuse to give up on my dreams. My hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so I can continue my studies. I want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching Syrian children. Resettling could help shape my future so that I can help shape theirs. One day, I will tell them of the crisis we faced in the Syria that I left. We must be aware of this history, and learn from it. We must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard. Change starts with them. And it starts with us. Each person has the right to pursue an education, to meet their most basic needs, to express themselves. When those rights are stifled, so, too, is a person's potential, her opportunities, her power to create a better world, and in my case, a better Syria. My question to the U.S. people and the international community is this: Imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours: What do you believe in then? What do you cling to? The answer, I think, is: your dreams. We all have them. Mine, for the time being, have been deferred.

Article text: New Zealand coach Steve Hansen flew out of Dublin three weeks ago bemoaning boring European rugby. After Saturday’s spectacular conclusion to the 2015 Six Nations, you hope his television wasn’t on the blink at his home in Christchurch and that he caught every single second of an engrossing 240 minutes spread across the three round five matches. It was breathtaking. The three teams who entered denouement day on six points apiece — England with a +37 points difference, Ireland +33 and Wales +12 — all wound up on eight points each but with one crucial photo finish difference — Ireland’s calculus was revised upwards to +63, six better than England’s +57 and 10 clear of Wales’ +53. Mere numbers, though, can’t properly tell the tale of this nerve-shredding afternoon where credit must go to Wales for transforming a slender 14-13 interval lead in Rome into the 61-20 thrashing and igniting the subsequent thirst for points at Murrayfield and Twickenham. Jonny Sexton (left) and Paul O'Connell (right) arrive at Dublin Airport with the trophy fully in their grasp . Ireland's fans got a chance to touch the coveted Six Nations trophy outside Dublin Airport . When it all ended, with England a metre short of the French line in forlorn search of the title-clinching converted try, Hansen’s eyes should have been watering with the wonder of it all. Boring? No way. A whopping 27 tries — after just 36 in the four previous rounds’ dozen games — in a 221-point attacking rugby harvest. Amazing. Pivotal moments were numerous. With eight-try Wales 48 points clear of Italy, a margin that would have set Ireland the target of a 28-point win in Edinburgh, a vital late twist had the air of 2007 revisited (Italy scored a late try eight years ago to cut Ireland’s margin and France won the title by a points difference of +4). Azzurri winger Leonardo Sarto proved unstoppable from his 10-metre line, touching down on 79:24 for the converted try that saw Ireland’s desired goal suddenly become a more manageable 21. Rob Kearney (centre) holds the Six Nations trophy in front of a mixture of youthful and experienced fans . Having scored just four tries in 320 minutes, they doubled that tally through Paul O’Connell’s fifth-minute opener and Sean O’Brien’s 25th and 72nd-minute brace either side of Jared Payne’s 50th-minute effort. Then, Jamie Heaslip won a seemingly lost cause, marvellously knocking the ball from Stuart Hogg as he went to ground for a consolation Scotland try. It set England the chase of a 26-point victory and they fell short, referee Nigel Owens penalising them on 80:12 at a ruck for sealing off. Ireland were champions and it was just as well. If England had pounced for that deciding converted try, the finger of blame would have been pointed in Scotland at both Johnny Sexton and Ian Madigan. With Ireland 20 points ahead and needing another score to jump ahead of Wales on the table, Sexton inexplicably missed two penalty kicks in quick succession. Jamie Heaslip (centre) poses for a photograph with a young fan after returning to Ireland . The first effort, from in front of the posts close in, collided with an upright and the second, from the 10-metre line, drifted wide to the right. He eventually recomposed himself, landing the pole-taking penalty on 62 minutes before signing off nine minutes later with cramp having energetically applied pressure to earn the lineout that was a foundation for the revitalised O’Brien’ s second try. There was still time for another sloppy penalty miss, a nervous Madigan pulling his close-in attempt to the left, but it would have been cruel had this hat-trick of missed penalties come back to haunt them a few hours later. Unlike Wales, who needed a last-second penalty to secure a one-point Stadio Olimpico half-time lead, and unlike England, 15-10 in arrears until the 27th minute in London, Ireland hit the front early and resolutely stayed there against the winless Scots, their only defensive aberration being Rob Kearney’s error which left Robbie Henshaw defending a three-on-one overlap down the blindside of the ruck for Finn Russell’s converted try on the half hour. Ireland were crowned Six Nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge England and Wales . Other than this repeated weakness in shackling breakdown ball quickly shifted from right to left (France and Wales scored against them in the same corner and England came within a whisker of doing the same), Ireland fixed the issues that betrayed them in Wales. They didn’t get stuck at the Murrayfield ruck, didn’t start lethargically, didn’ t trail by a dozen points 14 minutes in due to poor indiscipline, didn’t tactically kick inaccurately and didn’t blow up damagingly at the lineout due to talismanic O’Connell taking on the responsibility of calling a plethora of ball on himself. Exuding pride in his team’s resilience to overcome the disappointment of blowing their Grand Slam chance, Joe Schmidt hailed his skipper for grabbing the team by the scruff of the neck post–Wales and engineering the title-winning response. Ireland powered to a 40-10 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield that won them the Six Nations title . England beat France 55-35 at Twickenham but it wasn't enough to overhaul Ireland . ‘You could see them starting to bounce back on Thursday. I texted the players on Tuesday and just said, “Training wasn’t flash today but get a day’s rest and let’s start from scratch on Thursday and really launch ourselves into this last challenge”,’ he said. That 24-word missive had the desired effect. ‘You know when you ask something of them they are going to give it their very best shot. It’s funny, we took a fair bit of confidence out of Cardiff. ‘You give Wales a 12-point head start, a Lions pack team, get to within four and really put pressure on them — that in its own way gave us a little bit of confidence even though we didn’t get the result.’ Seven days later, that Grand Slam-destroying outcome was forgotten. Ireland were back-to-back champions for the first time in 66 years and their spontaneous celebrations, just like the calibre of their rugby, were anything but boring and anything but one dimensional.

Article text: A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU. The unnamed man, who is in his 60s, was one of thousands of Western men who visit Russia every year to find love. It is not known where or how he met his young wife, but he assumed that she would not be allowed into the EU without a visa. A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU (file picture) Because of these fears, he 'folded' her into a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train as he set off back to Nice, in southern France. At Terespol station, on the border between Poland and Belarus, the woman was found by immigration officials, who immediately arrested the couple. After searching the suitcase, Polish customs spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'The Russian wife of the owner of the bag was inside.' There were initial fears that she might have been kidnapped or abused in some other way, however it became clear that she was fine. Mr Sienicki added: 'She was in good shape and wasn't in need of any medical attention.' Despite this, the arrests were deemed valid because the couple had attempted to avoid border controls, which is a criminal offence. The newly-married couple were on their way back to Nice (pictured), France, when their bizarre ploy was rumbled . The wives of men with EU passports can  travel wherever they like in the EU, so if the woman had simply sat next to her husband there would have been no problem. The Russian bride was said to be in her thirties and extremely supple, making it relatively easy for her to fit inside the suitcase. The couple had risked a three-year jail sentence by attempting to evade border control. Mr Sienicki said: 'This was the first time I've seen someone travel like this. She very well could have been a victim of human trafficking.' The couple were eventually released after questioning and were allowed to carry on with their journey.

Red Bull, Williams, and then you're hoping that it's a bit of a better year for those like McLaren and Ferrari, so that we have more people to race. The more the merrier. 'There was one year the first seven races were won by a different driver, a different team, that's what people want to see. But, most importantly, if the cars are close you can have real races where you're overtaking and battling and that's what I love doing. That's what racing's about.'

Article text: A millionaire hospital executive stabbed to death his wife then set fire to their New Jersey home in a murder-suicide, officials have ruled - despite the couple's children insisting they were both murdered. John Sheridan, 72, the CEO of Cooper Health System, and his 69-year-old wife, Joyce Sheridan, were found dead, with seven stab wounds between them, in their blazing Skillman house last September. Mrs Sheridan, a retired high school teacher, died from a stab wound to her chest, while her husband, an ally of state governor Chris Christie, passed away from 'sharp force injuries' and smoke inhalation. On Friday, prosecutors ruled Mr Sheridan had attacked his wife with a knife in the seconds leading up to their deaths, which occurred just a day after the couple had decorated their home for Halloween. 'Murder-suicide': John Sheridan (left), 72 ,stabbed to death his wife, Joyce (right), 69, then set fire to their home in a murder-suicide, officials have ruled - despite the couple's children insisting they were murdered . Crime scene: Mr Sheridan, the millionaire CEO of Cooper Health System, and his wife were found dead, with seven stab wounds between them, in their blazing Skillman, New Jersey, house (pictured) last September . Mrs Sheridan suffered eight wounds to her head, a stab injury to her chest that 'perforated her aorta', wounds to her hands that were 'characterized as defensive in nature' and bruising, officials said. She was ruled to have died before the fire started  on September 28. After killing his wife of 47 years with a 'carving-type knife', Mr Sheridan then doused the room with gasoline and set it alight, it is said. Mr Sheridan finally stabbed himself with a sharp item three times in the torso and neck area, causing a 'small perforation to the right jugular vein', prosecutors ruled. He was then overcome by thick smoke. Despite the murder-suicide ruling, announced by Somerset County Prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano on Friday, the four grown sons of the Sheridans have released a statement challenging the findings. The men, including Mark Sheridan, who is a prominent Republican election law lawyer, said they were not satisfied with the result of the investigation and still don't know who killed their parents. 'The conclusion announced today fails to provide those answers,' the sons' statement said. Connections: Mr Sheridan (left) is pictured with, from left, George Norcross III, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Dr. Paul Katz during an event in 2012. He was an influential member of the Republican party . Revelation: On Friday, prosecutors said in a statement (pictured) that Mr Sheridan had fatally stabbed his wife on the day of their deaths, which occurred just a day after they had decorated their home for Halloween . 'It is nothing more than an expedient way for the Prosecutor's Office to close its file and put an end to its embarrassing bungling of this murder investigation in the hope that our family, the citizens of Somerset County and the press will stop inquiring about what actually happened. Authorities discovered the Sheridans' bodies in their master bedroom after responding to a report of a fire  shortly before 6.15am. Mr Sheridan was found lying face-up at the foot of the couple's bed. The top portion of a two piece, armoire dresser was discovered resting on his body, according to officials. Seconds later, Mrs Sheridan was found lying face-up on the floor to the left of the bed. The wealthy couple did not leave behind a will, while two knives were found in the master bedroom near their bodies. Following the grim discoveries, Soriano's office spent six months investigating. Damaged: After killing his wife with a 'carving-type knife', Mr Sheridan set fire to their home with gasoline and matches, it is said. Above, a police vehicle is seen stationed outside the burned property on September 29 . Police at the scene: Mr Sheridan finally stabbed himself with a sharp item three times in the torso and neck area, causing a 'small perforation to the right jugular vein', officials ruled. He was then overcome by smoke . On  Friday, the office said some of the 180 interviews carried out during the investigation had revealed Mr Sheridan had been withdrawn and acting unusually in the days before the deaths. He was described as being 'out of character', 'very upset' and with 'an attitude of resignation'. The investigation also found no signs of a break-in at the Montgomery County home, officials said. However, the couple's sons have argued some key evidence is missing in the case. The Sheridans owned two homes - the $512,000 property where the fire unfolded and another in New York. Mr Sheridan was president and CEO of Camden-based Cooper University Health Care, which has more than 700 physicians and serves more than half a million patients a year, when he died. Memorial service: The couple's joint memorial service drew hundreds of mourners including Gov Christie and four of his predecessors, ex-governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco . Last year, NJBiz valued his company at $913million. Mr Sheridan, a Republican, was also an important political figure who served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The couple's joint memorial service drew hundreds of mourners including Gov Christie and four of his predecessors, ex-governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco. As well as their four sons, the Sheridans left behind three grandchildren. In a case unrelated to the fire, one of the sons, Matthew Sheridan, 40, was arrested hours after their deaths for cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia found in his car. Prosecutors have not yet pursued the charges against Mr Sheridan, but have five years to do so.

Article text: It was only fitting that a former Hearts man should help to finally send the Championship title to Tynecastle. After all, this entire season deserves to be coloured maroon. Yet it was not only a favour to his first love that Lee Wallace performed at Easter Road. In scoring the crucial, confidence-building opening goal for Rangers, he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers. For the Ibrox side, games against Hibernian this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture. Three successive defeats had delivered a crushing 9-1 aggregate. One more on Sunday and it was an historic clean sweep. It would also have delayed Hearts’ inevitable coronation for at least another six days. Lee Wallace (centre) is congratulated by his team-mates after giving Rangers the lead away to Hibernian . Hibernian XI: Oxley, Gray (Watson - 45), Hanlon, Fontaine. Stevenson, Fyvie, Robertson (Stanton - 78), MGeouch, Allan, Malonga, Dja Djedje (Boyle - 69) Subs not used: Forster, Craig, Handling, Perntreou . Booked: Gray . Rangers XI: Bell, McGregor, McCulloch, Mohsni, Zaliukas, Wallace; Murdoch, Law, Shiels (Black - 75); Clark, Miller (Vuckic - 83) Subs not used: Robinson, Hutton, Black, Daly, Templeton, Sinnamon . Goals: Wallace 44, Miller 80 . Booked: Murdoch, Miller . Wallace, though, had different ideas. Freed to attack almost at will in a new 3-5-2 formation set up by Stuart McCall, he delivered a barnstorming display on the left flank. After speaking so openly on Friday about how this had been a season of professional and personal torment, here was an emphatic reminder of just how forceful a player he can be. Others in blue followed his lead. Kenny Miller scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end — when refereeing headline-magnet Willie Collum ignored Hibs’ claims for a foul by Wallace — but, in truth, this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick-off. So often in recent times, Rangers fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area. McCall, though, turned up in Leith and did a number on Hibs to secure the first triumph of his three-match reign. It did not go unnoticed. Kenny Miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for Rangers and close the gap on Hibernian . ‘Stuart McCall’s blue-and-white army’ was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down. McCall’s hopes of remaining in situ beyond the end of the season may well hinge on winning promotion. If that is to become a reality, then he will need many more days like this one. Overall, this was just a second win in 10 games for Rangers but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts, with a game in hand. They now have renewed hope of finishing second and reducing their play-off schedule in the fight to follow Hearts up. Hibs’ 15-match unbeaten run is at an end but Stubbs is adamant this will not derail the momentum they have steadily built since the turn of the year. Building momentum is now McCall’s (pictured) aim — after he recognised something different had to be attempted against Hibs if Rangers were not to face the inevitably of yet another defeat. His ploy was to move to three centre-backs, with Marius Zaliukas and Bilel Mohsni flanking captain Lee McCulloch. It was hardly a trio to inspire confidence in the visiting support, given their ropey individual performances this term, yet the hope was that weight of numbers would help stifle the hosts in central areas and allow Darren McGregor and Wallace to advance as wing-backs. It worked, and contributed to a fractured opening period in which clear sights of goal were at a premium. Wallace slams home the opener just before half-time to put the away side in control at Easter Road . The Easter Road side had the first, thanks to a majestic, deep cross hit with pace and accuracy from the left flank by Dylan McGeouch. Liam Fontaine had remained upfield from an earlier free-kick but couldn’t cash in on that gamble as he powered a header wide of target. That was, though, as good as it got for Hibs in the first half as they encountered a Rangers line-up displaying a renewed level of organisation. That such a trait was noticeable says much about what went before. It wasn’t bringing about a huge amount in the way of free-flowing entertainment but this at least now looked more like a toe-to-toe contest between well-matched opponents. Nicky Law set up Dean Shiels — back on his old stomping ground — to slice one over the top from the fringe of the penalty area. Then David Gray was caught out as Rangers broke forward and was forced to haul down Wallace around 25 yards out. Collum punished him with a yellow card before Law stepped up to whip the resultant free-kick a couple of feet too high. A couple of set-piece exchanges then caused flickers of threat at either end. It would, though, be the visitors who took the lead two minutes ahead of the interval via a goal made possible by McCall’s rejig. The move started at the feet of the oft-mocked Mohsni, who had the presence of mind to spot that Gray was out of position. A long, raking pass found Nicky Clark scampering into the space he had left behind. Clark stepped on the brakes to switch to his right foot and sling a cross along the six-yard line. Kenny Miller couldn’t connect with a little attempted back-flick before McGregor was denied by a terrific blocking challenge from Lewis Stevenson. The ball broke loose and Wallace, who had stormed into the area to support his fellow wing-back, managed to scoop a shot high into the net despite desperate attempts to close him down. Kenny Miller celebrates his goal with the fans during his side's win . It was the first time Rangers had taken the lead against Hibs on Championship duty and only the second goal they had managed during 313 minutes of this fixture. The question was whether they could hold onto the advantage they had finally gained. Stubbs sought to fix one fault in his set-up when he replaced the injured Gray, who had endured a pretty difficult first half, with Keith Watson. Yet the pattern of play remained similar after the restart. It was tense, often scrappy, and with the Ibrox side winning marginally more of the numerous little battles. The game found fresh impetus after the hour-mark, however, as each side let slip a prime opportunity. It was Rangers up first, with Mohnsi feeding Miller, whose angled ball set up Clark. He couldn’t sort out his feet quick enough, allowing paul Hanlon to block the strike. Seconds later, Franck Dja Djedje found himself clear in the inside-right channel after the visiting defence was caught out. The angled shot was on, but Dja Djedje tried to square for sidekick Dominique Malonga and Zaliukas intercepted. At last, there was a stretched, open look to the game. Clark was denied space to finish at the near post after another surging run from Wallace. Hibs looked to press back but saw their hopes extinguished in rancorous fashion. Wallace looked to play a one-two with Miller, but it seemed Hanlon had beaten him to the return pass before they collided. The centre-back crashed to the deck claiming a foul, before Easter Road erupted in astonished fury as Collum waved play on. The rest of the home defence seemed to freeze, expecting the free-kick, but Miller was unperturbed as he gathered possession before cracking a shot past Mark Oxley.

Article text: Fiona Cullum is facing jail after she sheltered one of the killers of an innocent nursery teacher hours after she was gunned down as she celebrated her 24th birthday . A mother who sheltered one of the killers of an innocent nursery teacher hours after she was gunned down while celebrating  her 24th birthday is facing jail. Fiona Cullum, 25, provided cover for Hassan Hussain, 30, as he and fellow murderer Yassin James, 20, were hunted by police. She also lied when asked by police about Hussain after he was arrested on 2 October 2013 over the murder of Sabrina Moss on Kilburn High Road, northwest London. The men sprayed bullets at a bar while mother-of-one Miss Moss and her friends sheltered from the rain in their party dresses. Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, was lucky to survive after being blasted in the back with a sawn off shotgun during the attack outside Woody Grill, in South Kilburn. The Old Bailey heard the shooting was part of an ongoing rivalry between gangs in South Kilburn gang and Kensal Green. Hussain, James and their getaway driver Martell Warren, 23, were jailed for a total of 111 years at the Old Bailey last year. Cullum claimed she was so ‘out-of-it’ on drink and drugs she had no idea Hassan was sheltering in her small north London flat. ‘It is at least a possibility that in this sort of state that Hussain entered... and stayed there for however long, entirely without her knowledge, while she was sleeping off the effects of the night before,’ her barrister Rebecca Randall said. But an Old Bailey jury found her guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice for sheltering Hassan and providing a false statement to police. She was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice for sheltering James after the jury could not reach a verdict. She was standing trial alongside Reid Daniel, 24 and Matthew Bouzemada, 22, who were both convicted of assisting getaway driver Martell Warren, 23. Rakheed Daniel, 21, was found not guilty of the same offence. The men sprayed bullets at a bar while mother-of-one Sabrina Moss (left and right) and her friends sheltered from the rain in their party dresses . Her friend Sabrina Gachette, 24, was lucky to survive after being blasted in the back with a sawn off shotgun during the attack outside Woody Grill, in South Kilburn . Ms Gachette punched the air as the verdicts were read out while Bouzemada and Reid Daniel hugged Cullum as they were remanded in custody to be sentenced on 17 March. Judge Stephen Kramer QC told Cullum ‘be under no illusions, the likely sentence is one of custody’ as he bailed her to be sentenced on 10 April. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said: ‘This case is not concerned with who was involved in the plan to seriously harm members of the South Kilburn gang, or the shooting of Sabrina Moss and others when that plan was carried through. ‘This case, rather, is concerned with events after that dreadful incident because in the period immediately following the murder, each of these defendants took steps to assist those responsible for the shooting to evade apprehension and to deny the police evidence relating to Warren in the form of the mobile phones he had been using in the run up to and during the period of the murder, and relating to the car he had been driving.’ Fiona Cullum, 25, provided cover for Hassan Hussain (right), 30, as he and fellow murderer Yassin James (left), 20, were hunted by police . CCTV captured the moment two of the killers walked along the road towards the bar before the shooting unfolded . The grainy footage shows the men standing in the road (centre) and opening fire as people dive for cover . ‘In the case of Fiona Cullum, she provided such assistance to Hussain and James by sheltering them in the hours after the murder when the police investigation on and around Kilburn High Road was at its most intense, and then lied to the police about them when she was spoken to shortly after Hussain and James were arrested.’ She told police she did not remember speaking to Hussain and that he had not been at her address. Two of her co-defendants were found guilty of helping Warren, who fled the country shortly after the murder, to distance himself from two mobiles that tied him to the attack. Reid Daniel passed the phones on to Bouzemada before Warren was arrested on 27 August 2013 as he tried to re-enter the country, but the phones have never been found. She was standing trial alongside Reid Daniel (right), 24 and Matthew Bouzemada (left), 22, who were both convicted of assisting getaway driver Martell Warren, 23 . ‘He [Warren] resolved, as his actions later on 24 August demonstrate, to flee before he was caught and he needed to distance himself from those items, his phone and car, so that he could do so,’ said Mr Atkinson. ‘Equally Hussain and James had used two firearms with an intention to kill.. ‘Although hooded when they approached the group, of which Sabrina Moss and Sabrina Gachette were a part, there was clearly a risk that they might have been recognised or that they might be connected to the Vauxhall Corsa. ‘It would clearly have been prudent for them to know whether they were now police targets before returning to their normal address.’ Cullum, of St Johns Wood, north London, denied harbouring Hussain and James and making a false statement to police. She denied three charges of perverting the course of justice. Bouzemada, of  Harlesden, Reid Daniel, of Hayes, and Rakheed Daniel, of Willesden, denied perverting the course of justice by concealing or destroying Warren’s phones. Warren, of Kensal Green, northwest London, Hussain, of Willesden Green, northwest London, and James, of Wembley, northwest London, were previously convicted of murder and attempted murder.

Article text: A Silicon Valley venture capital firm has emerged victorious from a three-year high profile case accusing executives of gender discrimination. Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao, 45, sued her former employer Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for four counts of discrimination after she was fired. In a case that prompted a broad discussion about gender bias in the tech industry, Pao painted the firm as sexist, crude, and quarrelsome. On Friday, a jury of six men and six women rejected every claim after less than 72 hours of deliberation in San Francisco Superior Court. Scroll down for video . Lost: Ellen Pao (pictured after the verdict) sued her former employers for four counts of gender bias after she was fired. The Reddit CEO claimed her career crumbled at Kleiner after ending an affair with a partner . A jury of six men and six women rejected all of Pao's claims in San Francisco Superior Court on Friday . Over the course of three years, Pao told the court her career at the Silicon Valley firm crumbled after she ended a brief affair with partner Ajit Nazre, and was fired in 2012 when she complained. Pao, who is married to Wall Street financier Alphonse Fletcher Jr, said he 'falsely told her that his wife had left him' and 'engaged in offensive, obstructionist, and difficult behavior' until she 'succumbed' two or three times. After she ended the liaison, he started to 'retaliate', she claimed. At one point, she said, Nazre appeared at her colleague's hotel room on a business trip wearing nothing but a bathrobe, carrying a glass of wine, according to testimony. The court heard Ray Lane, a former partner, said the woman, Trae Vassallo, should have been 'flattered'. Kleiner countered that it investigated Nazre after Vassallo complained, after which he quickly left the firm. Pao's first claim, tabled in 2007, also accused senior partner Randy Komisar of giving her a Leonard Cohen book, Book Of Longing, filled with sexually explicit drawings and poems. Later, he asked her to dinner adding that 'his wife would be out of town'. The case played out as Silicon Valley saw a steady decline in the number of female venture capitalists. Recent figures collected by Babson College show six per cent of the venture capital is female, down from 10 per cent in 1999. With that backdrop, Pao's lawyers described Kleiner as a pressure cooker that was hostile toward women. One of Pao's mentors testified that subpar performance meant she was not promoted, rather than gender . The firm disputed those charges, presenting evidence that Kleiner went out of its way to hire women. During the case, the court heard one partner, Chi-Hua Chien, said women 'kill the buzz' as he argued only men should be invited to a dinner with Al Gore. John Doerr, once Pao's direct boss, told investigators she had 'a female chip on her shoulder'. And senior partner Ted Schlein rebuffed the feminist rallying call from Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg that women 'deserve a seat at the table'. He said: 'I really don’t think it was a very big deal to us who sits at a table or who does not.' Specifically, Pao alleged that: . The jury ruled against Pao on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount. Two hours later, they emerged in favor of Kleiner Perkins. The court requires a minimum of 9-3 votes to come to a conclusion. But initially, the verdict stated that four jurors supported Pao's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination. On the pivotal claim that Pao was fired for being female, ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor. They came to their conclusion after completing this question-and-answer document. According to Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Elder, Pao looked down and forced a smile as the judge revealed she had lost. Some witnesses, including Pao's onetime mentor John Doerr, testified that Pao's lack of advancement stemmed from subpar performance, not discrimination or retaliation. However, Pao's attorneys argued she played a pivotal role in the investment in RPX and Twitter. Pao testified for five days and faced questions from jurors such as whether it was 'professional to enter into an affair with a married partner?' 'Going back I would not have done it again, but I didn't think it was inappropriate at the time,' Pao said. Following the verdict on Friday, Pao released a statement via Twitter. In nine tweets, she wrote: 'Thank you, world. 'I have been inspired by the thousands of people who have reached out to me over the past three years with support. 'I’ve heard from people in Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Australia, Malaysia, France, Argentina, Norway, Tanzania, Finland, and beyond. 'Because of social media and live reports, the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe . 'While today’s outcome is a disappointment, I take consolation in knowing that people really listened . 'If we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities, things will not change . 'Hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone, including women and minorities . 'To support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, we need to show leadership today. 'And thank you to the team and board @reddit for standing by me.'

Article text: A German professor has been forced to apologise for declining an Indian student's internship because of the 'rape problem' in his country. Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger's response to the application went viral after it was posted online and prompted a wave of indignation, forcing the intervention of Germany's ambassador to India. Her original response to the student's application stated: 'Dear Sir, unfortunately I don't accept any Indian male students for internships. Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger's email (pictured) stated she didn't accept any male Indian students for internships because of the country's 'rape problem' In response German ambassador to India Michael Steiner wrote a letter (pictured) stating he 'strongly objected' to her comments . 'We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female students in my group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support.' This was later posted online, with the professor's and student's names redacted under the title: 'What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women?' Following the outrage which erupted, she backtracked on her comments, stating in an apology posted to Germany's embassy website that she had 'made a mistake' and apologized to 'everyone whose feelings I have hurt'. When her email came to light, ambassador Michael Steiner wrote a scathing letter rebuking her for the comments, stating: 'Let me make it clear at the outset that I strongly object to this.' He added, in reference to a notorious 2012 Dehli gang rape in which a woman died: 'The Nirbhaya case has triggered a lively, honest, sustained and very healthy public debate - a public debate of a quality that wouldn't be possible in many other countries. Germany's India ambassador Michael Steiner (pictured) condemned the professor's comments in an open letter . 'Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offence to these women and men (activists) ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India; and it is an offence to millions of law-abiding, tolerant, open-minded and hard-working Indians. 'Let's be clear: India is not a country of rapists.' In the 2012 case he referenced, the student was savagely attacked by six men including with an iron rod after boarding a private bus on her way home from the cinema with a male friend. The woman, who legally cannot be named, died from her injuries 13 days later. The brutality of the assault and her determination to survive so she could report her attackers to police sparked large-scale street protests. Four of her attackers were convicted and given the death penalty in September after the case was fast-tracked, while a juvenile was sentenced to a correctional facility. Another died in jail after apparently committing suicide. The case sparked soul-searching about India's treatment of women and also led to initiatives to educate men about respect and equal gender rights in the deeply patriarchal country.

Article text: Germaine Greer delivered an awkward moment on Q&A program on Monday night when she asked Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop if she would 'free the nipple' to save the lives of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman. The social media campaign, which gets its name from the 'free the nipple' hashtag it is associated with, aims to address the taboo surrounding women's nipples being exposed in film, television and photographs. It was raised by an audience member who was interested in learning the panel's view of how they felt about young women posing topless online. Scroll down for video . Feminist icon Germaine Greer asked Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop if she would consider posing topless to spare the Bali Nine duo . While Ms Bishop said it was not something she had ever had the desire to do and emojis were as 'radical' as she would get, the controversial feminist icon asked: 'What if it got you the commutation of two life sentences of two Australians?' In reply to this, Ms Bishop paused and shook her head in silence as the audience and panelists on the ABC program laughed. 'Please don't got there, Germaine,' the minister finally answered. This is Greer's second gaffe on the program. In 2012, the feminist icon said former prime minister Julia Gillard had a 'big arse'. Ms Bishop went on to say she was concerned about the concept of young women posting topless photos of themselves on the internet. Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukuraman (right) were sentenced to death after they were caught trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin in 2005 from Indonesia into Australia . Ms Bishop looked shocked when Greer quizzed her on the possibility and was speechless for a few moments . 'I just worry that the liberation of young women showing their nipple to the world leads to some perverted behaviour coming even more to the fore,' she said. Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman were arrested in 2005 for attempting to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin from Indonesia into Australia. Q&A viewers were as stunned as Julie Bishop when Ms Greer asked the question and took to Twitter to express their surprise. Some viewers joked that Ms Bishop should join the 'free the nipple' movement on the spot. The pair were sentenced to death and have spent the last 10 years in Bali's Kerobokan prison. Chan and Sukuraman are days away from being executed after they were moved to Indonesia's 'Death Island', Nusakambangan, on Wednesday. Ms Bishop has repeatedly asked the Indonesia government to spare the duo's lives. It was revealed last week that Ms Bishop tried to organise a prisoners swap in exchange for clemency. Annabel Crabb (left) hosted Monday's show in the place of Tony Jones, with writer Roxane Gay on the panel . Ms Bishop, along with Greer, was appearing on Q&A's first all-female panel to mark Sunday's International Women's Day. Other guests were writer Roxane Gay, Best & Less chief executive Holly Kramer and Youth Without Borders founder Yassmin Abdel-Magied. The show's regular host Tony Jones was replaced by the ABC's chief online political writer Annabel Crabb. Youth Without Borders founder Yassmin Abdel-Magied (left) and Best & Less chief executive Holly Kramer (right) were also very active on the panel . Ms Bishop also discussed the role of being foreign affairs minister and the challenges she would have faced if she had children while in the position. The minister said she spent a number of days over in the Ukraine following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which would have been difficult to maneuver if she had been children. 'I'm not suggesting for a moment that every person who's foreign minister should have no children,' she said. 'But the way I'm doing it, the way I fulfill the role as foreign minister, I do spend a lot of time away and I do focus 110 per cent on it.' .

Article text: A hiker has revealed the toll a 2,650-mile trek had on his body by snapping a selfie mile-by-mile. Andy Davidhazy, 47, from Texas, embarked on the mighty Pacific Crest Trail in 2013 and spent five-and-a-half months zigzagging his way from Mexico to Canada. During his journey he lost 50lbs as he walked his way through five pairs of shoes. His complexion also got all the more rugged as he experienced undulating temperatures, weather, and terrain.

Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Andy Davidhazy, 47, from Texas, embarked on the mighty Pacific Crest Trail in 2013 and spent five-and-a-half months zigzagging his way from Mexico to Canada - he took a selfie mile-by-mile to document his transformation . Slimming down: During his journey he lost 50lbs as he walked his way through five pairs of shoes . Bearded man: His complexion also got all the more rugged as he experienced undulating temperatures, weather, and terrain . At the starting point Davidhazy appears slightly chubby-cheeked with his hair neatly cut. But as the miles go on, the stubble begins to grow and Davidhazy's face gets increasingly gaunter. At one point he appears with a full beard and in another shot he seems to have a touch of sunburn. The selfies also reveal several of Davidhazy's must-have items. In almost all of the images a water bottle appears attached to his rucksack strap. In hotter climates, the hat and sunglasses come out and in rainier climates an anorak comes into play. In some scenes other trekkers are seen lurking in the background but for the most-part Davidhazy appears alone. In a bid to keep his sanity, it appears Davidhazy listened to music as in several selfies headphones are seen plugged into his ears. Davidhazy said that he actually completed the Pacific Crest Trail in two stages as snow prevented him from doing it in one go. He stopped at mile 2,424 and took a detour leading him back around to a trailhead.

'It provided a good conversation starter with so many hikers that I would meet along the way,' he said of his photo ritual. 'And I now love seeing so many wonderful faces popping up in pictures in unexpected places.' Davidhazy kept track of where he was using paper maps, a mobile app with GPS and a watch. After a while, he found a mile generally took him 18 to 22 minutes to hike. During his mammoth walk, Davidhazy said he encountered one wolf, five black bears, dozens of rattlesnakes and countless creepy crawlies. He now plans to make a feature film documenting his life-changing trip, called Lost or Found. Summing up the voyage he said: 'It was the hardest simple thing I could think of.'

Article text: Microsoft has confirmed that it is dropping the Internet Explorer brand. The move was rumoured in December but now the Redmond-based tech giant has said it will use a new name for its forthcoming browser, which is currently code named Project Spartan. It is believed the new browser will look more like Google's Chrome browser and be faster than Internet Explorer. Scroll down for video . Farewell familiar friend: Microsoft has confirmed that it is dropping the Internet Explorer brand (logo pictured) and instead will use a new name for its forthcoming browser, which is currently code named Project Spartan . Microsoft's marketing chief Chris Capossela said the company is working on a new name for the browser, which should be in Windows 10. ‘We’ll continue to have Internet Explorer, but we’ll also have a new browser which is code named Project Spartan. We have to name the thing,’ he said at Microsoft Convergence. The new browser will be the main way for Microsoft 10 users to access the internet, although Internet Explorer will continue to exist, The Verge reported. The re-branding move is unsurprising as Microsoft has tried and largely failed to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure and has regularly made ‘worst tech products of all time’ lists. The browser, which does not yet have a name, is likely to be rolled out with Windows 10. The new operating system marks the return of the Start Menu, which has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8 (pictured) The company is thought to be testing names using market research, but so far no final name has been announced. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995. Internet Explorer was one of the most widely used web browsers, attaining a peak of about 95 per cent during 2002 and 2003. However, it struggled in the face of competition, and in May 2012 it was announced that Google's Chrome overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser worldwide. The brand has struggled to shake off the bad reputation of Internet Explorer 6, which was notoriously insecure. Capossela mentioned that putting ‘Microsoft’ in front of the secret name boosted the browser’s appeal to some Chrome users in the UK, suggesting the company’s name could appear in the final brand. Mary Jo Foley of ZDNet first shared the rumour of a new browser in December. 'Microsoft is building a new browser, codenamed Spartan, which is not IE 12 - at least according to a couple of sources of mine,' she wrote. Thomas Nigro, a Microsoft Student Partner lead and developer of the modern version of VLC - a media playing app - claimed on Twitter in December that he heard Microsoft was building a brand-new browser. 'However, if my sources are right, Spartan is not IE 12. 'Instead, Spartan is a new, light-weight browser Microsoft is building.' It is believed Windows 10 will ship with both Spartan and IE 11 to ensure compatibility with all web sites. Microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of Windows. Internet Explorer, which was first called Windows Internet Explorer, was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 in 1995, but since then it has gained a lacklustre reputation. A stock image showing the software package in 1998 is pictured . New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'. Various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8. Users can create multiple desktops to keep things organised. Last year, it was derided for 'missing one' when it announced  it has decided to jump straight to version 10 of its Windows software in a bid to convince consumers the software is different from current versions. The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco. It admitted the software was 'at a threshold' after the poorly received Windows 8. Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief said: 'There's about one and a half billion people using Windows today. 'Devices outnumber people. 'Windows is at a threshold and now it's time for a new Windows. 'Our new Windows must be built from the ground up for a mobile first, cloud first world. 'It wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9.' Microsoft said its new operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever' and will see various app stores merged into one platform, called the One Store. Last year, Terry Myerson, Microsoft's Windows chief, explained how Windows 10 will work on everything from a desktop computer to a smartphone - and even the firm's XBox One games console . The new software will also allow users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes (pictured) The new Start Menu has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface, combined with the tile set-up that Microsoft introduced in Windows 8. Mr Belfiore demonstrated how the new tiles in the new menu can be personalised and re-sized. This will cover all of the company's smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. Myerson said Windows 10 will be 'a whole new generation' and, as expected, works across a variety of devices - from phones to gaming consoles. It also sees the return of the Start Menu, which had been removed from Windows 8 to many users' annoyance. In addition to offering a list of a user's favourite applications, the menu brings up re-sizable tiles - similar to those featured in Windows 8's touch-centric interface - on PCs and tablets. The current version, Windows 8, has been widely derided for forcing radical behavioral changes. Microsoft is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that Windows 10 will be familiar for users regardless of which version of Windows they are now using. 'Windows 10 will deliver the right experience, at the right time. 'Windows 10 will be our most comprehensive platform, ever,' said Mr Myerson. 'We're delivering one application platform. One store, one way for applications to be discovered, purchased, and updated across all of these devices.' The firm announced the latest version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 10, at an event in San Francisco in December. It will run on tablets, phones , desktop computers and even the firm's Xbox games console - and come with a yet-to-be-named browser . Industry experts have been having their say on Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, which was announced at an event in California in December 2014. Many see the upgrade as being the first steps towards righting the unpopular changes made in the company's previous desktop software, Windows 8, and that is reflected in industry reaction. Stuart Miles, founder of technology website Pocket Lint said: 'The initial reaction is that Microsoft had introduced some really good features that will appeal to many and fix many of the annoyances of Windows 8. 'It looks like they are doing everything they can to make amends for the mistakes of Windows 8, but with a long lead time and many unanswered questions like release and price, there is still much left to learn. 'That said it looks to be a good move from the Redmond based company and one that will benefit many.' Geoff Blaber of technology analysts CCS Insights also noted the need for Microsoft to regain support after Windows 8. 'Windows 10 is the product of a difficult Windows 8 launch and a process of refinement based on vocal user feedback. Microsoft will hope that this marks a fresh start that will convince developers, enterprise and consumers of its One Windows strategy', he said. 'With Windows 10 Microsoft has re-evaluated its approach to software releases by adopting a web mentality that dovetails with the Cloud first, mobile first vision under Satya Nadella. This open, collaborative approach is critical if Microsoft is to overcome the wave of negative sentiment that has plagued Windows 8 since launch. 'The unveiling of Windows 10 is notable for its emphasis on enterprise. This dialling up of corporate versus consumer functionality is much needed not least because enterprise replacements are driving PC market growth. 'Developers are the lifeblood of any platform so it is critical that Microsoft's 'One Windows' mantra delvers on the promise and re-energises developer engagement.' Windows 10 is designed to bring together all of Microsoft's different hardware, such as a the surface tablet (left) and the Xbox One (right) under the same software . Across desktop PCs as a whole, only 13.4 per cent currently run Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, according to research firm NetMarketshare. By contrast, it says 51.2 per cent are powered by Windows 7 and 23.9 per cent by Windows XP, a version that is no longer supported by Microsoft. The start menu in Windows 10 will appear similar to what's found in Windows 7, but tiles opening to the side will resemble what's found in Windows 8. Joe Belfiore, a Microsoft executive who oversees Windows design and evolution, said Windows 10 will offer 'the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the benefits that exist in Windows 8' to help business users make the transition. Belfiore said that the company was going 'back to basics' with Windows 10, and confirmed that the famous Start menu, which was removed from Windows 8, would be returning. 'We're looking to find the balance, so that all the Windows 7 users get a familiar experience on the devices they already have,' he said. 'It gives the familiarity of Windows 7 with some of the elements of Windows 8.' He said that going from Windows 8 to Windows 10 is like going from a Prius to a Tesla. 'They don't have to learn any new way to drive.' Mr Belfiore also confirmed that Windows 10 would be compatible with both traditional and touch-based device users like tablets through a new task view with buttons scaled up so that they're more friendly to those on touchscreen devices. Users on hybrid devices like the Surface Pro tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes, with Microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do. Although the new software won't be formally released until later this year, analysts have already said that its success is crucial for Microsoft and new CEO Satya Nadella.

Article text: An audacious raid on two armoured trucks on a busy motorway was last night being linked to a notorious gang known as the Pink Panthers. Jewels worth at least £7million were stolen by armed robbers who struck yesterday at a toll booth on the route linking Paris to the South of France. The daring raid took place just after midnight as the security trucks approached the toll at Avallon in Burgundy, 125 miles south-east of Paris on the A6. Burnt-out vehicles are seen after a group of battle-hardened armed thieves attacked two heavily guarded vans carrying jewels . Authorities are combing the Yonne region in Burgundy southeast of Paris and surrounding areas for the attackers (file picture) The robbery took place on the A6 highway connecting Paris and Lyon . The A6 is a major route connecting the north and south of the country . As they slowed for the barrier, four cars forced them to a halt and up to 15 robbers appeared wearing balaclavas and brandishing automatic weapons. They used gas sprays to knock out the two armed guards in each lorry. The guards were pulled from their cabs and dumped by the toll booth. Yesterday's raid bore all the hallmarks of having been carried out by the Pink Panthers, a gang responsible for audacious heists across Europe and beyond over the past two decades. They always wear balaclavas or face masks and use Kalashnikovs and high-powered stolen cars to carry out their spectacular crimes. The Pink Panthers are said to speak several languages and travel on genuine passports issued to other people, but with the photos changed. Many are former soldiers from Eastern Europe. France is their favoured operating ground but they have carried out more than 100 heists across the globe, netting £300million. Cities where they have struck include London, Dubai, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Tokyo. In 2008 a court in Chambery, south-eastern France, found three Serb members of the Pink Panthers guilty of carrying out robberies in Biarritz, Cannes, Courchevel and Saint-Tropez. No shots were fired and the robbers drove off in the security trucks, which belonged to a Paris company and were full of jewels and other valuables. Other gang members escaped in the cars. Prosecutors said much of the raid would have been caught on CCTV. The trucks were found burned out – and empty – four hours later, 20 miles north in a wood in the village of Quenne, just off the A6 near Auxerre. A mechanical digger was discovered with its arm inside one truck, suggesting that the safes on board were transferred to the get-away cars. There were reports that the cars were spotted speeding towards Paris. Police helicopters and other units were scrambled to hunt the gang but by dawn there was no sign. The security guards are being held for questioning. The A6, known as the ‘Motorway of the Sun’ is hugely popular with holidaymakers, and is used by hundreds of thousands of British drivers every year. The methods used in the robbery immediately led to speculation that the Pink Panthers – a notorious gang of criminals from Eastern Europe – had struck again. The gang earned their name in 1993 after stealing a £500,000 diamond from a jewellers in Mayfair, London, and hiding it in a jar of face cream – a tactic copied from the 1963 film The Pink Panther, starring Peter Sellers as the bungling Inspector Clouseau. The film’s title refers to the name of the missing diamond, although a cartoon pink panther appears in the opening and closing credits. The police official says no one was injured in the attack early Wednesday, and the drivers of the two vans were left at the scene unharmed (file picture)

Article text: (CNN)It's time for leaders in Israel and the United States to call off their war of insults before they cause serious, lasting damage.  Heading into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire. The speech itself is a terrible mistake.  Arranging it without prior consultation with the White House was not only an affront to Barack Obama but to the Presidency itself. One would have thought that after all the uproar, Netanyahu would have caught a "cold" and postponed, but now that he plans to go ahead, he should at least give a measured, thoughtful address -- not the barn burner for which he is known.  But let's be clear: he also deserves a respectful hearing in Congress from both sides of the aisle. Blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in America as well as in Israel. This conflict began on a personal level. Those close to Obama and Netanyahu say the two men took an instant dislike years ago and have since descended into loathing one another. Obama, they say, regards Netanyahu as headstrong, bombastic and reckless. Netanyahu sees Obama as weak, unreliable and priggish. The Obama team also accuses Netanyahu of timing his Congressional speech to rally Israeli voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- Bibi as Churchill standing up to the Nazis -- while Netanyahu's team is convinced Obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the Nobel laureate who brought peace. Each thinks the other endangers the future of the world and each has allowed his top lieutenants to viciously attack the other in the press. But in recent months what began as personal antipathy has deepened and widened into a serious split over the best way to head off Iran's aggressive push to become a nuclear power.  The Iranian threat has long been vexing; former Defense Secretary Bob Gates once told me it was the toughest problem he saw in nearly a half century serving of distinguished service in national security.  There are no obvious solutions acceptable to key parties. The Obama administration believes that a compromise agreement with Iran limiting -- but not dismantling -- its nuclear capability is better than to have current talks fall apart, risking an armed showdown.  The Netanyahu government believes the agreement which Obama appears ready to accept will let Iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb. In truth, there is merit to both points of view -- and the devil here is not only in the details but in the very structure of an agreement.  As Obama believes, a negotiated settlement is far preferable to a possible war or learning to live with a nuclear Iran. But what is alarming not only to Israel but to other American friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the U.S. and its partners in the negotiation with Iran (Russia, China, the UK, France, Germany) have made repeated concessions to get an Iranian signature without getting major concessions in return. Consider: The U.S. and Israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that Iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against Teheran.  Leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal, the U.S. is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in Iran -- 6,500 by latest count. Washington and Tel Aviv once talked of an agreement that would last at least 20 years. ​ According to the latest leaks, the agreement may only cover 10 years and then give the Iranians a chance to bust loose.  This is only the beginning of a long litany of differences. In defense of U.S. compromises, Secretary of State John Kerry makes a persuasive point that a temporary agreement reached 18 months ago containing compromises has worked far better than critics have conceded and therefore, those now at the table deserve a benefit of doubt. But administration critics are also right in arguing that the Obama administration seems to be betting that if just given a few years grace, an odious regime which sponsors terrorism across the Middle East will suddenly change spots and become a partner for peace. In times past, American and Israeli leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress.  President Jimmy Carter could barely stand Israeli leader Menachem Begin but they and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat shaped the Camp David accords in 1978. Despite sometimes bitter words during Israel's recent dust-up with Hamas -- especially directed by Israel against Secretary Kerry -- Obama ensured that Israel was well supplied militarily, particularly with the Iron Dome missile defense system that saved countless Israeli lives. But today's rift seems far more perilous.  It is not only personal but substantive and comes at a moment of spreading turmoil across the Middle East.  Israel should remember that America is its best friend in a world where anti-Semitism is once again raising its hideous head.  The United States should appreciate that for Israel, a nuclear Iran could pose instant annihilation. America also has Arab friends in the Middle East who have vital interests here -- friends like Saudi Arabia who, if an agreement is weak, will feel compelled to pursue their own bomb, unleashing a lethal arms race. This is a moment that demands that leaders in both Israel and the United States lower their voices, take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust.  In private talks, they should work hard finding ways to bridge differences between them, starting with creative proposals coming recently from veteran U.S. diplomats. Dennis Ross, for example, argues that if the U.S. could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere, any time in Iran -- and could enshrine in legislation that Iranian violations will bring military action, that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears.  Martin Indyk proposes that, drawing upon ideas embraced by President Clinton in Middle East negotiations 15 years ago, the U.S. could enter a formal treaty with Israel, voted upon by Congress, that would provide a U.S. "nuclear guarantee" to Israel in event of an Iranian breakout. In short, the moment is dire but not hopeless.  What is clearly needed is a cease fire.  Secretary Kerry seemed to be pointing in that direction Sunday when he said Netanyahu is welcome to speak in the U.S. on Tuesday.  Others should now take up the cause, recognizing that our real adversaries are not in Tel Aviv or Washington but among those in Teheran who support terror and mayhem across the Middle East.

And former AC Milan boss Allegri claims the 21-year-old is just suffering from burnout and admits the midfielder must learn to control games without overexerting himself. 'Any player over 40-50 games per season will have moments of fatigue, let alone a 21-year-old who has a lot to learn on how to control games and pace himself throughout 90 minutes,' the coach told reporters. 'I always tell him technique is not enough, he needs to put in a certain type of performance. Youngsters are going to have peaks and troughs, as Alvaro Morata did, on their way to maturity.'

Article text: This is the dramatic moment a brave cyclist chased down three thieves who had just stolen another rider's bike. Alex Sweeting, 25, was riding along the road in Leyton, east London, when he saw a 53-year-old man in cycling gear who had just been shoulder barged off his bike. Mr Sweeting's head camera shows him pedalling madly after the three men at 21mph - as the heart rate monitor he was also wearing reached 164 beats per minute. Scroll down for video . This is the dramatic moment brave cyclist Alex Sweeting chased down three thieves who had just stolen another rider's bike, as the heart rate monitor he was wearing showed his pulse was beating at 164bpm . Keen cyclist Mr Sweeting (pictured), 25, pedalled after the thieves and managed to retrieve the stolen bike . As he shouted at the men, they dropped the bike and sprinted away. Mr Sweeting, a technical production manager at Teradata, told MailOnline: 'It was 10.30pm at night and I had been at work and then at my cycling club (Lea Valley Cycling Club) social at a pub that we have once a month. 'I was cycling home with a mate when we went our separate ways. I was riding home to Barking and I was going quite quickly. 'I then saw a guy running along in cycling shoes, which I thought was a bit odd. 'He flagged me and a bus down and said what had happened and that someone had nicked his bike and I then saw them running off in the distance.' The helmet mounted camera belonging to rider Alex Sweeting, 25, shows the 53-year-old man in cycling gear running along the cycling lane after three thieves pushed him to the ground and stole his bike . With his helmet-mounted camera and heart monitor on, Mr Sweeting raced after the three thieves in Leyton . He added: 'I wasn't thinking much at the time. I just thought "how can I get near them"? 'It was only when I stopped that I realised what I'd done. 'The cyclist then caught back up with me and he was already on the phone to the police. He was obviously really annoyed about what happened, but was glad he got his bike back. He said the bike only cost about £200. 'He was very grateful but said it wasn't the first time it has happened to him in the same area.' Mr Sweeting, a passionate cyclist who travels by bike to work every day, added: 'It angers me that people do this. It could have happened to anyone. You should be able to feel safe on a bike wherever you go, but this was a vicious attack. Pedalling at a top speed of 21mph and with his heart rate at 164 bpm, Mr Sweeting caught up with the thugs . As his speeds ticks over 20mph, Mr Sweeting frantically pedals after the three thieves in the distance . 'I actually got the helmet camera for Christmas because of an incident with a car, so I'm really glad I got it. Hopefully it'll lead to some sort of prosecution or charge.' A police spokesman said the victim - who was making his way towards Wanis Distribution Centre in Orient Way, Leyton - was slightly injured but declined medical attention. Police described how one of the men suddenly charged at the cyclist, causing him to fall off his bike into the road. Another man then punched the victim in the back of the head before a third grabbed the bike and all three ran off. The three men were described as being between 18 and 25 and about 5ft 8ins tall. Two were described as black, while the other appeared to be Asian. Mr Sweeting caught up with the three men on his bike and they dropped the stolen bike before running off . The three thieves discarded the stolen bike as Mr Sweeting caught up with them and then fled on foot . As Mr Sweeting retrieved the stolen bicycle, the three men continued to run away along the track in Leyton . Officers searched the area but the men had escaped. Last month, Alan Cartwright, 15, died after he was stabbed while riding his bike in Islington, North London. The two friends he was with had their bikes stolen during the attack. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to contact Waltham Forest police on 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111 - please quote crime reference number: 4905428/15.

Article text: New parents: Adam Johnson, 27, and Stacey Flounders, 25, have a two-month-old baby, Ayla . The family of a millionaire England footballer say he is 100 per cent innocent and his girlfriend will stand by him after he was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl. Adam Johnson - who was signed by Sunderland for £10million in 2012 - was held by police at his six-bedroom £1.8million home in County Durham. Officers also seized a blank firing pistol during the raid. The arrest comes just weeks after his long-term girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to the couple's first child Ayla Sofia, who was born on January 8. It was unclear if Miss Flounders and her daughter were at home at the time of the player's arrest. And speaking from Miss Flounders' family home, her mother told the Daily Mirror that her daughter and Johnson were still 'very close' and 'absolutely still together'. She added: 'He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him. 'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situtation.' The £50,000-a-week player had been due to travel with the rest of the Sunderland squad to East Yorkshire to prepare for tonight’s Premier League game against Hull City. But the club announced he was suspended, ‘pending the outcome of a police investigation’. The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger who has represented his country 12 times, although he failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year. Residence: Neighbours said they assumed the 27-year-old footballer’s £1.5million property in County Durham (above) had been burgled when they saw activity outside the sprawling mansion . Johnson, 27, gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo’s former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. ‘He liked the attention of being a well-known footballer and attracting women was not a problem,’ said one local, who did not wish to be named. ‘He would often leave his car in the village after a night out as he liked a drink and would always get a taxi home.’ But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Miss Flounders. Friends say Johnson opted to live near a quiet hamlet to get away from the ‘bright lights’ of city life. Footballer: Johnson is currently playing for Sunderland and has made 12 appearances for the England team . Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station. Johnson’s stunning gated property boasts six bedrooms and a sweeping gravel drive and is set in more than two acres of mature woodland. The house is a typical Footballers’ Wives-style property with Italian stone flooring, and a spiral staircase to a mezzanine level. The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom, dressing room and balconies at the front and rear while the other five bedrooms are all en-suite. Left: Johnson was released on bail last night and will return to Peterlee police station (pictured) at a later date . It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough’s youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City before being signed three years ago by Sunderland. Last night a Durham Police spokesman said: ‘A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations. ‘A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.’ Discussions: Adam Johnson (left) is joined by Frank Lampard (centre) while speaking to the Duchess of Cambridge (right) at the England training facility at St George's Park in Burton upon Trent in October 2012 .

Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a £7million move to Manchester City in February 2010. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year.

Article text: French culture minister Felur Pellerin, who has called fro the country to stop blockading English words from entering the French language . France should stop blocking English phrases from entering their language and embrace new words from other nations, the country's culture minister has said. Fleur Pellerin, who was born in South Korea and also speaks fluent English and German, says the French language is not frozen and that the country should be thankful for English words 'enriching' their lexicon. The government's stance marks a dramatic break from France's previous rigid defence of its language, especially from English words entering it. Miss Pellerin said: 'The French language is not frozen. A language is always evolving. 'Some languages - like English today, or Italian in the past - have been particularly generous in offering hundreds of new words to French. 'French is not in danger and my responsibility as minister is not to erect ineffective barriers against languages but to give all our citizens the means to make it live on.' Current French legislation states that all public advertising is in French or at least includes a translation of non-French terms. There was also a campaign to stop terms such as 'e-mail' 'challenge' and 'marketing' from creeping into the French language. But many French linguists have welcomed the minister's comments. Alain Rey, author of a dictionary on the history of French and a member of a Commission on French Terminology, said attempts to stop the adoption of some commonly used words were ridiculous. He pointed out that the word 'challenge', for instance, in fact originally came from Old French ('chalonge') before being taken up in English. 'Passing laws (against loan words) is to tilt at windmills,' Mr Rey said. A woman holds open a copy of the 2015 edition of the French 'Petit Larousse' dictionary. Current French legislation states that all public advertising is in French or at least includes a translation of non-French terms . Miss Pellerin's comments come just months after she admitted that she hasn't read a single book over the past two years, despite being appointed culture minister. To add to her embarrassment, she was also unable to say on a TV show which book by France's Nobel Literature Prize winner Patrick Modiano was her favourite, just minutes after having said she had lunched with the author. Only two weeks beforehand, she had hailed Modiano as representing the 'influence and vitality of French literature in the eyes of the world.'

Article text: After years of battling depression, Fern Britton is now clearly feeling very comfortable in her own skin. Since leaving This Morning, the 57-year-old has carved out a successful career as a novelist alongside her TV work and as she sparkles as this month's Good Housekeeping cover girl. In the interview, Fern talks about how she's over worrying about the signs of ageing: 'My bosoms are dropping? Blah, that's life!' She adds: 'I am vain about being as fit as I can be – not about my wrinkles. I’ve had that conversation with myself about, should I do Botox, should I do this, should I do that – and I’ve talked myself out of it. I’m either going to look odd, or I’m going to look old, and I’d prefer to be the woman I should be. I’m 57, and I look like a 57 year-old, and I’m happy.' Scroll down for video . Presenter and author Fern Britton sparkles as this month's Good Housekeeping cover girl . Touching on the depression that has affected her in the past the presenter admits to feeling angry about it, but says that she's starting to understand it more. She says: 'I haven’t had an episode for a long time. I’m cross that it’s been there and that it lurks around, but I’ve started to understand it more. I reached a stage where I knew when it was coming, hurtling towards me, and I thought, don’t run away, just stand there, brace yourself, and let it happen. 'Because I knew it would pass. People who are going through their first or second episode don’t trust that it will pass – but it really will.' The 57-year-old, who has just written her fifth novel, says that she is over worrying about ageing . Fern and husband TV chef Phil Vickery will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary in May. She says: 'Phil and I have a really, really good relationship – every day we tell each other we love each other – and there are also times when we would cheerfully bash each other as well! 'He’s been a very good father, stepfather and partner to me. He’s the only person who’s ever always been right in my corner. On the day we married he told me, in the car, I will never let you down. That was a vow. And he never has. We’ve had our moments – it wouldn’t be normal if we hadn’t – but we’re very solid.' But life's not always glamorous in the Britton-Vickery household. Fern says: 'I rarely have make-up on when I’m at home. I’m at the Co-op, I’m on the school run, or walking in the woods with Phil and the dog – that’s real life. Phil is a very handsome man, but at home, he walks around mostly just in his pants, without having shaved for a few days! I’m not in the club of people who care about these things – I just don’t care. Fern and Phil, 53, have one daughter, Winnie, 13, and Phil is a stepfather to Fern's other children, twins Harry and Jack, 21, and Grace, 18.. With three children flying the nest it's time for Fern to focus on new challenges and she jokes about a surprise career change, saying: 'I might retrain to be a midwife. I’d love that…' The full interview appears in the May issue of Good Housekeeping on sale 2 April .

Article text: Bobbi Kristina Brown's aunt has claimed that her boyfriend Nick Gordon is being investigated by police for trying to murder her. Leolah Brown wrote on Facebook that her family has 'strong evidence of foul play' relating to the day in January when Brown, 22, was found face-down in a bathtub. She is currently on life support in Atlanta, Georgia. The dramatic claims are part of a long-running family feud between Gordon and other parts of the Brown clan. Leolah made the claims - which she says law enforcement are aware of and following up - in response to Gordon, 25, being invited on the Dr Phil chat show. Life support: Bobbi Kristina Brown, pictured above with Nick Gordon in 2012, was found face-down in a bathtub in January. Gordon has now been sensationally accused of trying to kill her . In a message addressed to host Phil McGraw, she said: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece Bobby Kristina Brown. 'We have strong evidence of foul play. Until this investigation is completed by law enforcement, I would ask that you or anyone else not provide this individual a platform to spin this situation to his benefit. 'If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and/or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece's body was found in a bathtub, he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded.' Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub at the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Police in the town were not immediately able to comment on the attempted murder allegation when contacted by DailyMail.com. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived. Few other details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Leolah kept up the attack in later comments on her Facebook page. She later wrote: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' The show is describing the episode,  due to air March 11, as an 'intervention'. Accusation: Leolah Brown made the accusation in a Facebook post addressed to Phil McGraw, who has filmed a segment with Nick Gordon for the Dr Phil show . Controversial: Bobbi Kristina's aunt attacked Dr Phil, right, for making the forthcoming program with Nick Gordon, left. The episode, pictured above, is yet to air . A spokesman for the show said Gordon and his mother, Michelle, described him as haunted by what happened to Brown and the similar tragedy that befell the late Whitney Houston. Houston was found face-down and unresponsive in about a foot of water in a bathtub in the Beverly Hilton hotel on Feb. 11, 2012, just before the Grammys. On the show, Michelle said: 'As we sit here right now, my son's life hangs in the balance.  When Whitney was found, he administered CPR to her and called me as he was standing in front of her saying, "Mom, why couldn't I do it? I couldn't get air into her lungs." 'He won't let go of the guilt.' Gordon said he has suffered mental anguish and panic attacks since Brown was found, and over Houston's death.

Article text: Whatever feint hopes Nottingham Forest might have held of a late charge on the play-off spots were dealt a hammer blow, as The Reds were crushed 3-1 by Norwich City, who themselves could yet secure automatic promotion. Goals from Jonny Howson, Cameron Jerome and Wes Hoolahan gave Norwich a 3-0 lead within the hour, before winger Chris Burke grabbed a consolation for Forest on 76 minutes. Meanwhile, an own goal from Blackburn Rovers' Matthew Kilgallon gifted Brighton a 1-0 win at Ewood Park, as Chris Hughton's men moved one step further away from relegation. Norwich City midfielder Wes Hoolahan (right) dribbles ahead of Nottingham Forest's Gary Gardner (left) Norwich City goalkeeper John Ruddy (left) rushes out to deny Nottingham Forest winger Michail Antonio . Elsewhere, Charlton edged Reading 3-2 in a thrilling encounter at The Valley. Pavel Pogrebnyak had opened the scoring for the visitors but saw his effort canceled out by a Yoni Buyens brace and a goal from Simon Church. Pogrebnyak then grabbed another goal for The Royals, but it proved too late to salvage even a point. It was a nightmare for Huddersfield Town at the John Smith's stadium as Nahki Wells missed two penalties for the home side against Fulham. A goal on two minutes from Alex Kacaniklic put the Cottagers ahead early on before the the three points were confirmed by a 90th minute strike from Seko Fofana. The result sees Fulham move up to 20th in the league table, eight points clear of the drop zone.

Wigan kept their hopes of survival alive with a dramatic 1-1 draw against Bolton. Substitute Martyn Waghorn grabbed the equaliser with a stunning overhead kick after teenager Tom Walker had given Wanderers the lead. Finally, Rotherham United suffered a 3-2 loss at home to Sheffield Wednesday. Goals from Ben Pringle and Jordan Bowery had canceled out Caolan Lavery's 86th minute strike for The Owls and United were 2-1 up. But a late flurry from the visitors saw them score twice in injury time through Atdhe Nuhiu and Kieran Lee.

Article text: (CNN)A.J. Pero, a longtime drummer for the metal band Twisted Sister, has died, the band posted on its Facebook page. "The members of Twisted Sister are profoundly saddened to announce the untimely passing of our brother, AJ Pero," said the post. "The band, crew and most importantly the family of AJ Pero thank you for your thoughts and prayers at this time." Pero was 55. Pero died of what appears to be a massive heart attack, his longtime agent Dan Stanton told CNN. "He had been complaining of a sore arm all week and took a few days off from his tour with the band Adrenaline Mob," says Stanton. Pero had been on a tour with the band in Poughkeepsie, New York, and was scheduled to play tonight, according to Stanton. Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French told CNN that Pero was found this morning in his tour bus. He was taken to a hospital and died there. "We are devastated. He was a great guy and one of the best drummers," French said. "To lose someone you have depended on for 33 years ... I don't know what it is going to be like to be on stage without him.  I can't even think about what it will be like." Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider tweeted about the death. "Today I lost a brother. Anthony Jude Pero passed away," Snider said in a statement. "His sledgehammer assault on the drums helped drive Twisted Sister and I to greatness and inspired me to rock every single show. My heart breaks knowing I will never feel the power of his beat behind me, or turn to see his face smiling broadly from the sheer joy he got from doing what he loved." Pero joined Twisted Sister, best known for its 1984 song "We're Not Gonna Take It" and accompanying comedic video, in 1982. Though he left for a time in 1987 to join another band, he reunited with Twisted Sister in the 1990s and was with the band for the past 12 years, according to Loudwire.com. In the "We're Not Gonna Take It" video, which also starred "Animal House's" Mark Metcalf, Pero can be seen in concert, hitting a drum that brings up a cloud of glitter. In recent years, he was also the drummer for the band Adrenaline Mob. CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this story.

Article text: Mauricio Pochettino isn’t the selfie type. So when the Tottenham manager slipped his camera phone out at Loftus Road on Saturday, you couldn’t help but notice. ‘My family was in the stands, my two sons (Maurizio, 13, and Sebastiano, 20) and my older brother (Javier). They were sitting just behind the goal in the top tier. ‘My brother is over from Argentina, he came over for the Capital One Cup final. They have the chance to go to the executive box or be in a better area but they prefer to sing the songs with the fans. So I took the photo as a souvenir. It was a fantastic moment for me and them. It was the first time I’ve done it in my career.’ Mauricio Pochettino took a photo the Spurs fans at Loftus Road as his family were among them . Harry Kane heads past Robert Green to give Tottenham the lead over QPR at Loftus Road . Spurs striker Kane celebrates as his goals keep Tottenham in the hunt for a top four finish . Javier still works on the farm where 43-year-old Pochettino grew up in Argentina’s Murphy province. Their career paths have taken different directions but that doesn’t stop Javier providing his younger, more high-profile brother with an honest assessment. ‘He is very honest — sometimes too much! He’s six years older than me. He works on the farm and watches every game live, all the games are on in Argentina.’ Whether Javier, Maurizio and Sebastiano joined in with the Harry Kane ‘He’s one of our own’ chant is not known. They certainly had the chances to do so as two more goals took Kane’s tally to 26 for the season. He is certain to be in the England squad when Roy Hodgson, who was at Loftus Road, picks his players for the clashes against Lithuania and Italy later this month. But another ‘one of their own’, Ryan Mason, would also have impressed Hodgson. ‘Is Mason close to a call-up? The question is not for me, but Roy,’ said Pochettino, whose side face Manchester United next week. Ryan Mason (left) has been linked with an England call-up after his impressive form for Tottenham . Chris Ramsey refused to get carried away with a points target after QPR lost to Tottenham . ‘This is Ryan’s first full season, even though he is 23, but he has potential to improve and, like Harry, he is progressing in a very good way.’ For QPR, however, defeat left Chris Ramsey’s side in the drop zone and preparing for a relegation battle. ‘I don’t think it’s worth setting points targets. You can only control what you can control and the points target now is three points in the next game,’ said Ramsey.

Article text: The luxurious mansion once live in by former heavyweight champions Mike Tyson in Southington, Ohio is set to be transformed into a church. Tyson was forced to sell the home for $1.3million in 1999 following his fall from grace which saw the American facing huge financial difficulties after being convicted for rape. The champion boxer lived in the Ohio residence during the late 1980s and 1990s while training for fights at Don King's facility 20 miles away in nearby Orwell. The iron gates at the entrance to the derelict mansion in Southington, Ohio, still bear the name of the former heavyweight champ . The boxer lived in the property in the late 80s and early 90s until his dramatic fall from grace when he was jailed for rape . The property features five bedrooms, several living spaces, seven and a half bathrooms, a full kitchen, a mini-kitchen/washroom, two attached garages, one external garage, full size pool and Jacuzzi, tiger cages and a basketball court . Tyson is pictured in 1988 after knocking out British champion Frank Bruno (left) and at the Mike Tyson at the iHeartRadio Music Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday . One photographer Johnny Joo, 24, was allowed inside to explore the property which featured gold-plated furnishings, a mirrored ceiling jacuzzi and a swimming pool twice the size of the average family home. It features five bedrooms, several living spaces, seven and a half bathrooms, a full kitchen, a mini-kitchen/washroom, two attached garages, one external garage, full size pool and Jacuzzi, tiger cages and a basketball court. Tyson decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers, a pool larger than most homes, tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad. But now the property lies eerily quiet with just the shell of what was once home to the youngest boxer to win the WBC, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles at age 20.

Another view of the massive entertainment room where the champion boxer entertained friends and hangers-on during his glory days . Photographer Mr Joo, from Cleveland, Ohio, said: 'My journeys have taken me to some strange places but nothing quite like the abandoned home of a former professional boxer. 'It felt cold, rather empty and eerie - not so much a creepy eerie but a more interesting one. 'I knew Mike Tyson had once just hung out here and now I stood staring down everything that had been left behind. 'I loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the Jacuzzi tub. 'But the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time. 'The room was bigger than three of my houses, it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end. Everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust. 'As I wandered the halls and rooms I imagined the wild parties which must have taken place within these walls. 'I looked across a living room once full of life but now empty of parties, tigers and celebrities.' Gold-plated fittings line the top of the landing at the vast home which is due to be renovated this year after being bought up in December . One of several grand staircases at the Ohio mansion, once home to the champion boxer once dubbed 'the baddest man on the planet' The heavy wooden front door opens up to an expanse of black marble but the once stunning home has fallen into disrepair . Tyson decked out the mansion with crystal chandeliers, a pool larger than most homes, tiger print carpet and everything else necessary to make it his private party pad . Another grand staircase leads down to the mansion's man hall with an open fire space at the bottom . The boxer was taken into custody in 1991 on allegations of rape and in 1992 a jury found him guilty with the ruling committing him to a six year prison sentence with four years of parole. In 1995 Tyson was granted parole and released from prison, returning to rural Southington in hope of escaping the media which ended up following him. Because of his increasingly desperate financial situation he put the mansion up for sale and sold it in 1999 for $1.3m (£870k). It has since had multiple owners - including one who was the subject of an FBI investigation when he tried to sell it - and is now set to be converted into a church. The current owners bought the property in December 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015, allowing Johnny to explore before the work takes place. The mansion's descent into disrepair could be said to mirror the former heavyweight champion boxer's own fall from grace . The current owners bought the property in December 2014 and will transform it throughout the rest of 2015 . He added: 'I've seen a few restorations throughout my work but nothing so contrasting as this. 'But it's definitely one of the more well-preserved structures I have been in through years of exploring and photographing abandoned places. 'It makes a perfect candidate for the church to move into and build their sanctuary. Structurally the home is wonderful and I can't wait to see the restoration completed over time. 'The group would like for Mike to attend the first gathering inside the churches sanctuary. 'I hope to help by sharing this story far and wide, maybe bringing his attention to this matter. It could be quite an experience for him walking through his former home, seeing it brought to a completely different light.'

Article text: West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has again criticised referee Mike Dean for his handling of Saturday's London derby defeat by Crystal Palace. The Hammers, currently in ninth place in the Premier League, were beaten 3-1 by the Eagles at the weekend in a contentious contest. Allardyce felt that Palace striker Glenn Murray, scorer of two goals at Upton Park, before being sent off in the 69th minute, should have been dismissed by Dean in the first half for persistent fouling. Glenn Murray was sent off for Crystal Palace during the 3-1 win against West Ham on Saturday . Sam Allardyce was frustrated that Murray was not sent off earlier in the game . Allardyce said: 'The biggest problem for me was that Glenn Murray shouldn't have been on the field, not only because of persistent fouling but the level of his fouling. 'Mike Dean, whom I have a lot of respect for, is a very good referee, but he was too lenient with Murray by telling him 'that's your last chance' after the first booking. 'In that particular instance, Palace have been let off. Mike Dean has a massive responsibility on the fact that (Murray) was one of the main reasons why Crystal Palace won. 'And for me that is something disappointing. The fact a referee warns a player for a tackle he has just made, which normally gets a yellow card, and yet he is only warned because he has just had a yellow card. And that is frustrating.' Murray climbed highest to open the scoring for the visitors in the first half with a header . Murray got his second and Palace's third when he glanced a header past Adrian . Palace captain Mile Jedinak was caught on Sky Sports TV cameras apparently elbowing Diafra Sakho as they both challenged for the ball in the closing stages. Though the incident was not seen at the time by the match officials, the Football Association have since charged the player with violent conduct – and Palace have until Tuesday evening to appeal against that decision. Allardyce has welcomed any retrospective punishment, saying that the Australian midfielder deserves a ban for acting in a dangerous manner against the Senegal striker. He added: 'Jedinak was clearly in a position where Mike Dean couldn't see it. I think about how dangerous it was. It was a very dangerous thing he did. He could have seriously injured Sakho. And he will have to take the punishment – because I think he deserves it.' Mile Jedinak has been charged by the FA with violent conduct after catching Diafra Sakho with his elbow . The incident went unpunished during the game but Jedinak was retrospectively charged . Elsewhere, in his pre-match press conference, ahead of the visit of Chelsea to East London tomorrow night, Allardyce spoke about the chats he enjoyed with Dave Mackay, the former Tottenham, Derby, Hearts and Scotland enforcer, who died aged 80. Allardyce said: 'I knew Dave. He lived in around Nottingham, when I was at Notts County for three years (1997-1999). I spent many a good night with him talking away about his time in football, about management. 'It's a sad day. He was a terrific guy not just a terrific a footballer. In life, you take a lot of things from a lot of people. 'If you want to get better, you don't just read a book or do a Masters' degree at university; you learn a lot from listening to the experiences of people who have been great in their own careers.'

Article text: Typical Paul O'Connell. Ireland are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years and, instead of the narrative being exclusively about how Joe Schmidt's side will fare in jumping hurdle number four at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, the skipper's 100th cap for his country is providing a smokescreen for teammates glad of a diversionary topic. O'Connell wouldn't be of a mind to mention his milestone within camp himself. But still, as a topic for his comrades to pass the time with during short media sessions, it falls into perfect, anything-but-Wales, territory. Take Devin Toner, the Leinster giant who has become O'Connell's regular second-row sidekick over the past few seasons. Paul O'Connell is preparing for his 100th cap for his country at the Millenium Stadium on Saturday . Joe Schmidt are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years at the Millenium Stadium . Ask about the general mechanics of the Irish lineout and the response is brief. 'I don't want to give anything away about lineout strategies,' he says. Enquire about the centurion, though, and there's, eventually, much greater pep to his patter. 'There's not much more to be said that hasn't already been said about Paulie. He's a world-class player and I don't think I'd be the player I am today without having played with him. 'I've learned so much from all the second rows I've played with, especially Leo Cullen and Paul. He's a massive leader in the squad, just a massive player on the pitch and players look up to him,' says Toner, who admits to closely watching O'Connell's ruck clear-outs as something he'd like to replicate. O'Connell gets angry during the Ireland training session at Kingspan Stadium  in Belfast, Northern Ireland . 'Just to get to 100 caps is a huge testament to how he has looked after himself and to play at the top level for that long (since his debut against Wales in 2002) is unbelievable. 'It was more intimidating playing against him for the first time because I didn't really fancy it to be honest,' continues Toner, adding that this provincial level fear has eroded now that they are Test colleagues. 'He wouldn't be in my head now… but he's kind of like Joe (Schmidt) in that you need to know your detail or he gets on top of you. That's a hugely good thing. 'More players should be doing it. He has driven standards along with Joe… the two of them just drive the squad. You don't want to disappoint either of them.' Mike Ross is another not shy about chipping in his tuppence-worth about the Ireland captain who lifted the Six Nations trophy in Paris last year. James Haskell  on the loose ball ahead of Devin Toner and Jordi Murphy  during the RBS Six Nations . O'Connell looks on after his teams victory during the RBS Six Nations match between Ireland and England . 'He has always led from the front. He might look a bit mad from the sidelines but he has always got this calm head. If things are going south, Paulie is a good man to bring everything back under check,' says the veteran tighthead about his fellow 35-year-old. 'When he was playing for Young Munster, I was over in Fermoy playing Junior Two or something like that. The first time I came into contact with him was at a Munster Under 20s training session. He has always stood out,' recalls Ross. 'I remember watching him take the park for a pre-season friendly, coming on for Mick O'Driscoll. He was an impressive physical specimen even then. 'Then he makes his debut against Wales and scores a try that he doesn't remember (due to concussion). Ireland captain O'Connell during the Ireland training session at Kingspan Stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland . 'He has always made an impression whenever he gets the chance. It's a testament to the career he has had and the esteem in which he is held that he will now get his 100th cap. 'He's always looking for more at training sessions. 'He was questioning me this week on what bind feels best in a particular scrum. Even now he's still looking for new things.' The O'Connell theme done and dusted, it's on to the more serious business at hand - successfully defending the championship. This time last year, Ireland were picking up the pieces following their lost Triple Crown match at Twickenham which left them gunning for just the Six Nations title. Italy's prop Martin Castrogiovanni  is tackled by  Toner during the Six Nations clash at the Olympic Stadium . However, while they now still have everything to play for after three championship wins stretched their overall unbeaten run to a record equalling 10 matches, Toner doesn't feel there is a different dynamic to 2015's round four preparations - even though 'Grand Slam' is the phrase on every Ireland supporter's lips. 'I don't think there is much difference. If we look at it now, it's semifinal and final time, so we are in a good place. 'It's similar to last year. If we win the two games, we win the championship and the Grand Slam,' says Toner, adding that the growing hype outside their secluded Carton House base is largely passing him by, save for last Sunday's visit to his old North Kildare stomping ground. 'I don't really read the newspaper or see much that goes on. Obviously people want to talk about it but I'm just naturally relaxed about it. It doesn't really faze me. 'I don't really get hyped up at all.'

Article text: A woman who gained 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder, started shedding the weight after running her first half marathon - and has since lost 135lbs. Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, struggled with her weight her entire life before she was diagnosed with PCOS in 2000. Six years later she managed to slim down by following a grueling diet and exercise plan - but her restricting regimen wasn't sustainable and she soon began piling the pounds back on, gaining 120lbs. In 2013 however, she underwent lap band surgery to help control her weight, and was soon inspired to start running. 'I was always drawn to that finish-line feeling, but I never thought running was possible for me,' she told Woman's Day. Shocking transformation: Michelle Stiglitz, from Staten Island, New York, lost 135lbs after having lap band surgery in 2013 . Starting out: Before she lost the weight (L), Michelle joined a running team and began training for her first half marathon. She finished her second New York City Half Marathon this month (R) 'It was difficult and painful when I was heavier,' she recalled. 'But I was so motivated by my friend's story of how exciting her race was. I knew I wanted to try it.' Michelle completed both the 2014 and 2015 New York City Half Marathons, and now she is training to run a whopping 26.2 miles during the New York City Marathon this November. Her training plan, which includes spin classes, bootcamp classes and weight lifting, as well as running, has helped her lose 135lbs. And now that she has slimmed down, Michelle is slowly but surely gaining her confidence back. New woman: Michelle put on 120lbs as a side effect of her polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder that causes weight gain (L).  After her weight loss surgery, she learned how to control her portions (R) Not easy: Even though Michelle struggled to run when she was heavier, she stuck with it . 'I used to hate dating and think I'd have to settle for just anybody, but I don't feel that way anymore,' she said. 'The most important change is I accept myself.' Michelle noted that although she still has excess skin on her arms and legs, she is finally happy with herself. But getting to this point was far from easy for Michelle, who had tried almost everything to control her weight. Before she was diagnosed with PCOS in her senior year of high school, Michelle had rapidly put on pounds and was starting to lose her hair. Big smile: Michelle can be seen snapping an action selfie during her most recent race . More confident: Michelle said she has gained her confidence back after her weightloss transformation . PCOS made her insulin-resistant, so it was nearly impossible for her to lose weight. She was given various medications and shots - including prescription diet pills - but nothing worked. Michelle eventually hired a personal trainer and followed a strict diet plan that was created for her by a nutritionist. She managed to lose 120lbs over the course of a year, but working out two hours per day and living on a diet of only vegetables and protein left her with little to no social life. When the weight slowly crept back onto her frame, she finally considered lap band surgery, which is intended to reduce the quantity of food consumed. The procedure involves an inflatable device being placed around the top portion of the stomach to create a smaller stomach pouch, essentially shrinking stomach capacity. Amazing fete: Michelle posed in a black dress (L) before she lost 115lbs and 42.5 inches off her frame (R) Personal win: Michelle can be seen holding the medal she received after she completed the New York City Half Marathon . Michelle noted that she didn't want people to think she had 'taken the easy way out', but she quickly learned it was a 'tool, not a miracle'. She still had to learn how to control her portions and make healthy choices, while maintaining a regular workout schedule. Michelle proudly showed her fifth grade students her completion medal after she completed her first half marathon. And when one of her students congratulated her for winning the race, Michelle didn't correct her, explaining that, in a way, she felt like she had won after overcoming such adversity in order to achieve her goals.

Article text: The famous weathervane at the Home of Cricket has been damaged during high winds over the weekend. Father Time, who sits above the Mound Stand at Lord's, has been bent almost 90 degrees by strong wind in London. Weekend gales in St John's Wood have knocked the deathly steel figure parallel to the ground, but mercifully still in his elevated roof-top position with scythe and bail on stumps intact. The Father Time weathervane at Lord's has been bent almost 90 degrees by high winds . The famous weathervane has been at Lord's since 1926 after it was presented to the MCC . Father Time is one of the famous features at Lord's and staff are working to get it back to normal . Staff from Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord's, are working with specialists to restore it to its original position as soon as possible. Lord's is due to host its first game of the season on Sunday, April 12 when Middlesex entertain Nottinghamshire in the LV= County Championship. This is not the first time the weathervane has fallen foul of the elements, back in 1992 it was struck by lightning and the subsequent repairs were featured on children's TV show Blue Peter. Father Time was given to MCC in 1926 by the architect of the Lord's Grand Stand, Sir Herbert Baker. During World War II, it was wrenched from its original perch when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon. Staff set about trying to repair and restore Father Time to it's original glory . Father Time tweeted to say he had been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment . It was reattached to the top of the Grand Stand where it sat until 1996 when it was relocated to the Mound Stand. The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 16(3) of the Laws of Cricket: 'After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets.' But he has, as his name indicates, moved with the times - and tweets these days on behalf of Lord's Cricket Ground, including an update on his latest mishap. The two posts read: 'NEWS: I've was felled by high winds last night! Ouch! 'Apologies for my poor grammar in the previous tweet - but I'm not feeling my best after being damaged last night!' Father Time later tweeted: 'I've been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment ASAP.'

Article text: Frat boy: Jeffrey Yam, 21, is one of two Syracuse University students charged with first-degree hazing for allegedly making three fraternity pledges to crawl in the snow . A Syracuse University pledge may lose four fingers after being forced to crawl in the snow and perform late-night push-ups, and two fraternity members now face charges for the hazing stunt. Three young men pledging the Nu Alpha Phi fraternity were taken to Lower Hookway Park around midnight Saturday and made to do exercises wearing hooded sweatshirts, pants, boots but no gloves for 'failing to perform their daily duties,' according to Syracuse police. Pledges usually perform physical exercise in the attic of the fraternity house at 739 Ackerman Avenue, according to police. After about 30 minutes of crawling and rolling around in the snow, the pledges were given hand warmers and told to walk back to the frat house, according to police. One of the pledges, an unidentified 20-year-old man, experienced extreme pain in his hands and sought treatment Sunday at a hospital. 'He ran his hands under warm water, but his hands were still extremely painful,' police said in a release. Doctors told him he may lose his ring and pinkie fingers on both hands because of severe frostbite. Syracuse police Lt. Eric Carr said the unidentified victim will have an appointment Thursday or Friday to check the condition of his fingers. 'Obviously he's concerned because this could be a life-altering injury,' Carr said. Police on Wednesday arrested frat members Tae Kim, 19 and Jeffrey Yam, 21 and charged them with first-degree hazing, a misdemeanor. They were released and will appear in court March 18. It could not immediately be determined if the two men had lawyers. Syracuse University has suspended Nu Alpha Phi, which is described on its website as an Asian-interest fraternity with seven chapters at New York colleges and one in New Jersey. Harsh measures: A trio of Syracuse students were pledging to Nu Alpha Phi fraternity Saturday night when they were herded to a nearby park and forced to do push-ups without gloves. A 20-year-old suffered severe frostbite as a result,  which may cost him four fingers . Response: Syracuse officials said the college has zero tolerance for any form of hazing . 'The university has zero tolerance for any form of hazing and takes this matter extremely seriously,' the school said in a statement. Yam and Kim will be subjected to a code of conduct hearing to determine their future at the university. Police said the two other pledges refused to participate with the investigation. One of the other pledges had swollen hands and blistering, Carr said.

Article text: (CNN)Israel's ruling Likud Party pulled off a victory in Tuesday's election -- and it was a stunning one. During the campaign, incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum, for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the White House, to his fixation on the Iran nuclear issue, to allegations over Netanyahu's household expenses. Yet despite this unpromising backdrop, Likud is on course to win 30 seats in the Knesset, six seats more than the main opposition Zionist Union -- headed by Isaac Herzog and Tsipi Livni, and an obvious favorite of the Israeli media establishment and Europe, Washington, and the West Bank. The blow to the Zionist Union is particularly painful because some opinion polls had actually had the party leading Likud as the campaign drew to a close. (Likud wasn't the only winner of the night --the new center-right party Kulanu (All of Us), which focuses on the economy, also had a good showing, securing 10 seats). Still, Likud's resounding hasn't settled the eventual makeup of the government -- in the coming weeks, the work of negotiating a coalition will begin. With this in mind, there is a good chance that President Reuven Rivlin will ask Netanyahu to form a national unity government, either with the Zionist Union, or as the head of a right-wing coalition (although the bitter rivalry between Herzog/Livni and Netanyahu during the campaign makes the latter more likely). Overall, the election results seemed to reflect the rightward shift of the electorate, with even voters who self-identify as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the Palestinian issue and broader questions of national security. Meanwhile, the numbers for the left in Tuesday's election -- a four seats for Meretz, 24 for the Zionist Union and 14 for the Arab List suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition. As a result, the international community and the Palestinian leadership will have to face the reality that negotiations over the Palestinian state will be conducted with the center-right. So, what can we expect from the new Netanyahu government? Issues that dominated the campaign, namely security and the economy, will likely dominate. For a start, Netanyahu will try to improve his record on domestic and social issues by introducing more proactive policies tied to housing and land reform.  The issue of housing  requires especially painful economic and bureaucratic changes over the Israel Land Authority and planning and zoning processes. But to address these Issues properly, Netanyahu will have to confront land owners and the housing constructors, meaning key structural reforms are unlikely in the short term. In addition, Netanyahu will also have to repair the fractured relationship with Washington, something that may not be easy given that ties with the Obama administration will largely depends on whether a nuclear deal over Iran is reached, and what shape such a deal takes. That raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security, and on this, the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo. This is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of non-state hostile actors suggests that Israel should instead move beyond a short-term approach and toward building a long-term, comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power. Making such a change would require a political process capable of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rather than merely kicking the can down the road. Restarting communication with the West Bank leadership and properly engaging with the Arab Peace Initiative would be steps in the right direction. All that said, this will be Netanyahu's fourth term in office, and so there is plenty of evidence with which to judge his likely trajectory. And that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive long-tern national security strategy. Those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again.

Article text: (CNN)Retired NFL star Darren Sharper changed course and pleaded guilty Monday to one count of sexual assault and one count of attempted sexual assault. Sharper has been in jail in Los Angeles since last year, but this case was in Arizona. Sharper and his attorney had a telephone meeting with Judge Warren Granville, where the former player and television analyst changed his plea. The judge sentenced Sharper to nine years in prison with no eligibility for early release, Maricopa County Attorney's Office spokesman Jerry Cobb said. Sharper will also be placed on lifetime probation afterward. Sharper, a five-time Pro Bowl player, originally faced five counts of drugging and raping three women in Scottsdale, Arizona, in November 2013. Before being indicted in Arizona, Sharper was arrested in California on charges of drugging and raping two women in that state. He was also under investigation in other states. Florida prosecutors announced last year they would not prosecute Sharper on similar allegations, but he faces federal charges in Louisiana. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. The five-time Pro Bowl player intercepted 63 passes in his career, tying for seventh all-time. He is tied for second all-time in interceptions returned for touchdowns with 11, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He later worked as an analyst for NFL Network. Sharper will get about 300 days credit for time already served in California, Cobb said. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

Article text: Australia captain Michael Clarke will retire from one-day internationals following Sunday's World Cup final against New Zealand. The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference in Melbourne ahead of the match against the Black Caps. 'I think it's the right time for me and the Australian cricket team,' read a report on www.cricket.com.au, Cricket Australia's official news outlet. Michael Clarke shakes hands with New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum ahead of Sunday's final . The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference on Saturday morning . 'I don't think it's reasonable to expect I'll be fit and healthy and available for the next World Cup, so I think it's the right time.' Clarke has played 244 ODIs for his country since making his debut in 2003, scoring 7907 runs at an average of 44.42, and was made captain when Ricky Ponting stood down following the 2011 World Cup. 'I know I've made the right decision,' he said. 'I told my team-mates 10 minutes ago. I told the selectors and (Cricket Australia boss) James Sutherland about an hour ago.' Shortly after Clarke made his announcement, Cricket Australia chief executive Sutherland released a statement thanking the batsman for his service. Clarke, who will continue to play at Test level, is pictured playing a shit in the nets ahead of Sunday's match . Clarke, pictured with team-mate Shane Watson, will lead Australia against England in the Ashes later this year . 'Michael informed me and his team-mates of his decision earlier today,' it read. 'We congratulate him on a wonderful career in one-day international cricket. 'From the time that he burst onto the scene as an exciting 21-year old way back in January 2003, he was always destined for great things. 'While his decision comes as something of a surprise, Michael leaves one-day cricket on his own terms, aiming to finish on an absolute high, in front of a packed MCG as a possible World Cup-winning captain. That's very special. 'Regardless of the result, he will leave the one-day international game as one our greats. We thank him for his wonderful contribution to one-day cricket and look forward to his continued leadership at Test level.' Clarke appeared in good spirits as he prepared for his final one-day international match on Sunday . Clarke will lead Australia in England this summer as they look to defend the Ashes they won with a whitewash in 2014 and he admitted that a desire to prolong his Test career was behind his decision. 'That's obviously a priority for me to continue to be successful in the Test format,' he said. 'By walking away from one-day cricket it probably gives me my best opportunity. 'I don't feel bad about saying I feel that Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. 'I love that challenge. I see it as the pinnacle. I feel like I've still got a lot to offer the Australian Test team as captain.' Clarke made his ODI debut 12 years ago and has scored almost 8,000 runs for his country . Speculation will now mount over who will replace Clarke at the helm with George Bailey and Steve Smith the two most likely candidates. Bailey has led the 50-over team in Clarke's absence due to back and hamstring injuries recently but Steve Smith was handed the Test reins during the recent series win over India. And while Clarke admitted that Smith had impressed over the winter, he refused to get drawn into the debate over his replacement. 'Smithy has certainly matured as a player and a person,' he said. 'I don't think it would be fair for me to go into who is going to be the next captain, it's not my place. It's up to the selectors.' Clarke has led Australia in 73 one-day matches and victory on Sunday would be a 50th win at the helm.

Article text: When Moonlight the cat went missing almost nine years ago, his distraught owners tried everything to find him, before giving him up for dead six months later. But now the beloved pet has been reunited with owner Rosie Collier, 52,  after turning up at a vet's surgery two miles away from her house in Chediston, Suffolk, earlier this week. Mrs Collier, who lives with husband John, and 17-year-old daughter Melba, says the beloved animal is now back living with them and their other pets. Moonlight initially disappeared while staying with Mrs Collier's parents, Denise and Chris, in Wenhaston, while Mrs Collier was on holiday. Rosie Collier, 52 (centre), and daughter Melba (centre left) were reunited with pet Moonlight after nine years when a member of the public brought him to vet Jenny Reason (far right) who found he was microchipped . Mrs Collier said Moonlight went missing nine years ago while she was on holiday, and the family gave him up for dead after a cat matching his description was found in the road, but he miraculously survived . When she returned the family spent months looking for Moonlight, before a cat matching his description was found dead in the road. Mrs Collier said the family were 'devastated' at the loss, and even planted a special memorial tree for Moonlight in their back garden. However, unbeknownst to them, the pet was actually alive, and is believed to have survived wild on a nearby heath, hunting and killing his own food. Believing he was a neighbour's cat, a female animal-lover in the village occasionally fed Moonlight whenever he stopped by, but took him to the vet after noticing he had lost some fur. When the cat got there, medics discovered he had been microchipped, and were able to track down his owners. Mrs Collier said: 'I simply couldn’t believe it - it’s just miraculous! I was just so surprised, I really did not expect to ever get good old Moonlight back. 'I was in shock at first but then I had a huge grin from ear to ear for the rest of the day.' The news was particularly exciting for Melba, who was just eight at the time the cat went missing, and was distraught over losing him. Mrs Collier explained: 'There were buckets of tears. Melba was very distressed, even her dance teacher can still remember how upset she was - it was that traumatic.' But rather than inform her daughter straight away, Mrs Collier waited until Melba, who celebrated her 17th birthday yesterday, returned from Bungay college that evening to break the news. Mrs Collier believes Moonlight was living wild on a nearby heath, eating whatever he could catch. A female animal-lover also fed him scraps, and then took him to the vet when she noticed he had fur missing . Melba said: 'I was just really shocked. Eight years is a really long time and so I was not expecting it at all - it’s just so good to have our Moonlight back after all this time.' After a cautious reintroduction to Echo, the family’s golden retriever, and two new pets, Tilly the black labrador and Dusty the cat, Moonlight is happier than ever. Mrs Collier said: 'I was not sure he would remember us after so many years but he came straight home and he has been purring and rubbing himself up against us. 'He obviously still knows and remembers who we are - even the dog.' 'We always knew he was a good hunter, so if he was alive he would probably be OK looking after himself. 'We think he must have been living wild on the heath near here, killing rabbits and mice, but also taking advantage of people who would feed him. 'We are just so happy to have Moonlight back - it’s a genuine miracle.' Vet Jenny Reason, who discovered Moonlight was microchipped, added: 'When a missing pet turns up, it’s usually a matter of days, sometimes a little longer, but I’ve never known a pet to return after over eight and a half years. 'It’s a fantastic story - and just goes to show why it’s so absolutely vital to chip your pet.'

Article text: Seyne-les-Alpes, France (CNN)It's a dangerous task as well as a grim one. The rescue workers battling to gather the pulverized pieces of Germanwings Flight 9525 and the remains of the 150 people on board must contend with high winds as well as treacherous terrain. They climb up a rugged mountain, appearing to cling to its side by their fingernails. Bit by bit, bag by bag, high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters, trying to remain stable in the high winds.  Rescuers pin red flags on the earth when they discover new fragments. Winched down from helicopters on to the steep, icy slopes, where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters, workers have had to be tied together in two-person teams. One is there to carry out the investigation and recovery. The second is charged with ensuring their safety as they're buffeted by the weather. Complicating matters, very few of the bodies have been found whole, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations, told CNN on Friday. And winds have picked up, making it difficult for helicopters to ferry the workers to the site in the French Alps in the first place, he said. Authorities have deployed 45 Alpine police officers to help forensics teams -- not accustomed to working in mountain ravines -- recover the bodies safely, Naffrechoux said. His team is based out of Seyne-les-Alpes, a normally sleepy Alpine village that since Tuesday's crash has been transformed into a hub for the recovery operation. The leaders of Germany, France and Spain have visited. The families of the victims have laid flowers and prayed at a nearby memorial. Journalists have flocked to the spot as they report the latest developments. Meanwhile, the rescue workers have continued their hazardous mission. Before anything could be recovered, the position of the bodies and debris had to be mapped. Human remains must be treated with due respect despite the tricky conditions. The workers are now removing more bodies from the site, Naffrechoux said. The priority remains to find all the bodies and the elusive second "black box," the plane's flight data recorder, he said. Investigators hope, once found, it could yield more clues into what happened on the flight deck of the Germanwings plane before it slammed into the mountainside at about 430 miles per hour. Already, the Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, has revealed that cockpit audio indicated that German co-pilot Andreas Lubitz "wanted to destroy the aircraft." The recovery teams are trying to construct a road to access the site more quickly and aid the transportation of bodies to a DNA testing center where they are kept in refrigerated units, said Naffrechoux. It's hoped the process will take 10 to 15 days, depending on weather, he said. Testimonials posted by France's Interior Ministry from rescue and recovery workers at the scene also give an insight into the tough conditions at the remote crash site. Cmdr. Emmanuel G., of the Criminal Research Institute from the National Gendarmerie, said it was a "really complicated" process. "We are working in two-person teams, whether it's alongside (police) mountain guides, the local gendarmes or the alpine firemen and emergency teams," he said. "We do not know how to continue in this situation otherwise, we really need them to ensure our security at all times." "It's the first time police technicians and gendarmes are working together," an unnamed technician in one of those two-person teams is quoted as saying. "We have total trust in each other. He's holding my life in his hands." CNN's Antonia Mortensen and Nic Robertson reported from Seyne-les-Alpes and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Karl Penhaul,  Ariana Williams and Dheeptika Laurent contributed to this report.

Article text: For three long years Claire O’Meara put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing. Long hours spent at her computer, plus business trips abroad were surely responsible for triggering the searing headaches that made it feel as though her head was being gripped in a vice. ‘I was 30 when the migraines began, randomly at first, but then they came every month,’ says Claire, 35, who lives in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, with her husband Brendan, 42, a fitness centre owner. ‘I blamed my career and lifestyle. At work, I’d have to sit in a dark room and shut my eyes as the pain was all-consuming. Sometimes, the migraines would wipe me out for a week. Claire O’Meara (pictured) used to put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing . ‘Despite being a virtual workaholic, there were times I was unable to function and would have to phone in sick, which left me feeling terribly guilty.’ Things got so bad that last year Claire gave up her job to work part-time for her husband, helping to market his firm. But then Claire had an epiphany when she began keeping a diary of her headaches — her migraines were linked to her menstrual cycle. ‘I noticed they always came the day before my period, and it was a relief to finally realise what the trigger was. ‘It altered the way I tried to deal with them. I took advice, mapped out my cycles, and upped my dosage of magnesium (said to regulate hormones) and took over-the-counter drug Migraleve to try to prevent a migraine coming on 24 hours before I knew my period was due. This has staved off a full-blown migraine for the last few months.’ Claire is not the only woman suffering from this commonly misdiagnosed side-effect of the menstrual cycle. Claire (pictured after a migraine) gave up her job to work part-time for her husband last year when the migraines got really bad . According to charity the National Migraine Centre, a staggering 50 per cent of women suffer menstrual migraines immediately before, during or just after their period. But, like Claire, very many don’t make the connection between the two for years — and neither do their GPs. Online forums are awash with women discussing the ‘lightbulb moment’ they finally realised their cycle was to blame. Although migraines are an age-old problem, the diagnosis of specific menstrual migraines is a modern phenomenon, following extensive research over the past 25 years. Professor Anne MacGregor, a leading specialist in headaches and women’s health, says: ‘The most common cause is a drop in oestrogen towards the end of the cycle. This hormone is released at the start of it, and levels rise, eventually triggering ovulation and an egg’s release. Claire (pictured) has seen various GPs and doctors about her severe migraines but none have been able to come up with a treatment that has worked completely . ‘Progesterone is released and prepares the womb lining for a fertilised egg. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, both levels drop and cause a period. ‘It’s this sudden drop that triggers a migraine as the body deals with the hormone withdrawal.’ She says hormones used in contraceptives, such as the Pill, coil and patch put all women of menstruating age at risk — but those in their 30s and 40s more so. ‘This is because hormone levels fluctuate more in the years building up to the menopause, mean ing the drop in oestrogen and therefore withdrawal symptoms are greater,’ she reveals. ‘Traditional headache remedies don’t work. This is why we’d like to see greater diagnosis, so women can get the right treatment.’ Claire’s work was not the only thing that suffered. She often found herself saying to Brendan: ‘Not tonight, darling, I’ve a headache’ — and meaning it. ‘Thank goodness he’s very understanding,’ she says. Her social life was often wrecked, too: ‘I’ve had to regularly cancel social engagements, including a close friend’s baby shower.’ Claire saw various doctors: her GP, another for a second opinion, plus a consultant — but none came up with a treatment that worked completely. ‘All they suggested was that I take Migraleve, but until I started taking it as a preventative measure it did nothing to help me.’ Dr Jud Pearson, at the National Migraine Centre, advises patients who suspect their headaches may be menstruation-related to start keeping a diary like Claire. ‘I think women have always suspected they have menstrual migraines but doctors have not always believed them until now. ‘Now, however, there is a growing awareness of the condition, which means more women are finally being diagnosed.’ Marie Brown 47, a dental company sales consultant living in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has had migraines for more than a decade, but only found out two years ago they were linked to her menstrual cycle, thanks to the migraine diary she was keeping. Marie Brown, 47, (pictured) has also suffered from severe migraines for more than ten years but only discovered two years ago that they are related to her periods . She reveals: ‘The first migraine I suffered was in my late 30s, and even going from bed to bathroom caused agonising pain in my head. There were times I wondered whether the headaches were a symptom of something horribly sinister, such as a brain tumour.’ Only when the migraines became a monthly occurrence, at age 44, did Marie made the connection. She now has a supply of the migraine drug Sumatriptan on hand to take on her ‘danger’ days to prevent attacks. ‘It was such a relief to finally find something that worked for me. But if I don’t take a tablet in time, the ensuing migraine is hell.’ Even with the medication, she still plans her social life and work meetings around her periods. ‘I deliberately don’t book anything for the week of my period, as on so many occasions I’ve had to bolt when a migraine has started. Marie (seen here age 27) uses medication to combat the headaches but still has to plan her social life and meetings around her periods . ‘Last New Year’s Eve I had to abandon dinner with my partner and go to bed at 10pm, when one came on. ‘Unlike most women, I’m actually longing for the menopause in the hope that once my periods stop, so too will the migraines.’ For Sarah Rose, 31, a special educational needs support assistant who lives in Croydon, Surrey, with partner Paul, 33, a sales manager, and their son Jack, two, the severity of monthly menstrual migraines was so great last Easter that her GP sent her to A&E fearing she had a bleed on the brain. ‘I spent five days in hospital on morphine. A CT scan ruled out anything sinister, but I had felt as though my head would literally explode. It was so frightening, all I could think was my lovely little boy needs his mummy and what if something serious was happening to me?’ Marie (pictured) suffered her first migraine in her late 30s, but they became a monthly occurrence when she reached 44, at which point Marie connected the pain to her menstrual cycle . However, unlike many other women, Sarah has suffered from menstrual migraines for all of the years of her adult life. ‘I first had the headaches at school but blamed exam stress for them. They worsened at university and my GP sent me to a neurologist. ‘He diagnosed migraines, but didn’t link them to my cycle. ‘It wasn’t until I was talking to my great aunt, now in her 80s five years ago, that I realised the cause. She said she used to suffer terrible migraines during her period and suspected this was my problem, too. ‘After that, I used the Period Tracker Deluxe mobile phone app to record my symptoms and periods and, sure enough, a pattern soon emerged. ‘Subsequently I also tried homeopathy, specifically a herbal remedy called sepia, which is supposed to help problems associated with your period problems.’ Sarah is an extreme case. But, for many women, the stark facts are that a migraine is another monthly misery they have to endure.

Ground truth Summary: Claire O’Meara, 35, put her headaches down to the stress of her career .
Things got so bad that last year Claire gave up her job to work part-time .
Marie Brown, 47, has suffered from migraines for over a decade .
She kept a diary and realised they were linked to her menstrual cycle .
----------------------------------------
Generated Summary: Claire O'Meara used to put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing. Long hours spent at her computer, plus business trips abroad were surely responsible for triggering the searing headaches that made it feel as though her head was being gripped in a vice.

Article text: (CNN)Empathy. Confidence. Passion. These are the traits the next police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police. So says Cecil Smith. And maybe he should know. Smith is the police chief in Sanford, Florida, another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police-community relations after the high-profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. And if Smith's experience is any guide, it will take "a lot of prayer and a little goading" to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by Chief Thomas Jackson. "That community, as we see, has been hurting and struggling for some time now," he says. And how: . -- The community remains deeply scarred by the events last year, after the August shooting death of unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, and the November decision by the St. Louis County Grand Jury not to charge Wilson, who later resigned. Occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy-handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust. -- The police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week's release of a damning Department of Justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of Ferguson officials. -- Add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early Thursday of two police officers only hours after Jackson resigned. The decision for Jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city, Mayor James Knowles told reporters. He'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to Ferguson police Lt. Col Al Eickhoff next week. The city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement, Knowles said. "The City of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity.  We are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness," said Knowles -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign. To get there, it might look to Sanford for guidance. There, trust in the police department bottomed out in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin shooting. While no police officers were involved in the shooting, anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager's killer, George Zimmerman, pushed relations in the community to a boiling point, eventually resulting in the firing of Chief Bill Lee. Zimmerman eventually was arrested, and a jury acquitted him. Smith watched the chaos play out from Elgin, Illinois, where he was deputy police chief. A former boss in Illinois suggested he look at the job, so he traveled to Florida on his own time, getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police. He still isn't sure how to explain why he took the job. "The first year, I was still wondering, was it a smart move?" Smith joked. But things are better now, he says. After taking the job, Smith made it a point of spending time "walking and talking" in Sanford, building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents. Inside the department, stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing. He also stepped up recruitment of African-American officers. "One of the things that's going on is we don't have people who look like us in the community," said Smith, himself an African-American. He handed out long-delayed promotions. And he even presided over a makeover, enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms. The new chief in Ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things, Smith says. Community leaders and other officials agree. "We need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind Chief Jackson is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues," Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson Township," told CNN Wednesday. "We need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run." New York police Commissioner William Bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces. There is the lack of trust on the community's part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership. On the first issue, he said: "You need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change." To police leadership consultant John Vanek, whoever takes over the Ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines, to think differently, to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight. But that's easier said than done. "There's going to be a lot of hostility in Ferguson for a long time," he said. So will the new chief need to be African-American to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city? Here's the politic answer: Find the right candidate, regardless of race. "You want to find the best candidate to be police chief," said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.  "But diversity is very important. It's very important that the police officers understand the communities, at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving." "There's an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed," Crump said. "We don't want to be policed. We want to be protected and served as any American citizen." CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.

Article text: An aristocratic actress turned environmentalist has halted plans for one of Britain’s first factory pig farms after teaming up with TV star Dominic West. Marchioness of Worcester Tracy Somerset and her campaign group, which included Eton-educated West, star of The Wire, fought for four years against the proposal for an indoor farm to house 25,000 pigs. The Marchioness, 56, whose best-known role was as Tessa Robinson in the 1980s TV detective series C.A.T.S. Eyes, argued that the farming practice is cruel and leaves the animals unwell and stressed. Victory: Tracy, Marchioness of Worcester has won a battle against a factory pig farm in Derbyshire . Enthusiast: The actress turned aristocrat is an outspoken campaigner for animal rights . Midland Pig Producers has now withdrawn its application, saying it did so because the Environment Agency objected to smells that would affect residents near the planned pig farm at Foston, Derbyshire. The Marchioness, whose husband Henry is heir to the Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, said the decision was a ‘victory for all who care about animals’. The peeress, an outspoken campaigner for sustainable farming, said: 'Intensive, indoor animal factories belong to the past. 'We hope this means people are waking up to the importance of knowing where their food comes from as well as the hidden costs of intensive farming. 'There is mounting evidence that industrial, intensive pig-rearing systems not only cause stress and illness in animals but also threaten human health.' The former actress married Henry Somerset, heir to the Duke of Beaufort and the Badminton Estate, in 1987, although the couple separated last year. Star: The former actress is pictured left with  Leslie Ash in C.A.T.S. Eyes, and right as Miss Scarlet in Cluedo . Aristocrat: Lady Worcester married Henry, Marquess of Worcester, in 1987 and recently separated from him . Activist: The campaigner led a protest against a proposed farm which she claimed would be cruel . After retiring from acting following a career which included playing Miss Scarlet in TV game show Cluedo, she became an animal welfare activist. She has previously broken into factory farms in Poland and South America in order to stage protests there, and lobbied spectators at the Badminton Horse Trials held on her own family's estate. Lady Worcester said today: 'Industrial-scale farming threatens the livelihood of high welfare farmers in rural communities. 'The regular over-use of antibiotics in factory farm systems has produced antibiotic-resistant superbugs. 'In addition, they pollute water and air as well as damaging local businesses.' As well as her animal rights advocacy, Lady Worcester has campaigned against Britain's membership of the EU and in support of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Celebrity: TV star Dominic West also joined the campaign against the gigantic farm in Derbyshire . Home: Lady Worcester has previously lobbied spectators at the Badminton Horse Trials, held at her family's ancestral home of Badminton House, pictured . Mr West, the star of acclaimed HBO drama The Wire, was a high-profile supporter of her campaign against the pig farm. 'The proposed factory farming of 25,000 pigs is an abomination,' he said. 'I hope MPP will not just set up somewhere else, so when we buy British we know we are not supporting this type of cruel and dangerous farming. 'The costs are much too high, from the superficial horrors of stench and stressed, unhealthy animals to antibiotic resistance that brings us closer to the end of antibiotics as a cure for human diseases. 'The world must move on, and we can all help by only buying pork from high welfare UK farms.' A spokesman for MPP said: 'The time taken by the Environment Agency to reach its conclusions has drawn out the entire process way beyond our initial estimates, something totally beyond our control. 'But we appreciate the pressure this has placed on the planning authorities and the lengthy period of uncertainty for local residents, both of which we feel could have been avoided. 'We believe that there should be a fundamental overhaul of the planning and permit application process to prevent such a long-winded situation from occurring again.'

Article text: Chelsea Handler had an in-person meeting with Bill Cosby where she believed she narrowly avoided being victimized. Speaking with Esquire magazine alongside Nick Offerman, the comedian and author described being freaked out by an invitation to Cosby's hotel suite and bringing three male friends for support. 'I was in Atlantic City playing, doing stand-up,' Handler said. 'And he was doing stand-up in Atlantic City in the same hotel.' A near Cosby: Speaking with Esquire magazine, Chelsea Handler described being invited to Cosby's hotel suite and bringing three male friends . 'At like three o’clock in the afternoon, someone from the hotel came down and said, "Oh, you know, Mr. Cosby would really like to meet you up in his hotel suite."' 'I thought, "That’s really weird,"' she continued. 'I don't want to go alone.' Handler says that three guys who were with her on the trip filming accompanied her up to Cosby's suite and the meeting passed without incident. The story followed a comment by writer Scott Raab expressing sympathy for the comedian who has faced a long line of women alleging he drugged and sexually assaulted them. 'Not poor guy—he tried to Cosby me,' Handler exclaimed. She claimed even after stories of decades of assault came to light, she didn't put her own experience in that context until a friend reminded her. Accusations: Dozens of women have come forward with allegations, some old, some never uncovered, about being drugged and sexually assaulted by the famous comedian . Backup: Handler said she brought three friends because she felt uncomfortable, one of whom reminded her of the incident years later as accusations began pouring in . 'I forgot about it when all the stories about Bill Cosby came out,' Handler said. 'I didn’t even think of it.' 'Then my friend texted me the other day saying, “Do you remember that night we went up to, or that afternoon we went up to Bill Cosby’s and you were so freaked out you made us come with you?”' 'He said, "Hello! You could’ve been one of his victims if we weren’t there."' 'He’s guilty,' Handler concluded. 'I think it’s pretty obvious now.'

Article text: A video showing former NFL star Aaron Hernandez allegedly holding a gun and leaving his home with his two co-defendants just hours before the shooting death of Odin Lloyd has been played in court. The footage, taken by the extensive surveillance system in and around Hernandez's Massachusetts house, was captured on June 17, 2013, the day Lloyd was gunned down in a nearby industrial park. It shows the ex-New England Patriots tight end returning to his $1.3million property, where his infant daughter was being babysat, after celebrating Father's Day with his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. After arriving back home at around 12.45am, he is filmed walking through the living room carrying a large black object, before putting it in his pocket. Prosecutors have claimed the item was a gun. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: This video footage, which was played in Bristol County Superior Court on Monday, shows ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez (right) walking through his home carrying a large black object on June 17, 2013 . Evidence: Prosecutors have claimed the object Hernandez was holding (right) at around 12.45am that day - just hours before Odin Lloyd was shot dead at an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts - was a gun . On trial: The video also shows the ex-New England Patriots tight end (pictured in court on Monday) returning to his $1.3million property with his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Their infant daughter was being babysat inside . However, when the video was played for jurors on Monday, the object was indiscernible. Hernandez and Jenkins's babysitter Jennifer Fortier, 28, then testified she had not seen the item in the room. The footage also shows Hernandez and Jenkins being greeted the suspect's two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, who are also accused of killing Lloyd, who was dating Jenkins's sister. And it depicts Hernandez climbing into the front passenger seat of a Nissan Altima rental car and leaving his home at 1:09 am, with Wallace driving and Ortiz sitting in the rear driver's-side seat. The latter two men have pleaded not guilty to murder. They will be tried separately from Hernandez. At an earlier hearing, surveillance video - captured at a gas station south of Boston  an hour after the trio had left Hernandez's North Attleboro home - was played to Bristol County Superior Court. It showed the former NFL player driving the Nissan. Prosecutors have previously said the suspects went to pick up Lloyd, then took him to the industrial park, where he was shot just before 3:30am. Departure: Footage played in court on Monday depicts Hernandez climbing into the front passenger seat of a Nissan Altima rental car and leaving his home at 1:09 am, with Wallace driving and Ortiz sitting in the back . The trio then drive off (pictured). Wallace and Ortiz are also accused of murder and are being tried separately . Babysitter: As the video footage was played for jurors, the object Hernandez was carrying on the night was indiscernible. His and Jenkins's babysitter Jennifer Fortier (pictured), 28, said she had not seen the item at all . The Nissan was returned to the rental car agency by Hernandez later that day. It had scrapes along the driver's side, while the driver's-side mirror was missing, according to previous testimony. Another surveillance video previously played shows Hernandez holding what is alleged to be a gun inside his living room just minutes after Lloyd, a semi-professional football player, was shot dead. Earlier on Monday, Judge Susan Garsh told the Fall River-based court that she had received a note from a juror. He was questioned privately at the bench. Trial then resumed. Court: At an earlier hearing, surveillance video - captured at a gas station south of Boston an hour after the trio had left Hernandez's North Attleboro home - was played to Bristol County Superior Court. It showed the former NFL player (pictured speaking with his attorney, Charles Rankin, during Monday's trial) driving the Nissan . Teary-eyed: Ursula Ward, the mother of victim  Lloyd, listens to testimony during Hernandez's murder trial . On Friday, Diane Fife Biagiotti, a Massachusetts State Police crime lab DNA analyst, testified had she found the DNA of Hernandez and Lloyd on a marijuana cigarette recovered near Lloyd's body. She also said she found Hernandez's DNA on an empty shell casing that had been stuck to a piece of blue chewing gum and removed from the Nissan the suspect had returned to the rental agency. Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to murder, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted. He was released from the Patriots hours after his arrest in June 2013.

Article text: With her puppy dog eyes, Millie the cocker spaniel knows exactly how to persuade her owner to feed her a treat. She stares up, pleading for a morsel of food, and when her owner Jacqueline Maguire gives in, the dog waddles around wagging her tail in delight. But all those extra nibbles have added up - and now Millie is morbidly obese. Scroll down for video . Chubby: Millie the cocker spaniel weighs 74lbs - which is twice the average a dog of her breed should do . Heavy: At that weight, it is little surprise the prized pet is looking a little slow on her feet . Weighing in at nearly 74lb, she is twice the size of a healthy cocker spaniel. Vets say that Millie, who has now been put on a strict diet, is symptomatic of the ballooning British population of obese pets. According to a report published today by the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), there will be more overweight pets than healthy pets within five years. Some 80 per cent of vets surveyed by the charity reported an increase in obesity cases they had seen in the last two years. Mrs Maguire, 75, from Romford, admitted that Millie put on weight because she is fed too much. She said her dog has perfected the begging routine - even doing a ‘happy dance’ when fed an extra treat. Fat: Bulldog Daisy, from Middlesbrough, is another of Britain's heavy hounds . Portly: But it is not just a problem with dogs - Grace the giant rabbit also weighs far too much . All creatures great and small: As does Spider, the rotund rat, who was pictured by PDSA staff in Swansea . ‘I do give in to her begging far too often,’ Mrs Maguire said. ‘I have four rescue cats and when I feed them she’s hovering around and grabs any food she can. I have to shut her in another room and feed them on the table. ‘Even then, if I turn my back for a moment she’ll be straight in, she’ll steal and eat all the cats’ food given the slightest chance.’ According to a poll of 1,000 pet owners carried out by PDSA, nearly half do not realise weight is a problem for their pets. The problem is particularly acute for dogs. The estimate more than six million dogs - about 75 per cent - in the UK are exercised for less than an hour a day. The problem is getting worse, with fewer dogs than ever being properly exercised, fuelling an explosion in canine obesity. Warning: The PDSA says obesity is exploding within the dog population, although many owners don't realise it is a problem. Poppy the pug (pictured) has been on a diet since she was rescued from a puppy farm . Diet: Tina, an overweight border terrier with PDSA veterinary nurse Laura Meiklejohn at Edinburgh . Chunky: Guy the cat weighed in a 10kg, or 22lb - medium sized cats should weigh about half that . Walkies: Bobby, a labrador from Dundee, could do with more exercise - like six million dogs in the UK . Separate research found that 2.7million - a third of British dogs - are not being given daily off-lead exercise, an increase of 600,000 since 2011. Vets say obesity in animals creates the same health risks as it does in humans. Overweight pets develop deadly conditions such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes, as well as debilitating conditions including arthritis. Dr Philippa Yam, of Glasgow University’s School of Veterinary Medicine, said: ‘It’s clear that pet obesity continues to be a major issue due to a lack of understanding about pets’ welfare needs.’ Running: Research has found that 2.7million - a third of British dogs - are not being given daily off-lead exercise. Duke the Labrador, pictured going for a stroll in Cardiff, weighs 61kg, but should be 28 to 30kgs . Hope: The owners of Zorro the cat from Dundee managed to get its weight under control once more . PDSA is encouraging owners to join its Pet Fit Club competition - an annual contest to help reduce animals’ weight. Nicola Martin, head of pet health at PDSA, said: ‘Our research has shown that pet obesity is a growing problem and that too many people are continuing to feed their pets inappropriate foods including takeaways, cake, cheese and chips and sadly many pets aren’t getting enough exercise. ‘Over the past decade, Pet Fit Club has transformed the lives of some of the UK’ s most obese pets, having helped nearly 100 animals shed over 60 stone so we are welcoming entries again and offering our expertise.’

Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Chelsea are one of three teams still unbeaten in this season’s Champions League, alongside Porto and Real Madrid. Chelsea are unbeaten at home against French opposition, all encounters taking place in the Champions League (W4 D2). They have kept five clean sheets in those six games. Fernando Morientes is the last player to score for a French club at Stamford Bridge, it was in the 2003/04 semi-final between Chelsea and Monaco. Chelsea have scored in each of their last 18 Champions League home games. The last time they failed to find the net at Stamford Bridge was in April 2011 against Manchester Utd. 50% of Chelsea’s goals in the Champions League this season have come from set-pieces (9 out of 18), the highest ratio among the 16 teams left in the competition. Chelsea only had two shots in the first leg against Paris SG. Their second and last attempt was Branislav Ivanovic’s goal in the 36th minute. Branislav Ivanovic (centre) heads the ball towards goal to put Chelsea 1-0 in front at the Parc des Princes . Paris SG have reached the knockout stages of the Champions League for the third consecutive season, their best ever run. They were knocked out in the quarter finals in the last two campaigns.

Article text: (CNN)Tiger Woods won't be playing at Arnold Palmer's charity tournament next week, but he still hopes to be lining up with the golf legend at the season's opening major. While the 85-year-old Palmer has vowed to overcome a shoulder injury to fulfil his ceremonial tee-off role at the Masters, Woods is still trying to get his game in shape. The former world No. 1 has competed only twice this year, missing the cut at the Phoenix Open in early February before withdrawing in the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open due to his ongoing back problems. "Tiger called me personally to let me know that he wouldn't be playing here at Bay Hill," Palmer said on his PGA Tour event's website. "He said that his game is not quite ready yet and that he was disappointed that he won't be able to play in the tournament, which has always meant a lot to him. I'm sorry that he won't be playing. We'll certainly miss him, but I understand and appreciated that he called me." Woods has won the Arnold Palmer Invitational a record eight times, the last of which came in 2013. However, he has not added to his total of 14 major wins since 2008, but hopes to be in contention at Augusta from April 9-12. "I've put in a lot of time and work on my game and I'm making strides, but like I've said, I won't return to the PGA Tour until my game is tournament ready and I can compete at the highest level," the 39-year-old said on his website. "I hope to be ready for the Masters, and I will continue to work hard preparing for Augusta." Palmer first hosted the Bay Hill tournament in 1979 and it took his name from 2007. It raises money for two Florida hospitals named for the seven-time major winner and his late wife Winnie. "I am so proud of what has been accomplished at the hospitals over the past 25 years. It is always a privilege to know that we are making a difference in the lives of families throughout the community," said Palmer after his medical center was named one of the best for children in the U.S. for 2014-15. He hurt his shoulder in December after tripping on carpet when he was about to make a speech at a PGA Tour father/son event. World No. 1 Rory McIlroy will make his first appearance at Palmer's March 19-22 tournament, which features a restricted field, while top-five players Bubba Watson, Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott and Jason Day will also take part.

Article text: (CNN)ISIS militants kidnapped 20 foreigners working at a Libyan hospital, then released them -- under the condition, if they want to live, that they stay put so they can treat members of the Islamist extremist group, a hospital official said. About 30 gunmen tied to the group calling itself the Islamic State stormed Ibn Sina Hospital in Sirte on Monday while a bus was waiting to take the workers to Tripoli, Libya's capital. The medical workers were later released and sent back to their homes near the medical facility, a hospital official said Tuesday. But they can't go far, with ISIS militants ordering them not to leave Sirte, according to the official. One of those kidnapped, a doctor from Uzbekistan, was told he is safe as long as he didn't leave, and he treated any militants who were wounded, the hospital official said. "They told him that, for your life, you (stay) and work in the city," the official added. Like the doctor, the other medical workers aren't Libyan. Most are from the Philippines, with others from Ukraine, India and Serbia. The kidnappings came days after people of Filipino, Austrian, Czech, Ghanaian and Bangladeshi descent were taken from Libya's Al-Ghani oil field, an operation that Libya's internationally recognized government blamed on "ISIS militias." The abductions are more evidence of the turmoil Libya has experienced since 2011, the start of an uprising against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Sirte was Gadhafi's hometown, where he was killed, and where his loyalists held out the longest. In the years since, Sirte has become a home to ISIS. The coastal city, halfway between Tripoli and Benghazi, is where terrorists kidnapped 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt in separate incidents in December and January. That mass abduction was followed by mass slaughter -- one that, in ISIS' distinctive, depraved style, was videotaped and disseminated as propaganda, showing jihadists standing behind their orange-clad, handcuffed victims and then beheading them. "The sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in," a masked English-speaking jihadi said on the video, "we swear to Allah, we will mix it with your blood." Like the Egyptians, the medical workers kidnapped Monday are foreigners, having come to Sirte to work. They also have skills that could help ISIS. The Ibn Sina Hospital official believes the extremist group went after the workers -- who'd been trying to flee Sirte's precarious security situation -- because they make up the only medical team there and might be needed to treat ISIS militants. The large-scale kidnapping illustrates how ISIS has become a disruptive force in Africa. The group's main foothold is in Iraq and Syria, where it has ruthlessly conquered territory and threatened to take more despite efforts by local governments and a U.S.-led air campaign. ISIS branched out into Libya last year, with CNN reporting in November that fighters loyal to the group had complete control of Derna, a city of about 100,000 near the Egyptian border. Militants who've pledged allegiance to ISIS also have made their mark in points westward, forming chapters in cities including Sirte, Benghazi and Tripoli, according to Noman Benotman, a former Libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism as head of the Quilliam Foundation. Besides its actions in Derna and Sirte, ISIS' Libyan branch claimed responsibility for a January attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli that killed 10 people, one of them American David Berry. But ISIS isn't just active in Libya. Earlier this month, Boko Haram -- another Islamist extremist group with its own reputation for mass abductions and craven brutality -- pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This bond gives ISIS a gateway to West Africa and specifically to Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and Boko Haram's home.

Article text: Caracas (CNN)Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday an unspecified number of Americans were arrested "a few days ago" for engaging in espionage and recruitment activities. The President said they included an American pilot of Latin American origin, arrested in the southwest border state of Táchira. He said the pilot was found in possession of "all kinds of documents" and was being interrogated by the authorities, though he did not identify him. The Venezuelan government has made many similar claims in recent years, without ever substantiating them. Maduro also announced Saturday a series of measures, including visa requirements for U.S. citizens and the downsizing of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, to counteract what he called U.S. "interference" in his country. Venezuela has in recent weeks accused the United States of being behind an alleged coup plot. Speaking at an "anti-imperialist" rally in the capital, Maduro said visas would now be required for all U.S. visitors and that the U.S. Embassy in Caracas would now need foreign ministry approval for any meetings. The Embassy, which he said had more than 100 staff, is to be reduced to a number closer to the 17 Venezuelan diplomats based in Washington. Moreover, a group of prominent U.S. officials, current and retired, will be banned from entering Venezuela because of what Maduro said was their involvement in "bombing Iraq, Syria and Vietnam" and other "terrorist" actions. The officials include George W. Bush, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, former CIA Director George Tenet and several current members of Congress, including Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Bob Menendez and Mario Diaz-Balart. Following the Maduro's announcement Diaz-Balart reacted via Twitter, saying he has "always wanted to travel to a corrupt country that is not a free democracy. And now Castro's lap dog won't let me!" The move comes after the U.S. government last month approved a law under which Venezuelan officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their U.S. assets frozen. A relatively small, but noisy crowd, dressed mostly in revolutionary red, applauded and cheered the measures announced by the President from a platform outside the presidential palace in downtown Caracas. Four missionaries from Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Devils Lake, North Dakota  were released by Venezuelan authorities on Saturday, a church official said. Pastor Bruce Dick said the missionaries arrived in Venezuela on February 20 and were detained a few days ago. "We love the Venezuelan people and have served alongside them for over 12 years," Dick said. "We have been praying along with hundreds or thousands of others for their release and for those in Venezuela who also have been affected by this." It is unclear if the detention and release of these Americans is connected to Maduro's charges of espionage. Journalist Phil Gunson reported from Caracas. CNN's Juan Carlos Lopez, Florencia Trucco and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.

Article text: Amazon.com and caffeine powder distributors didn't provide proper warnings about the supplement's dangers, resulting in the death of an Ohio high school student last year, the teen's father said in a lawsuit filed Friday. Logan Stiner, 18, was just days from graduating high school in northeast Ohio when, on May 27, his brother found him unresponsive in the family's home in LaGrange, southwest of Cleveland. A coroner ruled that Stiner died of cardiac arrhythmia and seizure due to acute caffeine toxicity. The amount of caffeine in his system was about 23 times greater than the level in a typical soda or coffee drinker. Scroll down for video . Cardiac arrest: Logan Stiner, 18, a popular student who was voted prom king and was on the wrestling team, died in May after ingesting about 23 times the amount of caffeine found in a typical coffee or soda . Contentious: Stiner's parents have claimed in a lawsuit the caffeine supplement their son bought on Amazon, called Hard Rhino, was not properly packaged pharmaceutical-grade powder . Family torn apart: Katie and Denis Stiner (pictured with Logan, right, and younger son Dylan, left) are suing Amazon.com and caffeine powder distributors . Stiner was a popular student who was voted prom king, wrestled and planned to study chemical engineering at the University of Toledo. The lawsuit names as defendants a classmate who gave Stiner the caffeine powder; Amazon, which shipped it to the woman last March; and six Arizona-based companies that the father's attorney said packaged and sold the pharmaceutical-grade powder under the name Hard Rhino. The lawyer, Brian Balser, said Friday that the Arizona companies appear to be related. An Amazon.com Inc. spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit. Messages left with the Arizona companies were not returned. There is no number listed for the former classmate. Balser said that after the death of a college student in Georgia in June and a consumer warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Hard Rhino stopped selling caffeine powder on Amazon. Balser said, however, that he ordered powdered caffeine from another company off the Internet two weeks ago. 'It's still out there,' he said. The lawsuit focuses on the Hard Rhino package label. Popular: Logan Stiner was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on caffeine . The lawsuit says the package informed users that a cup of coffee contains about 1/32nd of a teaspoon of caffeine. The package label also warned that the powder 'can be dangerous if abused,' and 'failure to follow safety guidelines can result in serious injury or death,' the lawsuit said. The lawsuit claims that the label lacked specific instructions on proper use. 'The difference between life and death is a pinch and a smidgen,' Balser said. Hard Rhino sold the powder as a dietary supplement, which allows the company to bypass FDA regulations, Balser said. The attorney said Amazon has a team of compliance specialists that is supposed to review products before they are allowed to be sold through the site. The lawsuit seeks damages of more than $25,000. Denis and Katie Stiner have previously urged federal regulators to ban the sale of such substances. 'Before May 27, 2014, we had never heard of "caffeine powder." Now we think about it every day,' the Stiners said in a statement in December.

Article text: Washington (CNN)Updates on Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and John Kasich, an economic twist on the old adage "All politics is local," and an overseas vote where President Obama would love to see an anti-incumbent backlash -- those stories filled our Sunday trip around the "Inside Politics" table. The official White House line will be something like this: The Israeli people are making their choice, the United States admires their vibrant democracy and looks forward to a close friendship and strategic partnership with the next Israeli government no matter who wins. But it's no secret President Obama is no fan of Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Israeli prime minister's recent address to a joint meeting of the Congress exposed the rawness of the relationship. So as the votes are counted and the coalitions debated in the week ahead, the White House has both a personal and professional interest. NPR's Steve Inskeep took a firsthand look at the Israeli campaign in the final days and offered his take on the uncertainty. "Now, Israel's political system is so complicated that even if (Netanyahu's) party ends up not being the leading party, there are scenarios where he could end up in a governing coalition," said Inskeep. "But it's interesting to note that Isaac Herzog, the Labor Party leader, who's his biggest challenger, wants to change Israel's approach to the world -- has been talking about trying to end Israel's isolation in the world, which would suggest changing a lot of policies that have infuriated this White House or frustrated this White House over the last several years." Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tend to be at the top of GOP presidential polls these days, and a good deal has been written of late about a growing rivalry. But Maggie Haberman of The New York Times took us inside some recent big-money conversations during which Walker took a more diplomatic approach when asked about his potential nomination rival. Walker was in New York City last week for fund-raising meet and greets, and he met with some hedge fund executives who were very impressed by him. New York Observer owner Jared Kushner was also on hand. "He was asked how he would beat Jeb Bush, and he surprised a bunch of people by saying Jeb Bush is the front-runner," said Haberman. "Now, that's contrary to a lot of other things he said publicly last week." "But that is his sell to people who could give him money, which is: 'No, no, (Bush) is the front-runner but I'm the slow and steady guy who's going to come up behind, just like when I ran track when I was younger.'" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at times appears to be the odd man out in the early GOP presidential rankings. Jeb Bush's aggressive entry into the race raised some questions about whether there would still be space for Rubio to tap Florida's deep fund-raising well. Then came the Scott Walker boomlet, and talk among some conservatives that the Wisconsin governor -- not Rubio -- might be the best pick for a new generation GOP standard-bearer. But Rubio has continued to build his team and travel to the early states on the nomination calendar, and Robert Costa of The Washington Post shared news of a developing relationship between the senator and the party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney. "He's spoken with Romney twice since Romney decided not to get in the race," said Costa.  "And he has had meetings this week with people like Lanhee Chen, Romney's former policy director, and texts often with Spencer Zwick, Romney's former finance director." "I think Rubio, if he nurtures those relationships, we'll see him continue to rise in the donor community and with consultants and voters." Ohio Gov. John Kasich is about to make his first New Hampshire foray of the 2016 cycle and is getting some encouragement from important players in the first-in-the-nation primary state. Kasich, who is exploring running but hasn't been as aggressive as many other GOPers in terms of travel and staff recruitment, will be in New Hampshire on March 24 for the Politics and Eggs breakfast, a rite of presidential passage sponsored by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. Word from people familiar with the trip is that Kasich is being encouraged to be more active in New Hampshire by former Gov. John H. Sununu and his son, former GOP Sen. John Sununu. Two New Hampshire GOP activists also report that former GOP Sen. Judd Gregg also believes Kasich -- like Gregg, a budget hawk during his time in Congress -- would be a strong addition to the GOP field. There is a crowded field of Republicans testing the waters for 2016 -- and the people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina are grateful. They don't have as much reason to be grateful to the Democrats, who so far seem to be fixated on a single candidate. The lack of a big field will likely spare Hillary Clinton a damaging mess, as California Gov. Jerry Brown suggested last week. But, party loyalties aside, perhaps he would have a different take if his state were near the top of the nominating calendar. Julie Pace of The Associated Press reminded us the early presidential attention is an economic engine in those early states. "When you have robust primaries in both parties, you have tons of money flooding into Iowa and New Hampshire, South Carolina, on television ads, on hotels, transportation, campaign headquarters," said Pace. "And there is some concern that on the Democratic side, we're just simply not going to see that this time around." "And it's a reminder that politics has become such a big business beyond just the campaigns and the super PACs."

Article text: Grayson Perry's unusual Gingerbread House holiday home has been branded an 'abomination' by local villagers inundated with art fans flocking to see the property. The Turner Prize-winning artist teamed up with the organisation Living Architecture to design the unique holiday cottage in the sleepy village of Wrabness. But locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist's creation are clogging up the narrow streets. Scroll down for video . The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie' The quirky cottage was supposed to 'explore the special character and unique qualities of Essex' and is expected to open for holiday bookings in the spring. But the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans. One frustrated villager, who refused to be named, said: 'This is a tiny village known for its tranquillity. 'We're not a snotty London art gallery, yet our tiny roads are now besieged on a daily basis by day trippers asking for directions to the dreaded 'Gingerbread House'. 'I can only imagine how bad it will be in the summer. 'I still do not understand how this abomination got planning permission in the first place?' Wrabness Parish Council strongly objected to the proposal to knock down the existing farmhouse and replace it with the imposing structure that combines sculptures, tapestries and ceramics. Villagers in Wrabness have said that Grayson Perry's 'Gingerbread house' has caused traffic chaos . The Turner Prize-winning artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics, and right, the house in honour to a mythical Essex woman called 'Julie' The original plans for the home were turned down by Tendring District Council but a re-submitted application for the wacky home was given the green-light by planners. The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie'. Perry admitted he had originally designed the house whilst ‘doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television’. The house is located on the banks of the River Stour, in the rural village of Wrabness . He wanted it to resemble a ‘jewel box’ that told the story of a mythical Essex woman called Julie, who had a difficult childhood, love life, divorce and late career. Hence, there’s an 8ft statue of her on the roof, naked and pregnant, and her name is emblazoned all over the walls. Essex County Council Highways Authority have now agreed to redesign tiny local roads to improve access to the site. Talks are also ongoing to use the nearby Wrabness Railway Station as a car park for art enthusiasts. The cottage - officially named 'A House for Essex' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months . An Essex Highways spokesman said: 'Following a meeting, it was agreed to implement a number of requests for road improvements in Black Boy Lane, Wrabness. 'These include a variety of new and replacement road signs and renewed and repositioned road markings. 'Cllrs Bass and Johnson also agreed to write to NCP and National Rail to encourage them to discuss parking issues with the parish council.' The cottage - officially named 'A House for Essex' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months. Grayson Perry was contacted for comment but has yet to respond.

The 27-year-old anchorman is out of contract at the Santiago Bernabeu in the summer and will be available on a free transfer; but factoring in Khedira's obvious quality and reported interest from Arsenal and Manchester United, it is not hard to see why Di Matteo feels signing him will be a challenge.

Real Madrid's Germany international midfielder Sami Khedira is out of contract at the end of the season . Schalke boss Roberto Di Matteo is interested in signing Khedira but accepts it will be a tough challenge .

However, I think he is spoilt for choice when it comes to picking his next destination. It will be very difficult to take him to Schalke.' Khedira joined Madrid from Stuttgart in 2010 and has since made over 150 appearances for Los Blancos, winning La Liga in 2012 and the Champions League in 2014. He was also part of Germany's FIFA World Cup winning squad that lifted the trophy in Brazil in July last year.

Jenny Clark, from Bournemouth, Dorset, ballooned to a size 18 when she was pregnant with her son Mason and once he was born, decided to join a gym to lose the weight.

'Through exercise and diet I'd managed to lose a bit of weight. I was doing a gym class and I was the only one who turned up. 'My gym instructor must have been watching me more closely because it was just me and she said I was really symmetrical and had I ever tried bodybuilding.' Weigh to go: Mason tries lifting the weights for himself while mum Jenny trains . Young Mason loves nothing more than seeing his mother in action . Jenny, who is a tattoo artist, said her husband, Dominic, used to be a bodybuilder and encouraged her to give it a go. She said: 'We went along to a show and I decided I wanted to do it. 'In my first competition I came last out of five people in my category and I was absolutely mortified. 'I'd put in so much work and I was just gutted but I signed up for another competition two weeks later and came fourth out of five. Jenny's husband Dominic takes a closer look at his wife's bodybuilding trophy . In safe hands: Using to lifting heavy weights, Mason is as light as a feather by comparison . 'Doing that first competition I never imagined I would now be world champion. 'I like the way I look on stage. You have to learn how to pose properly so it shows your physique off to its best. 'Even when I'm not at competitions I still get a lot of positive comments about the way I look. 'I'm not as lean as I am during competitions, but I still have quite a bit of muscle definition. 'At the beach it's usually guys that comment, saying things like "check out how big her muscles are", I think they're probably jealous! 'I don't take anything to heart because everyone has different ideas of what's attractive.'

Article text: Casey Stoney believes she is in the form of her life. Now all she has to do is convince England coach Mark Sampson before the women’s World Cup in Canada in June. The former England and GB captain has only played once for her country since Sampson took over from Hope Powell 15 months ago. Stoney, 32, is in the squad for the Cyprus Cup tournament, which starts on Wednesday with a match against Finland. Casey Stoney (centre, pictured in July 2013) is hoping to worm her way back into the England fold . The 32-year-old captained Great Britain during the 2012 Olympic Games in London . The central defender, who has 117 caps, was voted players' player of the year at Arsenal in the last Women's Super League season. She was left out of England's squad for the 3-0 friendly defeat by Germany at Wembley in November and was an unused substitute for the 1-0 defeat by the USA at MK Dons last month. England face four games in just over a week in the annual friendly tournament in Cyprus and Stoney told Fanbookz.com that she feels she merits a recall. ‘My actual form last season was my best since the Women's Super League started,’ she said. ‘When I go away with England I feel I'm competitive and working really hard, so that's all I can keep doing. I'm delighted to be in the England squad and if the opportunity comes, hopefully I can take it. ‘I've played 117 games for England and kept clean sheets against the best teams in the world, so I know that I can do it. It's just a matter of getting the opportunity to show it. Stoney has played just one game for her country under Mark Sampson, who replaced Hope Powell in 2013 . ‘This will be a good chance for the team to try different players and game plans but for me personally, with four matches in just over a week, this is an opportunity to play and show what I can still do.’ Steph Houghton, who succeeded Stoney as captain, and either Lucy Bronze or Laura Bassett have been selected in the centre of defence in recent games. Stoney points to her best fitness results over the lose season, since recovering from a hip injury. ‘You can never lose what you never had and I was never quick in the first place,’ added Stoney. ‘I continue to work hard on trying to read the game well, understanding what's likely to happen. Getting good detail on the opposition allows me to feel one step ahead.’ England play Australia and the Netherlands in their other group games before finishing up with a fourth friendly in Cyprus. At the World Cup in Canada they face France, Mexico and Colombia.

Article text: A Virginia teenager was arrested Friday for helping a man travel to Syria in order to join ISIS forces, according to a report. The 17-year-old was taken into custody during an FBI raid on the teen's home in Woodbridge, neighbors said. The Washington Post reports that the boy, who is a student at Osbourn Park High School in nearby Manassas, is being charged as a juvenile, although officials are working to try him as an adult. High schooler: FBI officials arrested a 17-year-old in connection with a man who traveled to Syria and joined up with ISIS . According to officials whose names were withheld by the paper, the teenager allegedly used online contacts to help another slightly older man travel to Syria and link up with ISIS. Officials said they conducted surveillance on the home for about a month before the teenager's arrest. The man who traveled to Syria is expected to face charges, according to officials, who also looked into another 17-year-old student at Osbourn Park, before judging him to have played a much smaller role. A neighbor said that FBI officials knocked on the front and back doors of the home before someone inside opened up. The boy was later led out in handcuffs, with the officials also carrying a computer and other electronic equipment, the neighbor said. Though she did not give her name, the neighbor said that the boy had attended middle school with her daughter and that in spite of spending most his time in the home, remarked the boy seemed like a typical teenager. Drawn to extremism: The man helped by the teenager in Woodbridge successfully reached Syria through contacts overseas to join up with ISIS (file photo) The boy's alleged online ties to individuals close to the Islamist extremist group surprised some who knew him as a smart young man interested in business and technology. 'He was a brilliant kid,' said Dustin O’Bryant, who hired the teenager to write  for his site Coin Brief. 'His English wasn’t perfect, but I was willing to overlook that because the content was great.' O'Bryant said he hired the teenager for the site, which covers BitCoin and other digital currencies, after being impressed by a chemistry paper the boy wrote. He 'had a really strong understanding of the technology behind digital currency in general and even more advanced systems,' O'Bryant said. BuzzFeed reports that the teenager had not communicated with O'Bryant, who lives in Alabama, since February, when he told him he was going through personal issues. 'He in no way came across as any sort of extremist,' O'Bryant said. 'My hope is that there was some kind of misunderstanding, that he didn’t know who he was helping.'

Article text: A married father murdered a mother-of-two in her apartment before stealing her credit cards and using her car in a hit-and-run, police have said. Lyle Robert London, 38, has been arrested in the murder of Lindsay Brown Holbrook, a 32-year-old divorced mom he knew. She was found dead in her Washington Terrace, Utah home on Friday night. Sheriff's deputies had gone to the apartment after her car was involved in a hit-and-run, but when she failed to answer her door, they entered the home and found her desecrated body inside. She had suffered an apparent trauma but the cause of her death remains under investigation. Her body could have been there for a few days, Fox13 reported. Murdered: Lindsay Brown Holbrook, 32, was allegedly murdered by Lyle Robert London, right, inside her Utah apartment. Her body was found as police investigated a hit-and-run involving her vehicle . Tragic: Holbrook, who was divorced and lives alone, leaves behind her young daughter and son (pictured) Through evidence found in her car and witness accounts, police determined that London had been behind the wheel at the scene of the crash earlier that evening. Authorities say he knew his alleged victim, but would not detail how - only calling them 'associates'. Arrested: London's wife Shuree, 35, has also been arrested on suspicion of obstruction of justice . 'It is believed that he murdered her in her apartment and then tried to conceal the crime,' Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Lane Findlay said in a press release. Although police have not released a motive for the killing, after murdering the woman, London then took her financial cards and completed several fraudulent transactions, Findlay added. He was then involved in the hit-and-run accident near 3000 Washington Boulevard, police believe. A neighbor added to Fox13 that they had seen London going in and out of Holbrook's home in the days before her body was found. London was arrested at his Ogden home on suspicion of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, abuse and desecration of a human body, and unlawful possession and use of a financial card. His wife, 35-year-old Shuree Laness London, was also arrested at a nearby hotel on suspicion of obstruction of justice. She allegedly 'had knowledge of this crime and assisted Mr. London after the fact,' Findlay said in the press release. Both are being held in the Weber County jail. Their Facebook profiles show they have been married for 13 years and have several children together - but Mrs London wrote on February 20 that they were having marital problems. 'I can honestly say we are going through a VERY VERY DIFFICULT time right now,' she wrote on her husband's profile. Family: The couple, pictured with their children, have numerous arrests between them, court records show . Shortly afterwards, she posted a message reading, 'A real relationship is where you can tell each other everything & anything. No secrets, no lies,' adding: 'I worked so hard for nothing.' Court records show that Lyle London has pleaded guilty to several misdemeanor charges since 1999, including possession of drug paraphernalia, intoxication, simple assault, criminal mischief, theft and various traffic violations, the Deseret News reported. His wife pleaded guilty to theft in 2010, as well as several traffic violations. In light of the most recent charges, their friend John Cleveland told Fox13: 'Knowing him and knowing his background that would not surprise me at all.' He added that he had heard London mention Holbrook's name. Facebook shows Holbrook was a mother to two young children, a boy and a girl. Fox13 reported that she was divorced from her husband and that it did not appear the children lived with her. Scene: Her body was found in her first-floor apartment, left, by sheriff's deputies just before midnight on Friday. Authorities have said she apparently suffered trauma but have not yet said how she died . Her family released a statement through the sheriff's office on Sunday afternoon. 'Lindsay was a loving mother, amazing aunt, wonderful sister, and she had an incredible sense of humor,' it said. 'She is loved by a lot of people and will be greatly missed.' An obituary shows that Holbrook's family also lost her younger brother, 27-year-old Nathan Brown, in January 2014. She leaves behind four other siblings. The family has asked for privacy as they grieve and make preparations for her funeral. 'Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to them,' the sheriff's office said. See below for video .

Article text: Determined not to let the Italian court's judgement over whether she was responsible for the murder of Meredith Kercher keep her in hiding, Amanda Knox strolls hand-in-hand with her fiancé. The 27-year-old was joined by musician Colin Sutherland and her mother, Edda Mellas, as they took a brief walk outside her family home in Seattle, Washington, on Thursday evening. Knox and Sutherland, 27,  clasped their hands together but both appeared nervous and sported serious expressions, with neither smiling, as they took advantage of the spring evening. Scroll down for video . Clutch: Amanda Knox and fiancé Colin Sutherland seen going for a stroll on Thursday evening. The Italian court is expected to decide whether or not Knox is guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher today . Tension is in the air as Amanda and Colin take a brief stroll before returning inside home of Amanda's mom . The couple see her mom off as she takes her dogs for a walk. Amanda's mom Edda Mellas walks her dogs. Knox’s family are rallying around her and trying to help her lead as normal a life as possible in the run up to the final decision by the Court of Cassation - Italy's highest court - in Rome on Friday. Shortly before their walk, Sutherland was seen carrying a bag of ice and two bags of shopping into the house, possibly supplies for a long and agonizing night waiting for the verdict. Earlier on Thursday, Amanda – who in 2013 penned memoir Waiting to be Heard about the murder case and her four years in jail - was spotted with her fiance writing on a notepad in the backyard. The Italian court is set to decide if it will uphold a 2013 ruling declaring Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the 2007 killing of the British exchange student. The decision was due on Wednesday but has been delayed. And today, Sollecito's lawyer launched a last-ditch attempt to save his own skin and blow a hole in American's defense. The former lover was compared to a 'Forrest Gump' caught up in events beyond his understanding. Knox and Sollecito had originally been convicted in 2009, but were acquitted in 2011, allowing Knox to fly back to her hometown in the US, although the verdict was then reversed in 2013. There are a number of possible outcomes to the trial: Either both Knox and Sollecito will be found guilty, they will both be declared not guilty, one will be convicted but not the other, or the whole thing could go back for another round of appeal. Even if the trial does end in a conviction, former judge Mike Heavey – who has long championed Knox’s cause and become close to her family, even being invited to her wedding - says he feels there is little chance of her being extradited to Italy for the 28 and a half year sentence she has been handed if convicted. Earlier in the day, sitting in the afternoon sun, Amanda Knox calmly wrote in her journal in mom's backyard . If declared guilty, the decision to extradite Amanda back to Italy ultimately rests in the hand of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry . Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online, he said: ‘I imagine it’s been very tense for [the Knox family]. I’m optimistic the case will be dismissed and they’ll be acquitted. ‘Well respected scientists are coming in and debunking the DNA evidence against them and public opinion [in Italy] has gone from 90% against to around 80% for her. ‘Raffaele was in court Wednesday which is good. They never really aimed at Raffaele, it’s always been Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. Very sexist, by the way, very anti-American. ‘But this has been a witch-hunt, as if it was Salem, Massachusetts, 1691. No different except that it goes global. ‘And it titillates a great percentage of people, they find is fascinating, this idea of a sex orgy gone wrong and two pretty girls that was originally put forward by the prosecution.’ Referring to the 2003 kidnapping and transportation to Egypt of Italian cleric Abu Omar by the CIA and the subsequent conviction in absentia by an Italian court of ex-CIA operative Robert Seldon Lady for that crime, he added: ‘There’s good reasons to dislike the Americans, we’ve done a lot of bad things around the world, I can agree with a lot of their criticisms. Ms Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in Perugia in 2007. The house in Perugia where British student Meredith Kercher was murdered aged just 21 in November 2007 . Raffaele Sollecito is pictured leaving Rome's Supreme Court on Wednesday as Italy's top judges delayed  a ruling on whether to uphold his and Amanda Knox's conviction for the murder of student Meredith Kercher . Rudy Guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in Kercher's death after a separate trial . ‘Our CIA kidnapped an Islamic cleric, an Italian citizen, and they can’t get their minister of justice to ask the US for an extradition, they can’t get it done, so they’re frustrated. ‘[But in this case] Raffaele is collateral damage. If we confirm their convictions, we send an innocent Italian man – and the people probably won’t like that – to prison, and the [Italian] Minister of Justice probably won’t even ask for extradition, but even if he did are they going to pick a fight with the United states of America on a false claim? ‘The kidnapping of an Italian citizen – that’s a legitimate claim and they still don’t want to take on the USA. So are they going to take on the US on a B.S. claim? ‘No. It’s a fraud, and everybody knows it and everybody is playing along.' If Knox is declared guilty, the decision to extradite her back to Italy ultimately rests in the hand of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry.

Article text: (CNN)From the community of Montoursville, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., to the community of Haltern am See, Germany: . We offer our heartfelt condolences for the pain you must be feeling at this time after the loss of 16 students and two teachers in the horrendous crash of Germanwings Flight 9525. There are no words of comfort that we could express that would ever be adequate. We know something about this sorrow. Almost 19 years ago our community lost 16 high school French Club students, along with five chaperones, in the crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island, New York. It is impossible to be prepared for such a horrific tragedy that touches so many so personally. During the dark hours of waiting for word of possible survivors from Flight 800, the pain for the family members was excruciating. As word came that there were no survivors, that all hope was extinguished, the anguish became almost unbearable. Students, former students, teachers and other community members began to fill the hallways of the high school building because they didn't know where else to go to find consolation. Local pastors, priests, teachers and counselors were also gathering at the school to offer whatever comfort could be offered in such a moment. Within hours, phone calls began pouring in from former students and teachers who were now living outside the area, offering condolences and prayers for all. Since the disaster occurred over water, the recovery of loved ones took days, and even weeks in some cases.  Positive identification of each individual lost took even longer, which only added to the anguish. The identifications came in one at a time over a period of several days; the waiting was nearly impossible to bear. School was not in session during the summer months, so students and school staff members were able to express their sense of loss as they felt necessary at any time. A community prayer service was arranged and held in the high school gymnasium to provide a place to weep together, and to share each other's pain. Local pastors and priests provided ongoing support to the families who had lost family members, and this continued for several months. Some struggled so deeply that professional counseling was suggested. Because we are a community of about 5,000 with just one high school, almost everyone opened their arms of support to those in deepest need by providing meals, baby-sitting, housecleaning and laundry services. Funeral services were held one at a time, some in the high school and others in local churches. Long lines of mourners waited in silence for the opportunity to at least offer condolences to family members. Twenty-one funeral services over a period of several days left many in the community without any more tears to cry. Within a couple of months, a memorial service was held on the local athletic field and attended by thousands. The hope was to bring closure for the community so it could attempt to return to a somewhat normal daily routine. This helped for some, but families that experienced direct loss still had a long and painful journey ahead of them.  When a parent, or someone serving as a parent, loses a child, an empty spot occurs in the heart that never heals. They may find comfort in the thought that their child is in the arms of a loving God, but that assurance does not mend the broken heart. Over time, the various families that lost their children in the tragedy formed support groups to share their loss. Many of the folks have reached out to others going through a similar type of loss to offer their comfort, and have found a little bit of personal healing in the process. In the years since the crash, many of the pastors and priests who served the families have moved away or retired from pastoral service. Those of us who counseled from the beginning have at times needed the support of one another to restore our strength and spirits to then be able to serve our own parishioners. This is the beginning of a very long journey for all those willing to serve those in such great pain at this time. At this writing I am shedding tears just recalling the events that started almost 19 years ago. If any of our experiences can assist your community of Haltern am See in getting through this horrible event, then know that it is in pain we achieve our greatest victories.

Article text: As one of the UK’s most popular fast food chains, it sells almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. But now conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23million chickens a year can be shown for the first time. The images show tens of thousands of chickens kept together in huge sheds, alive for just 35 days before they are gassed. Scroll down for video . Life on the farm: Supplier Andrew in the shed filled with 34,00 chickens destined for the fast food chain KFC . The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed . A documentary tonight shows the birds living amid their excrement in conditions activists say are ‘oppressive’ – but the farmer in charge claims it’s ‘a very good life’. Footage to be screened this evening on BBC1 focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows. When they are large enough the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to warehouses in large trays where they are then distributed to branches nationwide. The farmer in charge claimed the birds had 'a very good life' and showed how they were healthy . Farms supply KFC with around 23 million chickens each year and its chains sell almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. At one farm around 34,000 chickens are penned into sheds with few windows . About 1,000 farms in the country supply KFC with 23million chickens a year. The programme focuses on a farmer called Andrew who says the chickens at his farm – left to do nothing but eat and drink until they reach the required weight – have a good life, saying he ‘wouldn’t mind being a chicken in here’. Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: ‘No, no, no, that’s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.’ The supplier, who has 35 years’ experience, says: ‘As you can see, they’ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they’ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can’t think there’s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.’ Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: ‘No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.’ Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: ‘These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays . The trays of chicken are then distributed to KFC branches nationwide and sold to customers . This is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . ‘Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. ‘These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter. A great number suffer broken bones during this process.’ A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers ‘an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK’s most recognisable businesses’. It is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. A KFC spokesman said: ‘Animal welfare is essential for high quality food and is important to our customers, and all of KFC’s suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements. KFC was the first quick-service restaurant to gain Red Tractor certification and we have in place our own robust standard, which is independently audited by third parties.’ Episode one of The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop airs on BBC1 at 9pm.

Training with his Colombia team-mates in Barhain ahead of the South American country's mini-Asian tour, Falcao was warmly embraced by one supporter who ran on the pitch to reach him. The young fan, wearing one of United's replica away kits managed to get a selfie with Falcao and the striker's signature on the front of his shirt before being escorted away by security staff.

Falcao duly obliges with a hug while training on international duty with his Colombia team-mates . Falcao signs the youngster's replica United shirt as security staff come over to escort him away . Security take the boy away from the Colombia squad, but he will no doubt be happy with his actions . The hug will no doubt come as a lift for Falcao who is under huge pressure to improve his poor club form. Previously viewed as one of the game's top marksmen while at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco, the Colombian has failed to reach those same heights since agreeing to a big-money loan deal at Old Trafford. United manager Louis van Gaal has been so unimpressed with Falcao's performances that the striker has even been made to spend time training with the club's Under-21s team. Falcao has struggled to replicate the sort of form he showed while at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal at one point demoted Falcao to the club's Under 21s team .

Article text: Killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 'passionate and obsessed' with the French Alps and used to enjoy regular holidays with his family just miles from the Germanwings crash site, it has emerged. The 27-year-old, who deliberately downed Flight 4U9525 killing all 150 people on board, dreamed of becoming a pilot from a young age and frequented a gliding club just 30 miles from the crash site with his parents as a child. Francis Kefer, a member of a flying club in Sisteron, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence where the Airbus A320 crashed, said that Lubitz and his family regularly visited the region between 1996 and 2003. He also took part in flights over the province as a teenager, before later completing a gliding course in the area, which he was said to be 'well-acquainted' with. Scroll down for video . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (above) had an obsession with the French Alps and used to fly gliders over the mountainside where he brought down a Germanwings flight, killing all 150 crew and passengers on board . Lubitz regularly visited the French Alps with his family as a youngster and as he grew older he took training courses during which he learnt to fly gliders over the mountainside where he brought down the Airbus A320 . Lubitz deliberately crashed the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 into the mountains on Tuesday after locking his captain out of the cockpit. He is said to have remained calm as he drove the plane directly into the ground . Lubitz brought down the passenger plane in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence on Tuesday. The crash site is just 30 miles from the Aero-club de Sisteron glider airfield, which Lubitz visited regularly as a child with his parents . Dieter Wagner, a member of Luftsportclub Westerwald – the gliding association where Lubitz first learnt to fly aged 14 – said: ‘He was passionate about the Alps, even obsessed with them.’ The 70-year-old added to Le Parisien: ‘Andreas participated in courses in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence with my niece, who was a good friend to him. ‘I am sure he knew the area of the crash because he had flown over it in a glider.’ The flying club, which is situated in Lubitz’s hometown of Montabaur, Germany, confirmed that the co-pilot had taken part in glider training sessions with the club’s partner firm in Sisteron - a town in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence of France. The Aero-club de Sisteron glider airfield, which is popular with glider pilots thanks to its numerous peaks and valleys and stunning panoramas, is situated just 30 miles away from the crash site. An unnamed source told France's Metro News that Lubitz, who would have been nine-years-old when the family started holidaying in the region, seemed a 'normal boy'. Lubitz first sat in the cockpit of a light aircraft at the age of 14 and, after a couple of years of instruction under dual controls, was able to fly on his own. One friend said he was desperate to become a pilot and  'would have died' if he had not passed his flying exams. He even became a flight attendant while he waited to start his training. After obtaining his pilot's licence, Lubitz regularly returned to the French region and, according to local glider pilots, overflew the major turning points in the region, flying from one peak to another. Ernst Müller, a member of Luftsportclub Westerwald aviation club, said: ‘I am certain that Andreas has participated at least once or two internships with us in Sisteron.’ Lubitz eventually went on to become a co-pilot for Germanwings in 2013 but his training was interrupted by a bout of depression and he found it difficult to shake off perceptions that he was not fully up to the demanding job. News of his obsession with the French Alps comes amid claims from German newspaper The Rheinische Post that he may have crashed the plane due to fears he was about to lose his licence on medical grounds. The pilot locked his captain out of the cockpit on Tuesday before setting the Germanwings Flight 4U9525's controls to descend into a rocky valley, obliterating the plane and killing all 150 people on board. Lubitz, a keen runner, had built his whole life around becoming a pilot and even posted pictures of planes all over his bedroom walls as a child. A friend said he 'would have died' if he had not have passed his flying exams . Dieter Wagner, 70 (pictured), a member of Luftsportclub Westerwald – the gliding association where Lubitz first learnt to fly aged 14 – described the killer co-pilot as 'passionate about the Alps, even obsessed with them' Lubitz flew over the province in the southern French Alps where downed the passenger jet as a teenager and later completed gliding lessons over the area. One acquaintance said he was 'obsessed' with the region . A member of the flying club which Lubitz started lessons with as a teenager said he was 'well-acquainted' with the French Alps and regularly flew over the area where he brought down the passenger plane on Tuesday . Investigators revealed yesterday that medical sign-off notes were found at Lubitz's home - including at least one that covered the day of the crash - and Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed he had been a patient there over the past two months, although it would not disclose his condition. More sick notes are said to have covered other days when he flew despite being told not to. However, police said they found no suicide note in a five-hour search. Speaking to MailOnline, an airline spokesman stressed the company was unaware of any medical notes and said it had been Lubitz's responsibility to tell his employers he was unfit to fly. He was facing a potential medical examination that could have seen his pilot's licence removed and it is thought he may have feared mental or other health problems would bring an end to his dream. Former BA pilot Alastair Rosenschein said pilots of Lubitz's age face regular medicals as well as simulator tests and can be grounded if they fail to pass. He told MailOnline: 'He may have known that his career was already over. He may have known that the end was in sight.' Mr Rosenschein said that, in Britain, pilots under 40 face annual or bi-annual medicals and, as well as testing physical health, doctors often ask questions to assess pilots' mental health. He added: 'However, it's difficult to see how a doctor could foresee something like this. There are no rules that someone who is having marital or financial difficulties cannot fly.' In a blunt admission yesterday, Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa which owns the budget airline, admitted Lubitz had slipped through the safety net with devastating consequences. ‘The pilot had passed all his tests, all his medical exams,’ he said. ‘He was 100 per cent fit to fly without any restrictions. 'We have at Lufthansa, a reporting system where crew can report – without being punished – their own problems, or they can report about the problems of others without any kind of punishment. 'All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.’ German investigators removed dozens of boxes from the Dusseldorf apartment Lubitz shared with his girlfriend yesterday, as they continue to search for clues which could explain the reasons behind the air crash . Investigators found a torn up sicknote which was valid on the day of the crash among other evidence . Other possible explanations for Lubitz's actions are that he may have stopped taking his medication so it would not be detected in any medical tests or slipped into desperation during a crisis in his relationship. He is said to have recently split from his on/off girlfriend, who he lived with in a smart flat on the outskirts of Dusseldorf. Some media reports claim the pair were together for seven years and were engaged to be married next year. However, a former lover of Lubitz came forward today to claim she had dated the troubled co-pilot for five months last year. The 26-year-old air Germanwings stewardess said she met Lubitz while the pair flew across Europe together and said they would often stay in hotels together. She said he even warned her that he was going to commit an act so heinous that his name would be remembered for ever. The woman, known only as Maria W, revealed to German newspaper Bild how he ominously told her last year: ‘One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.’ When she heard about the airliner crash, she remembered Lubitz’s menacing prophecy. ‘I never knew what he meant, but now it makes sense,’ she said. Earlier today, a passenger on the outbound flight from Dusseldorf to Barcelona, which is believed to have had Lubitz on board, questioned why the co-pilot didn't down that flight instead. Michael, 45, said he saw the pilot leave the cockpit during the 6.45am flight for a toilet break. He told Bild: 'I sat in the fifth row. I could see the front of the plane. The toilet behind the cockpit was apparently out of order, I could see the red light flashing throughout the flight. 'A man over 40, probably the pilot, in a grey V neck sweater came through the curtain. He went through the plane probably to the rear toilet. 'After an estimated three to five minutes he came back and again opened the cockpit door.' He said he didn't see the co-pilot during the flight but described the journey as 'unobtrusive and 'normal'.

Article text: With less than a week before British Summer Time starts on March 29, British Grooming Time has kicked off in earnest. Do you want to present perfectly primped limbs to the world when the weather heats up and opaque tights and cardies are cast aside? Then you need to get to work. Here, we test the latest beauty gadgets and creams and give them a BGT (British Grooming Time) rating. Scroll down for video . There's less than a week now until British Summer Time starts, after the long winter are you ready to show off your perfectly prepped body to the world? BRIGHTEN DULL HAIR . PROBLEM: Spring sunshine means it’s time to lighten your locks. ‘Going two or three shades lighter will keep hair looking natural, but fresh for spring,’ says Jack Howard, Poppy Delevingne’s colourist at Paul Edmonds salon in Knightsbridge. ‘Or you can freshen up your existing dye job with an at-home mask.’ SOLUTION: I decide to lighten my five-week-old highlights with Maria Nila Golden Blonde Colour Refresh (£16.99, sallyexpress.com, launches on Monday). Maria Nila Golden Blonde Colour Refresh (£16.99, sallyexpress.com) This fruity-smelling non-permanent hair mask promises to revitalise dyed hair using temporary pigments. I do a strand test first, then, reassured, squeeze a little orange-gold liquid into my hand and massage into wet hair. To my relief, my highlights do, indeed, look a couple of shades lighter and my hair is glossy and groomed. BGT rating: 7/10 . REGAIN YOUR GLOW . PROBLEM: ‘The beginning of spring needs to signal the end of lacklustre skin,’ says Dr Mervyn Patterson, cosmetic doctor at Woodford Medical Aesthetics. ‘Months of cold weather and central heating have taken their toll. The top layer of your skin is full of dead cells. Microdermabrasion is a great way to get rid of dead cells and dirt.’ PMD Personal Microderm (£150, harrods.com ) SOLUTION: The PMD Personal Microderm (£150, harrods.com) is a hand-held gadget for at-home microdermabrasion. It looks like an electric toothbrush, but at the end is a clear plastic lid with a hole at the top. Under this is a small, flat head covered in fine aluminium oxide crystals. Read the instructions carefully — this could damage your skin if used incorrectly. Epionce Intensive Nourishing Cream (£79, epionce.co.uk ) I choose a medium-strength head and turn it on, running the end of the nozzle up the back of my hand. There is a faint tingling. I try it on my face, holding the skin taut and running it carefully and slowly up my cheeks and chin. When I’ve finished I look much brighter, my fine lines are reduced and my skin is clear and glowing. I’m impressed with the results around my nostrils, which had lots of blocked pores. Expensive, but seriously effective. I follow this with celebrity favourite, Epionce Intensive Nourishing Cream (£79, epionce.co.uk), for hydration. BGT rating: 9/10 . ULTRA SMOOTH LEGS . PROBLEM: ‘Winter can leave your legs as scaly as a thirsty lizard,’ says Dr Patterson. ‘Those comforting hot baths will have leached away natural hydrating lipids.’ This season’s fashionable ripped jeans and off-the-shoulder tops mean every bit of you needs to be petal-soft. SOLUTION: ‘Exfoliate away dead dry skin and use a rich moisturiser all over,’ says Dr Patterson. Marks & Spencer’s Huile d’Olive Miracle Oil (£10, marksandspencer.com) I whizz up a body scrub by slugging a glug of coconut oil into a jam jar, adding a mound of sea salt and shaking well. I smear the gloop all over me in the shower and get to work with a loofah. After rinsing, I apply Marks & Spencer’s Huile d’Olive Miracle Oil (£10, marksandspencer.com, out at the end of the month). It smells divine and the next morning my skin feels clean and silky. BGT rating: 8/10 . FIRM UP ARMS . PROBLEM: ‘As skin loses collagen with time, it begins to sag, including on your upper arms,’ says Dr Patterson. Not a problem when you can cover up with a cardigan, but tricky in a sleeveless dress. I have noticed that my arms look saggy. I have my eye on some sleeveless tops from Zara, but I’m reluctant to remove my cardies. SOLUTION: Ultrasound waves stimulate collagen production to make skin plump and radiant. I try the ACCELerator Ultra (£175, harrods.com), by U.S. skin specialist Nurse Jamie. I apply conductor gel to the metal head and move it in a circular motion over my left arm. All I feel is a slight warmth. Apparently, results may be seen within three minutes — but not on me. The company claims any benefits will appear over a few weeks. BGT rating: 4/10 . Veet Natural Inspirations Hair Removal Cream with Shea Butter, £6.99 . PERFECTLY PALE . PROBLEM: The fashion for pale skin means you can’t conceal wispy hairs under a layer of fake tan. ‘Pale, end-of-winter skin means dark hairs on arms stand out more,’ says Dr Patterson. SOLUTION: ‘Hair removal creams will probably be better than waxing,’ says Dr Patterson. ‘It’s hard to hold skin taut and pull off a waxing strip with one hand.’ I invest in Veet Natural Inspirations Hair Removal Cream with Shea Butter, £6.99 ( boots.com) and smooth it on my forearm.After five minutes I remove it with the spatula and wipe the area clean. My skin looks and feels like satin. Invest immediately. BGT RATING: 9/10 . BABY SOFT KNEES . PROBLEM: My knees are so wrinkly they look like walnuts. SOLUTION: ‘Marine algae is good for hydrating, especially super-dry areas such as knees and elbows,’ says Dr Patterson. So I try a Casmara Algae peel-off mask (£9.99, boots.com). This bright red mask comes in a black cylinder with two sachets that you mix in the lid, apply, then peel off. Casmara Algae peel-off mask (£9.99, boots.com ) Veet Sensitive Skin wax strip (£7.29, superdrug.com) When mixed, the powder and clear gel turn into a vibrant poster paint gloop, which I slop on my knees. After 15 minutes, the mask is set hard and I peel it off to reveal baby-soft knees. A great one-off. BGT rating: 7/10 . WAX HAIRY TOES . PROBLEM: ‘Open-toed mules are in fashion, so hairy Hobbit toes must be dealt with,’ says podiatrist Emma Supple. SOLUTION: ‘Wax toes,’ says Supple. ‘Hairs here are thick and you’ll see the ends of the follicles if you shave.’ Prepare feet by soaking in hot water and scrub with a nailbrush, then apply a cream such as Supple London Mineral foot cream (£16, supplefeet.com), which contains lactic acid to melt away dead skin. I cut a strip from a Veet Sensitive Skin wax strip (£7.29, superdrug.com) and apply it along each toe. When I rip it off, my feet look cleaner and well-groomed. BGT rating: 8/10 .

Article text: Avid rugby fan Prince Harry could barely watch as England came up just short of the 26-point margin needed to win their first Six Nations since 2011 in a pulsating match at Twickenham. In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game. Harry - who is a Vice Patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) - also chatted with members of the armed forces at Twickenham . Looking dapper in his navy suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne then took his seat in the stand before singing the national anthem with gusto. Patriotic: Harry chats to a member of the army - he announced this week he will quit the army in the summer . Pointing the way: The Prince is an avid rugby fan - England and Wales host the World Cup later this year . Suave: Harry, in a sharp navy suit, walks along the side of the hallowed Twickenham turf before the match . The Six Nations is the last competitive rugby tournament before England host the World Cup later this year. The tournament begins on September 18 with England taking on Fiji at Twickenham. In 2014 Prince Harry was named as patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, which aims to bring rugby to 750 more schools by the Rugby World Cup in 2019. Looking up: Prince Harry takes his seat in the stands with Bernard Lapasset, left, chairman of the IRB . Role model: Harry chats to students from Reigate School, who had played before England's match vs France . Charismatic: The Prince - patron of the RFU's All Schools campaign, jokes with the girls before a photo shoot . He is also Patron of the RFU Injured Players Foundation. Although one of the most prominent royal rugby fans (he was famously in attendance when England lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Australia in 2003), the Prince is by no means the only one. His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.

Article text: Last January, former Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert slammed the FA Cup as a distraction — claiming that most Premier League managers would prefer to avoid the grand old competition. Phil Parkinson of League One Bradford City would probably be inclined to disagree. On Monday night, the Valley Parade side will kick off their 37th cup tie in the last four seasons when they travel to Reading for an FA Cup quarter-final replay. Phil Parkinson has had terrific success in cup competitions with Bradford City in the last four years . Since taking over in August 2011, Parkinson has led his side to an average extra 10 games each campaign as Bradford have reached the Capital One Cup final and enjoyed lengthy runs in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and FA Cup. These exploits have seen them play 37 cup ties on top of their four 46-game league campaigns during Parkinson's tenure — almost an additional Premier League season's worth of fixtures. Bradford have vanquished no fewer than five top-flight sides — Wigan, Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Sunderland — beaten 14 higher-division teams and won 21, drawn four and lost just 11 ties in total. They also have a 100-per-cent record in penalty shootouts under Parkinson, winning all seven they have contested. Bradford reached the Capital One Cup final in 2013 where they were beaten by Swansea City . And far from sidelining their progress in the league, this rich experience of knockout football helped Bradford win promotion to League One via the play-offs in 2013. Their victory over Northampton at Wembley was their second visit to the national stadium that year after Capital One Cup final defeat to Swansea, and was their 64th game in all competitions. Even if they can't secure a third trip down Wembley Way at the Madjeski Stadium, Bradford are still firmly in the hunt for promotion to the Championship — sitting just three points off sixth place with a game in hand. Perhaps the league and cup can be mutually beneficial after all... The cup pedigree helped Parkinson will promotion with Bradford via the playoffs, reaching League One . 2011-12 (7) - 18th in League Two .

Article text: One mother has learned that the kindness of strangers can be boundless after her seriously ill daughter lost her 'bravery bracelet'. Madelyn McKinnon, from Brisbane, has undergone countless surgeries, procedures and treatments in her two short years, and to help her along the way her family bought her a silver bracelet from Pandora. Each charm on the piece of jewellery represented an obstacle she had overcome, or a milestone she surpassed, and so held special meaning for the McKinnon family and Madelyn's mother Melissa. 'It’s basically Maddy's life on a bracelet, she’s been through a lot in her time,' Melissa McKinnon told Daily Mail Australia. Madelyn McKinnon, who is almost two, lost her 'bravery bracelet' (pictured on her arm) last week at hospital . Maddy's mum Melissa McKinnon was devastated when the special bangle - a representation of her daughter's life, went missing . Thanks to the kindness of strangers who donated money and Pandora who donated an entirely new bracelet Maddy's again has a special bangle . But on Wednesday just after Madelyn, who is two this week, had been admitted to the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane for more treatment, somewhere between the cafeteria and her room the bangle went missing. When a head-to-toe search and retracing of footsteps turned up nothing, Ms McKinnon took to Facebook to ask for help recovering the symbolic bracelet. 'Yes, the bracelet is very pretty and is quite expensive for a 23-month-old but if only you knew what she had to endure for those charms,' the young girl's mother wrote. 'She has been on life support, had countless surgeries, MRI's, Lumbar punctures, EEG's, blood tests, infusions, transfusions to just name a few. Our daughter is a very sick child and has been since she was 5 weeks old and her Pandora bracelet is to recognise her bravery.' Ms McKinnon also said she had checked with hospital security, volunteers and staff and reported the matter to the police but had not managed to recover the bangle. She said the overwhelming feeling when she first realised the bracelet was missing was 'grief'. This replacement bracelet was gifted to Maddy just days ago, and now holds even more meaning for the McKinnon family . Strangers and friends raised over $1100 for young Madelyn in just hours . The young girl, who is almost two, has been sick since she was just weeks old and now the money raised for her bracelet will go towards a new wheelchair . 'It was very emotional for us and we were just absolutely gutted … it's something that means so much and has sentimental value behind it,' Ms McKinnon said. Madelyn has been very ill since she was just weeks old, when she suffered a series of life-threatening infections which left her with brain damage. At the end of August, she was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, which means Ms McKinnon and her partner Marcus are at the hospital monthly, while caring for the six other children in their blended family. Friends and strangers alike were touched by Maddy's story and soon Ms McKinnon was flooded with messages and donations from people wanting to help, through a Facebook page called Brisbane Lost And Found. 'I put a post on that (page) and literally within minutes we had people commenting on there wanting to replace a charm. 'The response we had was just so overwhelming and I was left just speechless,' Ms McKinnon revealed. Friends and strangers alike were touched by Maddy's story this week and soon Ms McKinnon was flooded with messages and donations from people wanting to help . 'The response we had was just so overwhelming and I was left just speechless,' Madelyn's mother Melissa McKinnon revealed . Maddy's ongoing treatment is very expensive and she has six other siblings in her 'blended' family . People offered to replace the charms or bracelet for Madelyn, and soon more than $1000 had been raised. But Ms McKinnon was shocked again when the Pandora store visited by a kind stranger intending to replace the bangle with donations offered to give Madelyn a brand new piece of jewellery and all the charms she lost free of charge. 'There was one lady by the name of Natalie and she ended up coordinating the whole thing for us,' Ms McKinnon said, describing the stranger as a 'beautiful lady'. Before Natalie went to Pandora Mt Ommaney to pick out the new bracelet, another woman in the group had emailed the company's head office directly, explaining Maddy's situation. The store then offered to donate a replacement bracelet, as did two other stores in the area. 'Everybody just pulled in, and then we ended up having three Pandora stores wanting to donate,' Ms McKinnon said. The Brisbane girl has been sick since she was just weeks old, pictured her on life support . 'It just restores your faith in humanity,' Ms McKinnon said . 'We never expected it to end up like this... To have this response makes you so proud to be Australian. 'It just restores your faith in humanity,' she added. The ongoing cost of Madelyn's ongoing treatment is very expensive, and now the McKinnon's have a little extra to help them out after so much was raised for the bracelet. 'The money that was originally raised to go towards charms.. is now being raised to pay for the remaining amount for her wheelchair,' Ms McKinnon said. 'To have the response that we did was just so heartwarming and so generous and kind . 'These are complete strangers, now we feel like she’s sharing her journey,' Ms McKinnon said. 'Now that bracelet has an entire new meaning… she now got a bracelet that shows Australia is with her.' If you would like to donate towards the cost of Madelyn McKinnon's ongoing treatment you can visit her GoFundMe page here, or keep up with her journey on her Facebook page here.

Article text: The mortified female office worker involved in a high-profile sex romp has moved back to her native England because ‘she wants to just cut all ties with everyone' in New Zealand, where the tryst occurred. Both the 50-year-old regional manager and the 26-year-old female office worker are no longer employees at insurance firm in Christchurch, and the woman has returned to the UK. ‘She is a beautiful person but she's been such a silly girl who has made such a silly mistake that has had such massive repercussions for so many people,’ a source told The New Zealand Herald. Scroll down for video . The man and woman involved in the office sex scandal in Christchurch have lost their jobs . The 50-year-old regional manager and the 26-year-old junior employee sex romp took place at the Marsh Ltd insurance firm (pictured) The unwanted publicity that came after video of the couple having sex in the office was posted online has horrified the young woman involved. 'She is not proud at all,' a person close to her also told the Herald. 'She wants to just cut all ties with everyone.' The steamy encounter between the two took place in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action. Video footage and photographs taken by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. Her Facebook page, which was shut down after the scandal hit, has now been reactivated. It says she is from Solihull, in the West Midlands. After the footage became an online sensation, the woman's fiance phoned a local radio station to defend her, but he also claimed that they had split up some six months beforehand. However NZME. News Service revealed that the pair had been 'on a break' at the time and that the engagement had not been officially called off at all. It is understood that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees . Patrons at the Carlton Bar and Eatery (pictured) captured the scandalous behaviour and the footage went viral . It is believed confidentiality agreements prevent all parties from speaking, although it has been reported that this was not the first incident of its kind between the two former employees. The insurance boss involved in the scandal is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter. Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man's wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook. It is still unclear if his wife is standing by him. An employment investigation was instigated following the scandal and all parties are now prohibited from speaking due to a confidentiality agreement . The woman who worked as a secretary with the firm has now returned to her native England . Last month the Daily Mail revealed that a friend of the man's brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved. 'When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,' the friend said. 'After he didn't reply he even asked, 'It's not you is it?' He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.' When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager's house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions. The man was revealed as a husband and father of two. His wife found out about the incident after she saw it on Facebook .

Article text: An unruly wind swirled around Haifa on Friday, whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the Mediterranean flying. It seemed a fittingly uncomfortable Middle Eastern welcome for Wales ahead of what promises to be a match of feverish tenor and great significance. Here in the Holy Land, Wales want to take a step closer to their long-sought grail: qualification for a major tournament. Not since the 1958 World Cup have they been to a finals competition. Wales midfielder Gareth Bale stretches during a training session in Israel on Friday . WALES (probable, 5-3-1-1): Hennessey; Gunter, Collins, Williams, Davies, Taylor; Ramsey, Allen, Ledley; Bale; Vokes. ISRAEL (probable, 4-3-3): Marciano; Dgani, Ben Haim I, Tibi, Ben Harush; Yeini, Natcho, Refaelov; Ben Haim II, Zahavi, Damari. Israel host Chris Coleman’s team in an encounter that could go some way to defining both sides’ aspirations of reaching Euro 2016. It is first against second in Group B. Coleman took his players through their final paces in the freshly-built Sammy Ofer Stadium, which will this evening be filled with around 30,000 fanatical Israel supporters, as well as 900 from Wales. Those travelling fans have not seen their side beaten in this campaign, two wins and two draws, the last point in Belgium a hugely encouraging display and result. Israel have three wins from three, and beat Bosnia 3-0 in their last home game. Bale holds off his team-mates in training as Wales hope to maintain their unbeaten start in Group B . This is an opportunity that needs to be seized by Wales, though. Victory would crystalise the promise shown so far and catapult the finals in France nearer into view. Defeat would undermine that promise to the same extent. Coleman is aware of the importance of this tie, calling it Wales’ biggest since the Euro 2004 play-off against Russia. He hopes to be saying the same when Belgium come to Cardiff in June, but that can only be the case with a positive result here. The Wales manager has twice been involved in campaigns that came close but failed, at either end of his Wales playing career. In 1993 a missed spot-kick against Romania proved decisive, in 2003 it was an inability to score past Russia over two legs. Coleman spoke passionately of these memories as he explained his mentality heading into this crucial game. ‘I was part of a couple of great Welsh sides that never did it,’ he said. ‘I enjoyed the excitement but the disappointment lasts forever. Wales captain Ashley Williams (left) shares a joke with Gareth Bale (right) in training on Friday . ‘We have a good current group, we are going in the right direction but we have been here before. One foot in the door does not get you there. I do not want to play things down, we have earned this pressure and this is what it is all about. But we have to continue to work hard to get to where we want to go.’ His opposition manager Eli Guttman was in jovial mood, making sarcastic remarks about calling Cristiano Ronaldo for advice and insisting Gareth Bale must be worth his £86million fee because Real Madrid paid it. Coleman struck a different chord. ‘I feel focused,’ he said. ‘I am looking forward to it. We have had a real good week of preparation. I am nervous, excited. Any manager who says he is relaxed is telling you a lie. ‘All we can do is focus on performance and the plan. That has been the secret of our success so far.’ Having Bale in your midst must provide a comfort blanket, even amid extreme criticism of his form emanating from Madrid. The 25-year-old loves playing for his country, where he is among long-term friends. No-one belts out the national anthem louder. Wales boss Chris Coleman is adamant his side can cope with a hostile atmosphere in Haifa on Saturday . He has not scored in three internationals, but dragged Wales to victory in Andorra in the opening game of this campaign to set the tone, scoring a retaken free-kick nine minutes from time. Bale is likely to start in a free role behind the striker with a 5-3-2 formation mooted. But Israel will start right back Orel Dgani for the first time and Coleman said he would explore Bale’s position as the match took shape. ‘If there is a weakness to be exploited then of course you look at it,’ he said. ‘We’ve changed tactically during a match before.’ It is not all about Bale. Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams are elite players operating in the Premier League. Williams will win his 50th cap. There is youth, but experience. Coleman acknowledged Israel’s potency in attack, with RB Leipzig’s Omer Damari leading the line looking to add to his five goals in qualification, level with Danny Welbeck. No player has more. Tal Ben Haim, once of Chelsea, Manchester City and Bolton, is the most recognisable name in Israel’s line-up. He wears the armband and is predicting an even louder noise at the Sammy Ofer than the one that stunned Bosnia. ‘I know British football but it will not make it easier for me,’ he said. ‘In the last game all the players spoke about the crowd and we expect against Wales the atmosphere will be even better.’

Article text: St Helens needed a supercharged second half show to maintain their 100 per cent First Utility Super League record with a 30-20 win at Widnes. Both sides were without several key players but Widnes deserved their 14-6 interval lead before the champions ran in 24 second half points. Lance Hohaia crossed for two of the visitors' five tries, with others from the outstanding Atelea Vea, Luke Thompson and Jordan Turner. Travis Burns kicked five goals. Lance Hohaia  scores first try forÂ of St Helens on Friday night . Widnes led at the break thanks to tries from Eamon O'Carroll and Patrick Ah Van in front of 7,772 fans. The hosts were missing skipper Kevin Brown, Cameron Phelps, Lloyd White, Manase Manuokafoa and Hep Cahill with Danny Craven, Stefan Marsh, Grant Gore and Macgraff Leuluai back after last week's defeat at Huddersfield. St Helens, without James Roby and banned Kyle Amor, were strengthened by the return of Burns from suspension, while Paul Wellens reverted to his old full-back spot in the absence of injured Jonny Lomax. Josh Jones and Andre Savelio replaced injured Mark Percival and Mark Flanagan, who were also injured in the win at Wakefield with Luke Walsh still missing. Widnes notched their first home win over Saints for 20 years last season and made a flying start with O'Carroll charging over from short range after Danny Tickle was held short. Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook has the ball stripped from him by the tackle from Stefan Marsh of Widnes . Tickle had no problem with the straightforward conversion to fire his side into a 6-0 lead. Alex Walmsley almost forced his way over for Saints but was bundled into touch by determined tackling. The Vikings defence was not as impressive after 15 minutes with Hohaia scampering over from dummy half, with Burns adding the goal to level at 6-6. Saints continued to pile on the pressure before Widnes were only denied on the break by a try saving tackle from Tommy Makinson on Joe Mellor before a thundering midfield burst by Ah Van. Makinson was forced to quit injured with Widnes regaining the lead with Rhys Hanbury's pass putting Ah Van over in the corner and Marsh booting the touchline conversion with Tickle having gone off. Marsh struck a penalty five minutes before the interval to make it 14-6 and Saints could have no complaints after sloppy handling. Jon Wilkin gives thumbs up to Saints fans at the end of the game . Paddy Flynn failed to collect the restart and Widnes paid the price with Ah Van fumbling a Jon Wilkin kick - Vea pounced and Burns converted to cut the gap to 14-12. The Vikings lost Chris Dean with a rib injury and were forced to drop out twice in quick succession from under their own posts as Saints stepped up the tempo. The pressure told with teenage forward Thompson forcing his way over to give Saints the lead for the first time after 53 minutes with Burns' kick edging them ahead 18-14. Saints put daylight between the sides four minutes later after a thundering burst from Vea with Wellens in support to send Turner over and make it 24-14. Hohaia wriggled over for his second try to add to the Vikings' woes on the hour and stretch the lead to 30-14. Danny Craven looked certain to notch a third try for Widnes after a long range break but stumbled and was stopped by Matt Dawson. Widnes managed a late try from Aaron Heremaia but paid the price for their poor start to the second half. Â .

Article text: An understaffed hospital trust has hired 200 nurses from the Philippines having failed to recruit any from the UK. Gloucestershire Hospitals - which serves 612,000 patients – is also aiming to appoint dozens of nurses from Spain, Portugal and India over the coming months. The trust, comprising the Gloucestershire Royal and Cheltenham General Hospitals, is one of a growing number using overseas nurses to plug severe staffing shortages. Figures show that three quarters of hospitals are recruiting nurses from abroad and nearly 5,700 were hired in the last 12 months. Experts say that as many as one in 20 nursing posts in the NHS is currently vacant which is equivalent to 20,000 nurses. Gloucestershire Hospitals - which serves 612,000 patients – and comprises the Gloucestershire Royal and Cheltenham General Hospitals, has recruited 200 nurses from the Philippines . The shortfall has come about because the number of training places was cut by the Government in 2010 meaning there are fewer ‘home grown’ nurses coming up through the system. In addition, hospitals are now under pressure to hire more nurses than ever before to care for the rising numbers of elderly patients who are very dependent. Nevertheless it is highly unusual for managers to recruit such a large batch of overseas nurses from one country in such a short space of time. The trust has been under severe pressure over the last few months and has been struggling to cope with the high volumes of patients coming into its two A&E units. It was one of about 15 NHS trusts to declare a major incident back in January due to overcrowding and at one ward in Cheltenham hospital, there were just two nurses looking after 30 patients. And so far this year it has missed the A&E target for treating patients in four hours seven out of eight weeks and cancelled 436 non-urgent operations to free-up bed space. The trust said the nurses had been appointed in December following a recruitment fair held in the Philippines, in the Far East, by a private recruitment agency. It said the nurses had all undergone rigorous checks on their skills and ability to speak English. But experts say the increasing reliance on foreign nurses is only a short-term fix as many end up returning to their home countries after a few years. There are also concerns that their English is not good enough to cope on busy wards and that they lack an understanding of how the NHS works. Gloucestershire Hospitals was one of about 15 NHS trusts to declare a major incident back in January due to overcrowding and at one ward in Cheltenham hospital, there were just two nurses looking after 30 patients . Councillor David Drew, Labour Parliamentary candidate for Stroud, Gloucestershire and a member of the Gloucestershire health scrutiny overview committee said: ‘I suppose we can recruit from abroad but that is not sustainable in the long term.’ Dr Frank Harsent, chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, says bringing in the Filipino nurses would relieve the strain on wards. He added: ‘We have also seen an increase in the number of nurses being trained at our hospitals as part of their degree, but there is a three-year time lapse.’ Last month an investigation found that one in six overseas nurses are quitting within two years of arriving in the UK. Freedom of Information requests by Nursing Times also showed that at one hospital, Aintree, in Liverpool, all of the 14 nurses hired from Spain last year have already left. Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said at the time: 'The last couple of years have seen increasingly desperate attempts to plug the gap with more nurses from overseas, who have undoubtedly made a huge contribution and kept the NHS afloat. 'Some of the sums spent on recruiting staff have been ludicrous and the fact that Trusts are not able to keep hold of them is a natural result of years of lackadaisical workforce planning in the NHS.'

Article text: A motorist escaped his exploding car unhurt despite bravely emptying his boot of butane gas canisters to avert an even worse catastrophe. Instead of running for cover, Tomasz Morawski, 34, leapt from his burning vehicle, opened his boot and carried the explosive canisters to safety at the side of the road. With help from a passing motorist, he guaranteed the safety of other drivers who recklessly continued to pass his burning car, and that of firefighters who arrived to extinguish the flames. Spontaneous combustion: Tomasz Morawski, 34, leaps from his car after its engine burst into flames when he stopped at a red light on his way to work in the city of Gliwice, southern Poland . Bravery: As other motorists try to get their vehicles out of the way, Mr Morawski and another motorist empty his boot of butane and propane gas canisters to avert a possibly disastrous explosion . Busy: The video was shot from a CCTV camera during the morning rush hour in Gliwice . 'I'm just glad I was able to get the gas canisters out in time otherwise this could have been a lot, lot worse,' Mr Morawski said. CCTV footage shows Mr Morawski's vehicle quickly engulfed in flames after he stopped at a red light on the way to work in Gliwice, southern Poland. As the fire quickly spreads, he jumps out of the driver side door, pops open the boot and begins emptying it of propane and butane gas canisters. Fellow motorist Michal Bukowski, 29, was quoted by Central European News as saying: 'I was going in the opposite direction and was waiting for the lights to change when I saw the car suddenly go up in flames with a massive whoosh. 'It was like it had been hit with a rocket. 'The driver got out and I saw him running back and forth across the road taking canisters to the pavement. 'I quickly dialled the fire brigade and then pulled over to help.' As black billowing smoke filled the sky the two men unloaded the car as a fire engine pulled up. Vehicles continued to drive past the fire until emergency services were able to block the road. Emergency response: Firefighters douse the burning car as a vehicle arrives to block the road . Dangerous: Vehicles had continued to drive past until that point, even though the car could have exploded . Safety: Steam mixes with smoke to finally obscure the view of the CCTV camera over the junction as the fire is extinguished. Gliwice's fire brigade said it would examine the car to work out why it exploded . A spokesman for Gliwice's fire brigade said: 'We sealed off the road as at that point traffic was still going by and we had no idea if or when the engine would exploded. 'We then doused it with water ensuring the flames are well and truly out. 'We are now examine the car to try and identify the cause of the explosion.' A major industrial and scientific hub, Gliwice is part of a wider metropolis of 2.7million in southern Poland called the Katowice urban area.

Article text: The burden of green taxes on businesses has doubled under the Coalition, according to official figures. The Treasury imposed £2.5billion of levies in 2010-11 – but the takings are predicted to reach £4.6billion in 2015-16, it emerged yesterday. Business groups have warned the taxes could lead to job losses. There are also fears that more of the costs will be passed on to customers. A written statement from Treasury minister Priti Patel stated that the Government is 'committed to increasing the proportion of tax revenue accounted for by environmental taxes' to 'encourage positive behaviour change' and make firms cut carbon emissions. The burden of green taxes on businesses has doubled under the Coalition. Pictured is the Treasury building in London . Environment campaigners say such taxes on firms' energy use set an example to other countries and will help tackle climate change – but critics point out that many of them are specific to the UK, which could encourage businesses that use a lot of energy to move abroad. One cost that has risen substantially over the past five years is the Climate Change Levy, a charge on every kilowatt hour of electricity and gas firms use to generate energy. Two years ago, another tax – the Carbon Price Floor – was introduced on every ton of carbon that firms emit. These two levies now cost businesses a combined £2billion. Larger firms have also been hit by the Energy Efficiency Scheme to further reduce carbon emissions. The charge, introduced in 2010, will bring in £800million this year. Another three green taxes – on landfill and mining, and a European levy on carbon – have remained steady since 2010, costing firms £1.8billion a year. Gareth Stace, of the manufacturers' group EEF, said: 'These figures prove the point that we have been making for some time, namely that UK industry – especially energy-intensive companies – are paying a very heavy price. 'We urgently need to see competitiveness at the heart of energy and climate change policy to place us on a level playing field with even our European competitors who are not facing these bills, let alone the rest of the world. Failure to do this by the next government, if it continues to use carbon taxes as a revenue-raising tool, could only result in lost jobs and investment.' A Treasury spokesman said: 'This Government is committed to creating a tax system that is simple, fair and creates the right conditions... we have backed businesses with lower taxes overall, cutting corporation tax, giving employers up to £2,000 off their National Insurance bill and giving small high street businesses £1,000 off their business rates.'

Article text: The US Presbyterian Church  has voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples after a decades long debate. The church, which accounts for just under two million members and represents the largest Presbyterian denomination, made the announcement after the majority of its 171 regional governing bodies approved the change. Its revised constitution will now read that marriage is 'a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman,' as opposed to just a man and woman previously. Scroll down for video . The Presbyterian Church USA which accounts for just under two million members, voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples ©Alex Wong (Getty Images/AFP/File) 'Finally, the church in its constitutional documents fully recognizes that the love of gays and lesbian couples is worth celebrating in the faith community,' Rev. Brian D. Ellison, executive director of the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, which advocates gay inclusion in the church, told the New York Times. 'There is still disagreement, and I don’t mean to minimize that, but I think we are learning that we can disagree and still be church together.' The new language, which was approved by the church's General Assembly last year, had  to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies. A grouping of congregations in the state of New Jersey became the 86th body to do just that Tuesday. The decision is likely to drive a further wedge between Presbyterian USA members, who have taken opposite sides on the issue. The church has in fact been losing some of its members as it adopts a more liberal stance on social and religious issues. That being said, the fact that some many members who were against same-sex marriage have moved on to other churches made the passage of this new definition far easier for the church. At last year's Presbyterian General Assembly, the church also gave its pastors a green light to marry gay and lesbian couples in states where such marriages are allowed. 'These decisions have been welcomed by some and are a disappointment to others,' Gradye Parsons, stated clerk of the General Assembly, said at the time. The Presbyterians' position stands in sharp contrast to that of the Roman Catholic church, the biggest single denomination among Americans, and fundamentalist Evangelicals who strongly oppose gay marriage. In 2011, the Presbyterian Church USA voted to approve the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy. The constitution's new wording will take effect on June 21.
----------------------------------------

Its constitution will read that marriage is 'a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman,' not  a man and woman .
The new language, which was approved by the church's General Assembly last year, had to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies .
Many have left the fair of recent as it takes a more liberal stance on religious and social issues .
The church still counts close to 2million members .
----------------------------------------
Generated Summary: The church, which accounts for just under two million members, voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples. Its revised constitution will now read that marriage is 'a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman,' as opposed to just a man and woman previously.

Article text: A $300,000 McLaren sports car was wrecked after a man's tractor trailer stalled and was plowed into by a train as it sat on the tracks. The driver of the truck heard a train coming and made out before his vehicle was hit. No one was injured in the Orange Park, Florida, crash on Friday. A McLaren MP4-12C, however, was heavily damaged. Ryan Fung was taking Jorg Bober's McLaren to a dealership near Orange Park, Florida, for warranty work when we got stuck on the railroad tracks . Though Fung escaped his truck when he heard the train coming, he couldn't save the car which was in a trailer in tow . Bober received a call from Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, a McLaren dealership, who said his car had been totaled . Truck driver Ryan Fung frantically called 911 when we got stuck at the crossing. 'Yeah I'm stuck right across. The bars are coming down, and he's about to hit the truck,' he told the dispatcher. The dispatcher told Fung to get out of the truck as a train horn sounded in the background. Fung escaped the crash with about three minutes to spare but he was unable to save the car in tow, according to First Coast News. The car's owner, Dr Jorg Bober told Palm Beach Post that his car had been picked up by the company for warranty work when it got stuck on the tracks. 'My nurse called me up, she says "Listen, take doctors Lake Drive the opposite way to college because there's a huge train accident". I didn't think anything of it. Five minutes later I get a call from the company saying, "Your car is totaled". I was like "Really? That's my car?" the pediatrician said. Bober only found out about the accident from a nurse who told him to take an alternative route to work to miss the traffic . Bober's hoping that Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater will cover losses since it was being taken to their dealership . When asked about the accident Bober was in good spirts, saying he'd 'get another one' once the accident was sorted out . But Bober's resolution to the issue of having a totaled exotic car was simple. 'Eh, we'll get another one,' he told Palm Beach Post. Bober hopes Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, the McLaren dealership where he bought the car, will cover the loss, according to WFLA. 'They've apologized, ya know. And as far as I'm concerned, that's what they can do right now. I mean, I'm actually pretty happy that no one got hurt,' he told WFLA. The area where the accident occurred has signs that read 'No Thru Trucks', meaning the truck driver should not have driven across the tracks. Florida Highway Patrol said the driver will be cited. Clay County Sheriff's Office, Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Transportation were at the scene on Friday. Four trains transporting vehicles from Orlando to Louisville and two passenger Amtrak trains were affected or delayed from the crash. The area where the driver crossed the tracks has a large sign reading, 'No Thru Trucks'. Fung will be cited for driving through the area, Florida Highway Patrol said .
