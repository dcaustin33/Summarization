Article text: (CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied. That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. "I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big," Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. "Thanks for all the support and prayers," a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. "I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger." CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page. But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. So high, that it is taking five surgeons, a covey of physician assistants, nurses and anesthesiologists, and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people. They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients. "The ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs, one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair," the medical center said in a statement. The chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up Friday. In late March, the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients. Here's how the super swap works, according to California Pacific Medical Center. Say, your brother needs a kidney to save his life, or at least get off of dialysis, and you're willing to give him one of yours. But then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him, and it's certain his body would reject it. Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died. Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him. Alternatively, you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say, two more siblings, where the donor's kidney isn't suited for his sister, the recipient. But maybe your kidney is a match for his sister, and his kidney is a match for your brother. So, you'd do a swap. That's called a paired donation. It's a bit of a surgical square dance, where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling. But instead of a square dance, Broussard's generous move set off a chain reaction, like dominoes falling. Her kidney, which was removed Thursday, went to a recipient, who was paired with a donor. That donor's kidney went to the next recipient, who was also paired with a donor, and so on. On Friday, the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain. Such long-chain transplanting is rare. It's been done before, California Pacific Medical Center said in a statement, but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time. That changed when a computer programmer named David Jacobs received a kidney transplant. He had been waiting on a deceased donor list, when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger. Jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills, creating MatchGrid, a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly. "When we did a five-way swap a few years ago, which was one of the largest, it took about three to four months. We did this in about three weeks," Jacobs said. But this chain wouldn't have worked so quickly without Broussard's generosity -- or may not have worked at all. "The significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients," said Dr. Steven Katznelson. "Where there had been only three or four options, with the inclusion of the altruistic donor, we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients." And that's divine, Broussard's friend Shirley Williams wrote in a comment her on Broussard's Facebook page. "You are a true angel my friend."

Article text: (CNN)On the 6th of April 1996, San Jose Clash and DC United strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California. The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer. Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous "birth of a new era for American soccer." Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia. Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half. Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper. As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period. Long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start. Attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015. A further four are set to be added by 2020. On top of this, the new season is the first of a new domestic TV and media rights deal with FOX, ESPN and Univision worth $700 million over eight years. This figure may pale beside the $5.1 billion recently paid by UK broadcasters for the English Premier League, the richest football league in the world, but it represents a tripling in value of the previous MLS deal. According to Phil Rawlins, co-primary owner and president of the new MLS franchise, Orlando City Soccer Club, "the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically" in the U.S.. He believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the MLS. Rawlins' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation. He describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago. This weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness Orlando City's opening weekend fixture against New York City, another new club making their MLS bow. World Cup winners Kaka and David Villa will turn out for Orlando and New York City respectively. "We're just on the crest of the wave at the moment," Rawlins said of football's American progress. "Can it be the number two, number three sport in this country? Yes, I think it can. And it can be in a short space of time." These positive assertions are backed by the huge interest U.S. fans showed in last year's World Cup in Brazil. Team USA's group stage clash with Portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from TV ratings firm, Nielsen. That's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 World Series averaged on FOX or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 NBA finals on ABC. Anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out Chicago's Grant Park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the U.S. now being anything other than a big deal. Reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. The MLS was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. Three teams -- Miami Fusion, Tampa Bay Mutiny (both in 2001) and Chivas USA (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. A report by Forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 MLS teams were profitable. And as recently as this week, MLS players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. Then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. A salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. Each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to "off budget" signings which are not included within the cap. This includes promising Generation Adidas players who enter the MLS through the draft systems before completing their college education. Homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (DPs), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. One of the main criticisms of the MLS and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like David Beckham, Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry to appear in the MLS, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. Why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? And herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. Although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means MLS teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. Head coach of Sporting Kansas, Peter Vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the Kansas City Star newspaper last year. "We're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. We have a salary cap. They don't," Vermes said. According to Paulo Teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the MLS grow yet further. He describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with European passports. Such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the MLS to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the Atlantic. Theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the MLS. This in turn will raise the standard further. An early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of Oriol Rossell, a Spanish midfielder who moved from Sporting Kansas to Sporting Lisbon last year in a deal brokered by Teixeira. Rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by FC Barcelona in 2012. He excelled at Kansas, winning the MLS Cup before being sold to the Portuguese giants at a profit in June 2014. Teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. It could also be achieved by signing DPs closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. This last point is something that appears be happening already. "Before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in Europe," Teixeira said. "(But) Villa is not an old guy, (Frank) Lampard is still going strong" and both could still offer something to teams in Europe, he said by way of example of New York City's first DP signings. Nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  "is probably something we'll see more of." Whether Teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. Either way, that brave new MLS dawn that broke over San Jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning. CNN's Don Riddell contributed to this story.

Article text: (CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now "feeling well" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was "fine," with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. "I wanted to reassure you concerning my health," Gomis told the website. "It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. "I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. "I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages." Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: "We can't not be worried, it scares you each time." Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. "He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems," Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. "It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. "It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks." Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January. Almost exactly three years ago at White Hart Lane, then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was near death,  according to Bolton, but survived after being treated at the London Chest Hospital. He subsequently retired. Other footballers, including Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe in 2003 and Spanish international Antonio Puerta in 2007, didn't survive after collapsing on the pitch.

Article text: (CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Happy Gilmore than the world's reigning No 1. player. But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character. Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. "(It) felt good at the time," a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. "I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had of been any other club I probably wouldn't have but I didn't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not." The club "must have went a good 60, 70 yards," he joked. McIlroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader JB Holmes. While an improvement on last weeks performance at the Honda Classic event, where he failed to make the cut, the Northern Irishman's frustration with elements of his game was still clear. "I think every golfer feels it because I don't hit shots like the one I hit on 8 on the range," he said. "That's what really bothers me, the fact that I get out on the course and I hit shots that I'm not seeing when I'm in a more relaxed environment. "So it's a little bit of mental, a little bit of physical. It's just everything is not quite matching up." Elsewhere on the course, Ryan Holmes scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall, two shots behind Holmes. Former world No 1., Adam Scott carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six-under while Bubba Watson and Henrik Stenson are tied for fourth on four-under.

Article text: (CNN)A Pennsylvania community is pulling together to search for an eighth-grade student who has been missing since Wednesday. The search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online. The parents of Cayman Naib, 13, have been communicating through the Facebook group "Find Cayman" since a day after his disappearance, according to close friend David Binswanger. Newtown Police say Cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants and hiking boots. He could be in the Radnor-Wayne area, roughly 20 miles from Philadelphia, or may have purchased a train ticket to Philadelphia, according to an alert posted on Facebook. "We think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act," Farid Naib, Cayman's father, wrote Thursday on the group page. "We have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is. Cayman does have his phone, we don't know if he has any cash, he does not have his wallet." The parents said that his phone was out of power at the time. "Cayman left within 30 minutes after he received an email from school regarding overdue home work (we do not blame the school) and most probably did not do any pre planning ... He is a good kid, and has no substance abuse or other issues, this is the first time he has ever done anything like this," his father and mother, Becky Naib, posted Friday. The parents wrote Saturday that Cayman was not wearing waterproof clothing and that he did not take his backpack. Binswanger said weather limited search efforts Wednesday, the night Cayman went missing. Wednesday it was rainy and Thursday there was 6-8 inches of snow. Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up to pass out fliers and to canvass areas, according to posts. A post late Saturday explained search efforts included "advanced, geo-spacial tracking software to determine the exact locations where searchers went," and added that the search would be taken to the skies Sunday with deployment of the Civil Air Patrol. In many posts, the families appealed directly to their son. "Cayman, if you read this please know that you are forgiven for everything, and I mean everything, you have the ultimate free pass. Just come home, we are so worried about you" the family posted Saturday. A message to families from the head of The Shipley School, which Cayman attends, read in part: "Cayman's sister Savannah is in ninth grade at Shipley and his parents, Farid and Becky, are terrific people. They have contacted police and are aware that we are sending you this email. We hope that Cayman is ok and are saying our prayers." CNN could not immediately get in touch with police or the FBI.

Article text: (CNN)My vote for Father of the Year goes to Curt Schilling. The former Major League Baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of Twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about Schilling's teenage daughter. The drama started, innocently enough, on February 25, when Schilling played the role of a proud father. He sent a tweet congratulating his daughter, Gabby, on being accepted to Salve Regina University, where she'll play softball. It read: "Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!! — Curt Schilling (@gehrig38)" Almost immediately, responses came in from young men, complete strangers who apparently followed Schilling on Twitter. The tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant. Threats of rape were common. The tweets were deleted, and the accounts were closed after this story went viral. But not before Schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog. What was said about 17-year-old Gabby Schilling wasn't just obnoxious. It was vile and obscene. What was said wasn't just mean and ugly. It was threatening and scary. As a parent, it's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions. These misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity, the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites, where you feel free to be a  despicable human being because, you think, no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words. If so, they thought wrong. They couldn't hide. They were found out, and they got the throttling they so richly deserved. Thanks to dad. According to Schilling, who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are, two people have already paid a price due to their tweets. One was a student disc jockey at a community college in New Jersey, who was suspended, and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the New York Yankees, who was fired. Concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide, Schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved. Bravo for him. I'm sure that, all across America, dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at Schilling's self-control. I have two daughters of my own, and he's a better man than me. If ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap, this is it. So what additional insights can we draw, and what larger lessons can we learn, from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media? There are a few. The first is about accountability, the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid. But Schilling wouldn't let them. At their best, social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community. At their worst, they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences. We need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability. There's also something to be said about protective parents, and how essential they are to a working society. We should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews. We shouldn't bubblewrap our kids, and keep them from playing outdoors, and then sit around wondering why they're soft, timid, and risk-averse. But protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style. A parent's top job is to protect his children. Schilling did his job. Finally, it's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules, standards, and expectations that should guide your behavior. There are things you don't say. There are boundaries, ways that we expect you to behave so you don't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself, your friends, and your family. If you don't have social skills, you don't belong on social media. The tweets make you wince. But in this story, you'll still find plenty to smile about. This whole drama unfolded because Schilling was proud of his daughter. Now, given how he reacted, we all have reason to be proud of him. ​ .

Article text: (CNN)Another one for the "tourists behaving badly" file. Two American women have reportedly been arrested for carving their initials into a wall with a coin inside Rome's Colosseum. Daily Italian newspaper La Stampa says the women, aged 21 and 25, were spotted carrying out the act by fellow tourists, who then told security. The two letters -- J and N -- were about eight inches in length and scratched on a brick wall at the historic Roman amphitheater. The women, both from California, reportedly snapped a selfie of themselves with their initials before they were arrested. Their names have not been released. The American pair may now face a fine for "aggravated damage" on a building of historical and artistic interest. If one Russian's experience is anything to go by, the price won't be cheap. Last November, authorities in Rome slapped a 20,000-euro ($21,685) penalty on a Russian tourist caught carving his name into the famed landmark. The 42-year-old man was apprehended after a guard at the Colosseum saw him carve the letter "K" in a section of brickwork. After police caught up with him, the man was found guilty of causing aggravated damage, fined and given a four-month suspended sentence. The Russian was one of five tourists caught carving graffiti on Colosseum walls in 2014. The earlier incidents involved two Australians -- a father and son -- and a Canadian and a Brazilian, both teenagers. Rome isn't alone in having to deal with inappropriate tourist behavior this month. Egypt is now looking into reports that one of its most historic sites was the backdrop for a Russian porn flick. According to Al Arabiya News, authorities have confirmed that an X-rated film was shot next to the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx and are now investigating. The video was reportedly made by Russian tourists, who then uploaded it to the Internet nine months ago. Al Arabiya reports that Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh al-Demati says the issue has been referred to the public prosecutor and new surveillance cameras are being installed in the area. The incident comes as a reminder that no world landmark is safe from the salacious urges of tourists -- no matter how sacred it might be to the locals. Cambodia's Angkor Archeological Park experienced its own string of nudity-related incidents this year. In February, U.S. tourists and sisters Lindsey Kate Adams and Leslie Jan Adams were deported after allegedly getting caught taking partially nude photos at Preah Khan temple, one of the sacred sites inside Cambodia's Angkor complex. They received six-month suspended prison sentences, a one-million riel ($250) fine and were banned from entering the country for four years. In January, a group of photos featuring a topless dancer leaning against the ruins surfaced on Facebook. Early last year, Peru officials were forced to respond to a chain of "naked tourism" incidents at Machu Picchu, also a World Heritage Site. They detained four American tourists, two Canadians and two Australians for stripping down for pictures at the site. CNN's Barry Neild contributed to this report.

Article text: (CNN)A shooting at a bar popular with expatriates in Mali on Saturday killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. One French citizen, one Belgian and three Malians were killed in the attack in the capital of Bamako, said Gabriel Toure, director of a local hospital. An additional eight people were wounded, he said. Authorities called the shooting a "criminal and terrorist act." "Mali remains committed to seeking peace and will not be intimidated by those who have no other motives than to do away (with) the prospects of peace and harmony amongst the Malians," the government said in a statement. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. The purported claim came in an audio message in which the group said it carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing of one of its leaders, Al Akhbar said. "Al-Murabitun may be considered a regional competitor to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)," according to the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm. The U.S. State Department said in January that al-Murabitun is a "newly-formed" militant group that has presence in northern Mali. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the victim from his country was 31 years old. French President Francois Hollande released a statement condemning the attack. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his condolences to the victims' families in a news conference in Paris on Saturday. "This is an act of cowardice," he said. "But an act of opening fire in a restaurant filled with innocent civilians -- in the end, that only strengthens our resolve to fight terrorism in all of its forms, wherever it exists." The French Embassy in Bamako warned its citizens to be on alert if they go out in public. Though it's unclear whether any rebel group is responsible for the attack, Malian forces have battled Islamist militants in the northern part of the nation for years. Fabius said the Malian government was interrogating some suspects. Mali plunged into chaos after soldiers staged a coup three years ago. As a result, Tuareg fighters capitalized on the power vacuum to launch an insurgency that ended with their takeover of the north. After the Tuareg fighters seized the region, a power struggle erupted with local Islamist radicals. The extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Since then, the nation has battled various rebel factions, mostly in the northern region, with the help of French and African forces. CNN's Brian Walker, Joshua Berlinger and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.

Article text: (CNN)Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly spitting during an altercation in Wednesday night's Premier League game at St James' Park. In a statement, English football's governing body said the players had been charged "in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E1[a] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other. "The incidents were not seen by the match officials but [were] caught on video." The players have until 6pm GMT on Friday to respond to the charge, and could face six-game bans if found guilty. Both Evans and Cisse released statements the day after the incident, with Evans saying: "I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse." Cisse's statement said: "I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down." Spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers, and former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, now a TV pundit, told the BBC's Match of the Day programme the incident had been "disgusting." "This is not acceptable," he said. "There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis." Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said he did not believe Evans had deliberately spat at Cisse, telling BT Sport: "Look, it's not very nice. I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. "I know Jonny -- he's not that type of person. If he wants to do that then it's not hard to miss, is it? He's only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable." And former Liverpool player Steve McManaman told the channel: "Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans' neck from about six inches. It's absolutely disgusting. "Two wrongs do not make a right. If Jonny Evans has spat at him then it's wrong, but for Papiss Cisse to get up and react like that is absolutely disgusting. We talk about bad tackles, but that is worse."

Article text: (CNN)Nine foreign workers are believed to be in the hands of ISIS-affiliated militants after an attack on a Libyan oil field, according to officials. Libya's internationally recognized government has blamed "ISIS militias" for the attack Friday in which the Al-Ghani oil field was set on fire. The kidnapped foreigners were working for VAOS, an Austrian-owned oil services company whose headquarters are in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. They include four Filipinos, an Austrian, a Czech and a Ghanaian, according to the Philippine foreign ministry. The Bangladeshi government said one of its citizens was also taken hostage. The nationality of the ninth worker was unclear. The abductions come amid Libya's deteriorating security situation in which Islamic militias, some of them pledging allegiance to the extremist group ISIS, have thrived. Egypt carried out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya last month after the killings of Egyptian Christians who had been kidnapped while working in a Libyan city. The Philippine foreign ministry said Monday that its Tripoli embassy had "stepped up coordination" with the Austrian company and Libyan authorities "to locate the abducted Filipinos and ensure their safe and immediate release." Martin Weiss, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry tweeted Monday that "credible sources" had confirmed that the Austrian citizen and other international workers were in the hands of ISIS "terrorists." The attack on Al-Ghani is the latest in a recent spate of violence by militants targeting oil fields in Libya. The Libyan National Oil Corporation said over the weekend that it had warned VAOS more than two weeks ago to leave the area because of security concerns. VAOS wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. The Philippine foreign ministry said 52 other Filipinos are employed by VAOS but were relocated out of Al-Ghani "much earlier" and are now in Tripoli. Three other Filipinos have been missing in Libya since they were seized at the Mabruk oil field in February, the foreign ministry said. "These cases underscore the escalating threat to the safety and security of Filipino oil workers in Libyan oil fields which have been targeted by armed groups in recent weeks," said foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose. He said Philippine authorities were unsure at this point whether the kidnappers were ISIS members. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Marilia Brocchetto, and journalists Ayman Kekly and Arlene Samson-Espiritu, contributed to this report.

Article text: (CNN)Think back to your high school's senior prank. Maybe you and your pals slipped a pig into the building or greased all the door handles or turned all the chairs upside-down. So it's no surprise that Wichita high school Principal Sherman Padgett was reluctant to play along last week when a student showed up and told him to stand in the hallway holding a bucket. "She didn't say anything about why. She just said 'hold the bucket,' " the North High School principal told CNN affiliate KWCH. "I'm not going to hold the bucket unless I have a little inkling of why it could be." Good thing he changed his mind. Once he did, student after student streamed by, dropping notes of praise and thanks into the bucket. "Thank you for making high school the best years of my life," one said. "You've made my first year experience in America one that I will always fondly remember," read another. One student recalled how Padgett "helped me get through my eating disorder and helped me get into therapy." The notes were the idea of senior Emily Jones. She decided she wanted to do something nice for the principal and cooked up the plan with her mother. "Padgett's an awesome principal," she said. For Padgett, who has been principal at North since 2006, the experience was priceless. "Became a little emotional on some of them," he said, "I kind of read them and thought, 'man, this is better than a paycheck. This is why I do the things that I do.' "

Norman Lee, an artist for DC and Marvel comics, went missing while snorkeling with his wife off the eastern coast of Grand Cayman, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Strong currents hindered the search, which lasted until Friday evening, Cayman 27 reported. "It is unlikely that we will make any recovery at this stage," Chief Inspector Brad Ebanks told Cayman 27. Lee, 47, of Weymouth, Massachusetts, was known and for his work on "Wolverine Annual," "Supergirl," "Starman" and other comic book titles. Tributes flooded his Facebook page and Twitter from friends, fans and colleagues who knew him from art school and comic conventions. "I cannot express how shaken I am that I will never get the chance to see that smile again, and it saddens me that this world has lost a wonderful man in Norman Lee. To his wife Jan, and his family and all his friends and fans that loved him, my sincerest condolences," friend and fellow graphic artist Chris Kinniery said on Facebook.

Article text: (CNN)Jessie Usher, the lead of Starz's series "Survivor's Remorse," has been cast in Fox's sequel "Independence Day 2." Liam Hemsworth has also been cast in a lead role and Jeff Goldblum will reprise his role as David Levinson from the original. It has been nearly 20 years since the Will Smith-starring sci-fi film hit theaters, grossing more than $800 million worldwide at the box office. Director Roland Emmerich will return to helm the film. "Independence Day 2" is set for release on June 24, 2016 — almost exactly 20 years from when the first film hit theaters on July 3, 1996. Dean Devlin, Emmerich and Harald Kloser are producing. Independence Day 2 is a big get for Usher, who will play a central character in the new film as the son of Smith's character. Smith's role in the first blockbuster helped establish him as a star, kicking his career up to the next level. Usher stars in the Lebron James-produced Starz TV series "Survivor's Remorse" as Cam Calloway, a basketball player who moves with his family to Atlanta after he signs a pro contract. The first season premiered Oct. 4, 2014, and Starz quickly renewed the show for a second season, which will air later this year. The rising star's film credits includes TriStar football drama When the Game Stands Tall, which hit theaters in August. On the TV side, he previously starred in the Cartoon Network's series Level Up. He's repped by Paradigm and Williams Unlimited. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.

Article text: (CNN)Former Vice President Walter Mondale was released from the Mayo Clinic on Saturday after being admitted with influenza, hospital spokeswoman Kelley Luckstein said. "He's doing well. We treated him for flu and cold symptoms and he was released today," she said. Mondale, 87, was diagnosed after he went to the hospital for a routine checkup following a fever, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday. "He is in the bed right this moment, but looking forward to come back home," Carter said during a speech at a Nobel Peace Prize Forum in Minneapolis. "He said tell everybody he is doing well." Mondale underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The 42nd vice president served under Carter between 1977 and 1981, and later ran for President, but lost to Ronald Reagan. But not before he made history by naming a woman, U.S. Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro of New York, as his running mate. Before that, the former lawyer was  a U.S. senator from Minnesota. His wife, Joan Mondale, died last year.

Article text: (CNN)The only thing crazier than a guy in snowbound Massachusetts boxing up the powdery white stuff and offering it for sale online? People are actually buying it. For $89, self-styled entrepreneur Kyle Waring will ship you 6 pounds of Boston-area snow in an insulated Styrofoam box -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs, he says. But not if you live in New England or surrounding states. "We will not ship snow to any states in the northeast!" says Waring's website, ShipSnowYo.com. "We're in the business of expunging snow!" His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on Tuesday alone, his busiest day yet. With more than 45 total inches, Boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history. Most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance, but Waring saw an opportunity. According to Boston.com, it all started a few weeks ago, when Waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a coastal suburb north of Boston. He joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states, and an idea was born. His business slogan: "Our nightmare is your dream!" At first, ShipSnowYo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $19.99, but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination. So this week, Waring began shipping larger amounts in the Styrofoam cubes, which he promises will arrive anywhere in the U.S. in less than 20 hours. He also has begun selling a 10-pound box of snow for $119. Many of his customers appear to be companies in warm-weather states who are buying the snow as a gag, he said. Whether Waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen. But he has no shortage of product. "At this rate, it's going to be July until the snow melts," he told Boston.com. "But I've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items. Maybe I'll ship some fall foliage."

Article text: (CNN)Farah fled the civil war in Syria with her husband in the middle of the night, hitching rides on trucks until they finally crossed into Jordan. Two days later, she gave birth to a girl in a country where they hold no status. Like 70,000 other refugees from Syria, Iraq, Sudan and the Palestinian Territories, Farah (her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity) now lives with her family in Zarqa, a poor Jordanian city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks. Men dominate public spaces, and many women stay at home, isolated. Two years ago, Farah was a nurse and her husband a lawyer. Here, he found work tiling construction sites, but was arrested three times for working illegally. "Now my husband stays at home, depressed and afraid of being sent to the camps," Farah said. She is now the family breadwinner, working at a local organization providing educational programs to Syrian and Jordanian children. Every day she navigates the dangers of Zarqa's crime-ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men. Yet Zarqa is also a pocket of hope. Some 384 female refugees working with the Near East Foundation  have been able to re-establish savings, restore dignity, strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives. Many of them choose to become earners for the first time. They belong to a network of Jordanian and refugee women -- coaches, mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support, exchange tips and build friendships. Some 80% of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home-based business. Fatiya, who escaped Iraq during the 2003 invasion, was surviving on charity until six months ago. Now she runs her own leather goods home-based business, making belts, wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home. These days, Fatiya is busy rebuilding her life. "I make my own way,"she says. Zainab, also an Iraqi refugee, is now a hairdresser in Zarqa. On the side, she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women, walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent. On March 8, we celebrate International Women's Day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who, like Farah, Fatiya and Zainab, continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination, creativity and skill, despite increasingly limited options. Aid agencies must match the strength of these women's resilience. To truly assist them, we must empower them with opportunities and choices. Of the 10.5 million refugees registered with UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, less than 1% are eventually resettled. The rest remain in limbo, forced to forge new lives in places where they often have no right to work. Refugees are displaced for an average of 20 years, and more than half disappear into urban sprawls where they struggle to integrate and start their lives over. Humanitarian assistance and media attention tend to fixate on "immediate" aid -- distribution of cash, food and subsistence items. This is unsustainable. UNHCR provides critical cash assistance to refugees in Jordan -- but this can be as little as $71 a month, 16 times below the country's poverty line. Refugees need to supplement their allowances, yet they cannot legally find employment, and working in the informal sector can be dangerous. Farah, Fatiya and Zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy. But their increased role as earners challenges cultural norms, exposing them to heightened abuse and violence. Women's ability to generate income does not guarantee economic independence. To help this network of women control the income they earn, the Near East Foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives' and daughters' newfound roles. "In the beginning, these women were tremendously shy -- they didn't talk," says Hamdan Eliemat, who heads the Bani Hasan Islamic Society, a community organization supporting the women. He laughs. "And now they won't stop talking. And we men, now we have to listen." The international community must advocate for refugees' right to survive. We must ensure that beyond immediate aid, women have access to skill-building, financial resources, social networks and protection from violence and harassment, so they have the chance to build their own futures.

Article text: (CNN)Real Madrid fell to a lacklustre 1-0 defeat at the hands of Athletic Bilbao Saturday, potentially handing the La Liga advantage to arch rival Barcelona. A stunning header from Aritz Aduriz shortly before half time was enough to win the day for an organized and impressive Bilbao. Real piled on the pressure for much of the second half but couldn't find a way past a staunch opponent despite finishing the match with four strikers on the park. Gareth Bale struck a post with an extraordinary shot from close to the halfway line as full time approached while Arduriz almost doubled Bilbao's lead with another headed chance late on. The result means second placed Barca can now take top spot should it win at home to mid-table Rayo Vallecano Sunday. Of more immediate concern to Real boss Carlo Ancelotti after the game, however, was his side's lack of cutting edge. "I think the problem we are having at the moment is quite clear," Ancelotti told reporters. "We are not finding a way through like we did in the games before. We've only scored one goal, from a penalty, in two games. "That is the problem we have to fix. We lack efficiency up front." Real are now without a win in two league games while the 4-0 February hammering at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid, the clubs biggest derby defeat since 1947, is still fresh in the memory. With the second El Classico fixture of the season against Barcelona only a fortnight away, Ancelotti is looking for a quick fix to his side's attacking inhibitions. However, such worries are of little concern to a Bilbao side celebrating its first win over Real in five years. After a slow start to the season the Basques are now up to eighth position. "We are very proud of how hard we worked," goalscorer Arduriz said in comments carried by the AFP news agency. "The three points will prove a huge boost." "The fans have enjoyed it a lot and they deserved that after the poor performances at San Mames earlier in the season." Bayern Munich continued its seemingly inexorable march to a third consecutive Bundesliga title with a come from behind 3-1 victory away to Hannover. Hiroshi Kiyotake gave the hosts a surprise lead after 25 minutes but Xabi Alonso levelled shortly after. A second half brace from Thomas Muller ensured the Bavarians would increase their league at the top of the Bundesliga to 11 points as second place Wolfsburg fell to a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Elsewhere Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's winning streak came to an end with as Jurgen Klopp's revitalized side were held to a 0-0 draw with Hamburg. Paris Saint Germain returned to the top of the Ligue 1 table, for 24 hours at least, with a convincing 4-1 win over Lens at the Parc de Princes. David Luiz opened the scoring as the first half came to a close before Zlatan Ibrahimovic doubled the Parisian's advantage from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Substitutes Blaise Matuidi and Javier Pastore secured the win after Yoann Touzghar had pulled one back deficit for Lens. Lyon will return to the Ligue 1 summit should it dispose of Montpelier Sunday.

Article text: (CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied. That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. "I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big," Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. "Thanks for all the support and prayers," a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. "I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger." CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page. But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. So high, that it is taking five surgeons, a covey of physician assistants, nurses and anesthesiologists, and more than 40 support staff to perform surgeries on 12 people. They are extracting six kidneys from donors and implanting them into six recipients. "The ages of the donors and recipients range from 26 to 70 and include three parent and child pairs, one sibling pair and one brother and sister-in-law pair," the medical center said in a statement. The chain of surgeries is to be wrapped up Friday. In late March, the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients. Here's how the super swap works, according to California Pacific Medical Center. Say, your brother needs a kidney to save his life, or at least get off of dialysis, and you're willing to give him one of yours. But then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him, and it's certain his body would reject it. Your brother can then get on a years-long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died. Maybe that will work out -- or not, and time could run out for him. Alternatively, you and your brother could look for another recipient-living donor couple like yourselves -- say, two more siblings, where the donor's kidney isn't suited for his sister, the recipient. But maybe your kidney is a match for his sister, and his kidney is a match for your brother. So, you'd do a swap. That's called a paired donation. It's a bit of a surgical square dance, where four people cross over partners temporarily and everybody goes home smiling. But instead of a square dance, Broussard's generous move set off a chain reaction, like dominoes falling. Her kidney, which was removed Thursday, went to a recipient, who was paired with a donor. That donor's kidney went to the next recipient, who was also paired with a donor, and so on. On Friday, the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain. Such long-chain transplanting is rare. It's been done before, California Pacific Medical Center said in a statement, but matching up the people in the chain has been laborious and taken a long time. That changed when a computer programmer named David Jacobs received a kidney transplant. He had been waiting on a deceased donor list, when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger. Jacobs paid it forward with his programming skills, creating MatchGrid, a program that genetically matches up donor pairs or chains quickly. "When we did a five-way swap a few years ago, which was one of the largest, it took about three to four months. We did this in about three weeks," Jacobs said. But this chain wouldn't have worked so quickly without Broussard's generosity -- or may not have worked at all. "The significance of the altruistic donor is that it opens up possibilities for pairing compatible donors and recipients," said Dr. Steven Katznelson. "Where there had been only three or four options, with the inclusion of the altruistic donor, we had 140 options to consider for matching donors and recipients." And that's divine, Broussard's friend Shirley Williams wrote in a comment her on Broussard's Facebook page. "You are a true angel my friend."

Article text: (CNN)On the 6th of April 1996, San Jose Clash and DC United strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California. The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer. Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous "birth of a new era for American soccer." Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia. Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half. Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper. As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period. Long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start. Attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015. A further four are set to be added by 2020. On top of this, the new season is the first of a new domestic TV and media rights deal with FOX, ESPN and Univision worth $700 million over eight years. This figure may pale beside the $5.1 billion recently paid by UK broadcasters for the English Premier League, the richest football league in the world, but it represents a tripling in value of the previous MLS deal. According to Phil Rawlins, co-primary owner and president of the new MLS franchise, Orlando City Soccer Club, "the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically" in the U.S.. He believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the MLS. Rawlins' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation. He describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago. This weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness Orlando City's opening weekend fixture against New York City, another new club making their MLS bow. World Cup winners Kaka and David Villa will turn out for Orlando and New York City respectively. "We're just on the crest of the wave at the moment," Rawlins said of football's American progress. "Can it be the number two, number three sport in this country? Yes, I think it can. And it can be in a short space of time." These positive assertions are backed by the huge interest U.S. fans showed in last year's World Cup in Brazil. Team USA's group stage clash with Portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from TV ratings firm, Nielsen. That's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 World Series averaged on FOX or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 NBA finals on ABC. Anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out Chicago's Grant Park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the U.S. now being anything other than a big deal. Reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. The MLS was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. Three teams -- Miami Fusion, Tampa Bay Mutiny (both in 2001) and Chivas USA (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. A report by Forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 MLS teams were profitable. And as recently as this week, MLS players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. Then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. A salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. Each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to "off budget" signings which are not included within the cap. This includes promising Generation Adidas players who enter the MLS through the draft systems before completing their college education. Homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (DPs), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. One of the main criticisms of the MLS and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like David Beckham, Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry to appear in the MLS, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. Why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? And herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. Although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means MLS teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. Head coach of Sporting Kansas, Peter Vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the Kansas City Star newspaper last year. "We're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. We have a salary cap. They don't," Vermes said. According to Paulo Teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the MLS grow yet further. He describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with European passports. Such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the MLS to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the Atlantic. Theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the MLS. This in turn will raise the standard further. An early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of Oriol Rossell, a Spanish midfielder who moved from Sporting Kansas to Sporting Lisbon last year in a deal brokered by Teixeira. Rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by FC Barcelona in 2012. He excelled at Kansas, winning the MLS Cup before being sold to the Portuguese giants at a profit in June 2014. Teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. It could also be achieved by signing DPs closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. This last point is something that appears be happening already. "Before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in Europe," Teixeira said. "(But) Villa is not an old guy, (Frank) Lampard is still going strong" and both could still offer something to teams in Europe, he said by way of example of New York City's first DP signings. Nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  "is probably something we'll see more of." Whether Teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. Either way, that brave new MLS dawn that broke over San Jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning.

Article text: (CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now "feeling well" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was "fine," with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. "I wanted to reassure you concerning my health," Gomis told the website. "It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. "I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. "I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages." Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: "We can't not be worried, it scares you each time." Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. "He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems," Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. "It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. "It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks." Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January. Almost exactly three years ago at White Hart Lane, then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was near death,  according to Bolton, but survived after being treated at the London Chest Hospital. He subsequently retired. Other footballers, including Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe in 2003 and Spanish international Antonio Puerta in 2007, didn't survive after collapsing on the pitch.

Article text: (CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Happy Gilmore than the world's reigning No 1. player. But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character. Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. "(It) felt good at the time," a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. "I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had of been any other club I probably wouldn't have but I didn't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not." The club "must have went a good 60, 70 yards," he joked. McIlroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader JB Holmes. While an improvement on last weeks performance at the Honda Classic event, where he failed to make the cut, the Northern Irishman's frustration with elements of his game was still clear. "I think every golfer feels it because I don't hit shots like the one I hit on 8 on the range," he said. "That's what really bothers me, the fact that I get out on the course and I hit shots that I'm not seeing when I'm in a more relaxed environment. "So it's a little bit of mental, a little bit of physical. It's just everything is not quite matching up." Elsewhere on the course, Ryan Holmes scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall, two shots behind Holmes. Former world No 1., Adam Scott carded an impressive 68 to finish the day three shots off the pace at six-under while Bubba Watson and Henrik Stenson are tied for fourth on four-under.

Article text: (CNN)A Pennsylvania community is pulling together to search for an eighth-grade student who has been missing since Wednesday. The search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online. The parents of Cayman Naib, 13, have been communicating through the Facebook group "Find Cayman" since a day after his disappearance, according to close friend David Binswanger. Newtown Police say Cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants and hiking boots. He could be in the Radnor-Wayne area, roughly 20 miles from Philadelphia, or may have purchased a train ticket to Philadelphia, according to an alert posted on Facebook. "We think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act," Farid Naib, Cayman's father, wrote Thursday on the group page. "We have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is. Cayman does have his phone, we don't know if he has any cash, he does not have his wallet." The parents said that his phone was out of power at the time. "Cayman left within 30 minutes after he received an email from school regarding overdue home work (we do not blame the school) and most probably did not do any pre planning ... He is a good kid, and has no substance abuse or other issues, this is the first time he has ever done anything like this," his father and mother, Becky Naib, posted Friday. The parents wrote Saturday that Cayman was not wearing waterproof clothing and that he did not take his backpack. Binswanger said weather limited search efforts Wednesday, the night Cayman went missing. Wednesday it was rainy and Thursday there was 6-8 inches of snow. Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up to pass out fliers and to canvass areas, according to posts. A post late Saturday explained search efforts included "advanced, geo-spacial tracking software to determine the exact locations where searchers went," and added that the search would be taken to the skies Sunday with deployment of the Civil Air Patrol. In many posts, the families appealed directly to their son. "Cayman, if you read this please know that you are forgiven for everything, and I mean everything, you have the ultimate free pass. Just come home, we are so worried about you" the family posted Saturday. A message to families from the head of The Shipley School, which Cayman attends, read in part: "Cayman's sister Savannah is in ninth grade at Shipley and his parents, Farid and Becky, are terrific people. They have contacted police and are aware that we are sending you this email. We hope that Cayman is ok and are saying our prayers." CNN could not immediately get in touch with police or the FBI.

Article text: (CNN)My vote for Father of the Year goes to Curt Schilling. The former Major League Baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of Twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about Schilling's teenage daughter. The drama started, innocently enough, on February 25, when Schilling played the role of a proud father. He sent a tweet congratulating his daughter, Gabby, on being accepted to Salve Regina University, where she'll play softball. It read: "Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!! — Curt Schilling (@gehrig38)" Almost immediately, responses came in from young men, complete strangers who apparently followed Schilling on Twitter. The tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant. Threats of rape were common. The tweets were deleted, and the accounts were closed after this story went viral. But not before Schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog. What was said about 17-year-old Gabby Schilling wasn't just obnoxious. It was vile and obscene. What was said wasn't just mean and ugly. It was threatening and scary. As a parent, it's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions. These misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity, the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites, where you feel free to be a  despicable human being because, you think, no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words. If so, they thought wrong. They couldn't hide. They were found out, and they got the throttling they so richly deserved. Thanks to dad. According to Schilling, who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are, two people have already paid a price due to their tweets. One was a student disc jockey at a community college in New Jersey, who was suspended, and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the New York Yankees, who was fired. Concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide, Schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved. Bravo for him. I'm sure that, all across America, dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at Schilling's self-control. I have two daughters of my own, and he's a better man than me. If ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap, this is it. So what additional insights can we draw, and what larger lessons can we learn, from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media? There are a few. The first is about accountability, the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid. But Schilling wouldn't let them. At their best, social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community. At their worst, they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences. We need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability. There's also something to be said about protective parents, and how essential they are to a working society. We should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews. We shouldn't bubblewrap our kids, and keep them from playing outdoors, and then sit around wondering why they're soft, timid, and risk-averse. But protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style. A parent's top job is to protect his children. Schilling did his job. Finally, it's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules, standards, and expectations that should guide your behavior. There are things you don't say. There are boundaries, ways that we expect you to behave so you don't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself, your friends, and your family. If you don't have social skills, you don't belong on social media. The tweets make you wince. But in this story, you'll still find plenty to smile about. This whole drama unfolded because Schilling was proud of his daughter. Now, given how he reacted, we all have reason to be proud of him. ​ .

Article text: (CNN)Another one for the "tourists behaving badly" file. Two American women have reportedly been arrested for carving their initials into a wall with a coin inside Rome's Colosseum. Daily Italian newspaper La Stampa says the women, aged 21 and 25, were spotted carrying out the act by fellow tourists, who then told security. The two letters -- J and N -- were about eight inches in length and scratched on a brick wall at the historic Roman amphitheater. The women, both from California, reportedly snapped a selfie of themselves with their initials before they were arrested. Their names have not been released. The American pair may now face a fine for "aggravated damage" on a building of historical and artistic interest. If one Russian's experience is anything to go by, the price won't be cheap. Last November, authorities in Rome slapped a 20,000-euro ($21,685) penalty on a Russian tourist caught carving his name into the famed landmark. The 42-year-old man was apprehended after a guard at the Colosseum saw him carve the letter "K" in a section of brickwork. After police caught up with him, the man was found guilty of causing aggravated damage, fined and given a four-month suspended sentence. The Russian was one of five tourists caught carving graffiti on Colosseum walls in 2014. The earlier incidents involved two Australians -- a father and son -- and a Canadian and a Brazilian, both teenagers. Rome isn't alone in having to deal with inappropriate tourist behavior this month. Egypt is now looking into reports that one of its most historic sites was the backdrop for a Russian porn flick. According to Al Arabiya News, authorities have confirmed that an X-rated film was shot next to the Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx and are now investigating. The video was reportedly made by Russian tourists, who then uploaded it to the Internet nine months ago. Al Arabiya reports that Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh al-Demati says the issue has been referred to the public prosecutor and new surveillance cameras are being installed in the area. The incident comes as a reminder that no world landmark is safe from the salacious urges of tourists -- no matter how sacred it might be to the locals. Cambodia's Angkor Archeological Park experienced its own string of nudity-related incidents this year. In February, U.S. tourists and sisters Lindsey Kate Adams and Leslie Jan Adams were deported after allegedly getting caught taking partially nude photos at Preah Khan temple, one of the sacred sites inside Cambodia's Angkor complex. They received six-month suspended prison sentences, a one-million riel ($250) fine and were banned from entering the country for four years. In January, a group of photos featuring a topless dancer leaning against the ruins surfaced on Facebook. Early last year, Peru officials were forced to respond to a chain of "naked tourism" incidents at Machu Picchu, also a World Heritage Site. They detained four American tourists, two Canadians and two Australians for stripping down for pictures at the site. CNN's Barry Neild contributed to this report.

Article text: (CNN)A shooting at a bar popular with expatriates in Mali on Saturday killed five people, including French and Belgian citizens, authorities said. One French citizen, one Belgian and three Malians were killed in the attack in the capital of Bamako, said Gabriel Toure, director of a local hospital. An additional eight people were wounded, he said. Authorities called the shooting a "criminal and terrorist act." "Mali remains committed to seeking peace and will not be intimidated by those who have no other motives than to do away (with) the prospects of peace and harmony amongst the Malians," the government said in a statement. A North African jihadist group, al-Murabitun, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to Mauritanian news agency Al Akhbar. The purported claim came in an audio message in which the group said it carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing of one of its leaders, Al Akhbar said. "Al-Murabitun may be considered a regional competitor to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)," according to the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm. The U.S. State Department said in January that al-Murabitun is a "newly-formed" militant group that has presence in northern Mali. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the victim from his country was 31 years old. French President Francois Hollande released a statement condemning the attack. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his condolences to the victims' families in a news conference in Paris on Saturday. "This is an act of cowardice," he said. "But an act of opening fire in a restaurant filled with innocent civilians -- in the end, that only strengthens our resolve to fight terrorism in all of its forms, wherever it exists." The French Embassy in Bamako warned its citizens to be on alert if they go out in public. Though it's unclear whether any rebel group is responsible for the attack, Malian forces have battled Islamist militants in the northern part of the nation for years. Fabius said the Malian government was interrogating some suspects. Mali plunged into chaos after soldiers staged a coup three years ago. As a result, Tuareg fighters capitalized on the power vacuum to launch an insurgency that ended with their takeover of the north. After the Tuareg fighters seized the region, a power struggle erupted with local Islamist radicals. The extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of a large piece of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Since then, the nation has battled various rebel factions, mostly in the northern region, with the help of French and African forces. CNN's Brian Walker, Joshua Berlinger and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.

Article text: (CNN)Manchester United defender Jonny Evans and Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly spitting during an altercation in Wednesday night's Premier League game at St James' Park. In a statement, English football's governing body said the players had been charged "in relation to an alleged breach of FA Rule E1[a] in that in or around the 38th minute of the game the two players spat at each other. "The incidents were not seen by the match officials but [were] caught on video." The players have until 6pm GMT on Friday to respond to the charge, and could face six-game bans if found guilty. Both Evans and Cisse released statements the day after the incident, with Evans saying: "I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Cisse." Cisse's statement said: "I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down." Spitting at another player is considered beyond the pale by professional footballers, and former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, now a TV pundit, told the BBC's Match of the Day programme the incident had been "disgusting." "This is not acceptable," he said. "There are kids watching. Something has to be done. The behaviour towards each other and the referee is deteriorating on a weekly basis." Ex-Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes said he did not believe Evans had deliberately spat at Cisse, telling BT Sport: "Look, it's not very nice. I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. "I know Jonny -- he's not that type of person. If he wants to do that then it's not hard to miss, is it? He's only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable." And former Liverpool player Steve McManaman told the channel: "Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans' neck from about six inches. It's absolutely disgusting. "Two wrongs do not make a right. If Jonny Evans has spat at him then it's wrong, but for Papiss Cisse to get up and react like that is absolutely disgusting. We talk about bad tackles, but that is worse."

Article text: (CNN)Nine foreign workers are believed to be in the hands of ISIS-affiliated militants after an attack on a Libyan oil field, according to officials. Libya's internationally recognized government has blamed "ISIS militias" for the attack Friday in which the Al-Ghani oil field was set on fire. The kidnapped foreigners were working for VAOS, an Austrian-owned oil services company whose headquarters are in Tripoli, the Libyan capital. They include four Filipinos, an Austrian, a Czech and a Ghanaian, according to the Philippine foreign ministry. The Bangladeshi government said one of its citizens was also taken hostage. The nationality of the ninth worker was unclear. The abductions come amid Libya's deteriorating security situation in which Islamic militias, some of them pledging allegiance to the extremist group ISIS, have thrived. Egypt carried out airstrikes against ISIS militants in Libya last month after the killings of Egyptian Christians who had been kidnapped while working in a Libyan city. The Philippine foreign ministry said Monday that its Tripoli embassy had "stepped up coordination" with the Austrian company and Libyan authorities "to locate the abducted Filipinos and ensure their safe and immediate release." Martin Weiss, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry tweeted Monday that "credible sources" had confirmed that the Austrian citizen and other international workers were in the hands of ISIS "terrorists." The attack on Al-Ghani is the latest in a recent spate of violence by militants targeting oil fields in Libya. The Libyan National Oil Corporation said over the weekend that it had warned VAOS more than two weeks ago to leave the area because of security concerns. VAOS wasn't immediately available for comment Tuesday. The Philippine foreign ministry said 52 other Filipinos are employed by VAOS but were relocated out of Al-Ghani "much earlier" and are now in Tripoli. Three other Filipinos have been missing in Libya since they were seized at the Mabruk oil field in February, the foreign ministry said. "These cases underscore the escalating threat to the safety and security of Filipino oil workers in Libyan oil fields which have been targeted by armed groups in recent weeks," said foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose. He said Philippine authorities were unsure at this point whether the kidnappers were ISIS members. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Marilia Brocchetto, and journalists Ayman Kekly and Arlene Samson-Espiritu, contributed to this report.

Article text: (CNN)Think back to your high school's senior prank. Maybe you and your pals slipped a pig into the building or greased all the door handles or turned all the chairs upside-down. So it's no surprise that Wichita high school Principal Sherman Padgett was reluctant to play along last week when a student showed up and told him to stand in the hallway holding a bucket. "She didn't say anything about why. She just said 'hold the bucket,' " the North High School principal told CNN affiliate KWCH. "I'm not going to hold the bucket unless I have a little inkling of why it could be." Good thing he changed his mind. Once he did, student after student streamed by, dropping notes of praise and thanks into the bucket. "Thank you for making high school the best years of my life," one said. "You've made my first year experience in America one that I will always fondly remember," read another. One student recalled how Padgett "helped me get through my eating disorder and helped me get into therapy." The notes were the idea of senior Emily Jones. She decided she wanted to do something nice for the principal and cooked up the plan with her mother. "Padgett's an awesome principal," she said. For Padgett, who has been principal at North since 2006, the experience was priceless. "Became a little emotional on some of them," he said, "I kind of read them and thought, 'man, this is better than a paycheck. This is why I do the things that I do.' "

Article text: (CNN)Jessie Usher, the lead of Starz's series "Survivor's Remorse," has been cast in Fox's sequel "Independence Day 2." Liam Hemsworth has also been cast in a lead role and Jeff Goldblum will reprise his role as David Levinson from the original. It has been nearly 20 years since the Will Smith-starring sci-fi film hit theaters, grossing more than $800 million worldwide at the box office. Director Roland Emmerich will return to helm the film. "Independence Day 2" is set for release on June 24, 2016 — almost exactly 20 years from when the first film hit theaters on July 3, 1996. Dean Devlin, Emmerich and Harald Kloser are producing. Independence Day 2 is a big get for Usher, who will play a central character in the new film as the son of Smith's character. Smith's role in the first blockbuster helped establish him as a star, kicking his career up to the next level. Usher stars in the Lebron James-produced Starz TV series "Survivor's Remorse" as Cam Calloway, a basketball player who moves with his family to Atlanta after he signs a pro contract. The first season premiered Oct. 4, 2014, and Starz quickly renewed the show for a second season, which will air later this year. The rising star's film credits includes TriStar football drama When the Game Stands Tall, which hit theaters in August. On the TV side, he previously starred in the Cartoon Network's series Level Up. He's repped by Paradigm and Williams Unlimited. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.

Article text: (CNN)Former Vice President Walter Mondale was released from the Mayo Clinic on Saturday after being admitted with influenza, hospital spokeswoman Kelley Luckstein said. "He's doing well. We treated him for flu and cold symptoms and he was released today," she said. Mondale, 87, was diagnosed after he went to the hospital for a routine checkup following a fever, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday. "He is in the bed right this moment, but looking forward to come back home," Carter said during a speech at a Nobel Peace Prize Forum in Minneapolis. "He said tell everybody he is doing well." Mondale underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The 42nd vice president served under Carter between 1977 and 1981, and later ran for President, but lost to Ronald Reagan. But not before he made history by naming a woman, U.S. Rep. Geraldine A. Ferraro of New York, as his running mate. Before that, the former lawyer was  a U.S. senator from Minnesota. His wife, Joan Mondale, died last year.

Article text: (CNN)The only thing crazier than a guy in snowbound Massachusetts boxing up the powdery white stuff and offering it for sale online? People are actually buying it. For $89, self-styled entrepreneur Kyle Waring will ship you 6 pounds of Boston-area snow in an insulated Styrofoam box -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs, he says. But not if you live in New England or surrounding states. "We will not ship snow to any states in the northeast!" says Waring's website, ShipSnowYo.com. "We're in the business of expunging snow!" His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on Tuesday alone, his busiest day yet. With more than 45 total inches, Boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history. Most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance, but Waring saw an opportunity. According to Boston.com, it all started a few weeks ago, when Waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a coastal suburb north of Boston. He joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states, and an idea was born. His business slogan: "Our nightmare is your dream!" At first, ShipSnowYo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $19.99, but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination. So this week, Waring began shipping larger amounts in the Styrofoam cubes, which he promises will arrive anywhere in the U.S. in less than 20 hours. He also has begun selling a 10-pound box of snow for $119. Many of his customers appear to be companies in warm-weather states who are buying the snow as a gag, he said. Whether Waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen. But he has no shortage of product. "At this rate, it's going to be July until the snow melts," he told Boston.com. "But I've thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items. Maybe I'll ship some fall foliage."

Article text: (CNN)Farah fled the civil war in Syria with her husband in the middle of the night, hitching rides on trucks until they finally crossed into Jordan. Two days later, she gave birth to a girl in a country where they hold no status. Like 70,000 other refugees from Syria, Iraq, Sudan and the Palestinian Territories, Farah (her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity) now lives with her family in Zarqa, a poor Jordanian city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks. Men dominate public spaces, and many women stay at home, isolated. Two years ago, Farah was a nurse and her husband a lawyer. Here, he found work tiling construction sites, but was arrested three times for working illegally. "Now my husband stays at home, depressed and afraid of being sent to the camps," Farah said. She is now the family breadwinner, working at a local organization providing educational programs to Syrian and Jordanian children. Every day she navigates the dangers of Zarqa's crime-ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men. Yet Zarqa is also a pocket of hope. Some 384 female refugees working with the Near East Foundation  have been able to re-establish savings, restore dignity, strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives. Many of them choose to become earners for the first time. They belong to a network of Jordanian and refugee women -- coaches, mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support, exchange tips and build friendships. Some 80% of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home-based business. Fatiya, who escaped Iraq during the 2003 invasion, was surviving on charity until six months ago. Now she runs her own leather goods home-based business, making belts, wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home. These days, Fatiya is busy rebuilding her life. "I make my own way,"she says. Zainab, also an Iraqi refugee, is now a hairdresser in Zarqa. On the side, she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women, walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent. On March 8, we celebrate International Women's Day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who, like Farah, Fatiya and Zainab, continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination, creativity and skill, despite increasingly limited options. Aid agencies must match the strength of these women's resilience. To truly assist them, we must empower them with opportunities and choices. Of the 10.5 million refugees registered with UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, less than 1% are eventually resettled. The rest remain in limbo, forced to forge new lives in places where they often have no right to work. Refugees are displaced for an average of 20 years, and more than half disappear into urban sprawls where they struggle to integrate and start their lives over. Humanitarian assistance and media attention tend to fixate on "immediate" aid -- distribution of cash, food and subsistence items. This is unsustainable. UNHCR provides critical cash assistance to refugees in Jordan -- but this can be as little as $71 a month, 16 times below the country's poverty line. Refugees need to supplement their allowances, yet they cannot legally find employment, and working in the informal sector can be dangerous. Farah, Fatiya and Zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy. But their increased role as earners challenges cultural norms, exposing them to heightened abuse and violence. Women's ability to generate income does not guarantee economic independence. To help this network of women control the income they earn, the Near East Foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives' and daughters' newfound roles. "In the beginning, these women were tremendously shy -- they didn't talk," says Hamdan Eliemat, who heads the Bani Hasan Islamic Society, a community organization supporting the women. He laughs. "And now they won't stop talking. And we men, now we have to listen." The international community must advocate for refugees' right to survive. We must ensure that beyond immediate aid, women have access to skill-building, financial resources, social networks and protection from violence and harassment, so they have the chance to build their own futures.

Article text: (CNN)Real Madrid fell to a lacklustre 1-0 defeat at the hands of Athletic Bilbao Saturday, potentially handing the La Liga advantage to arch rival Barcelona. A stunning header from Aritz Aduriz shortly before half time was enough to win the day for an organized and impressive Bilbao. Real piled on the pressure for much of the second half but couldn't find a way past a staunch opponent despite finishing the match with four strikers on the park. Gareth Bale struck a post with an extraordinary shot from close to the halfway line as full time approached while Arduriz almost doubled Bilbao's lead with another headed chance late on. The result means second placed Barca can now take top spot should it win at home to mid-table Rayo Vallecano Sunday. Of more immediate concern to Real boss Carlo Ancelotti after the game, however, was his side's lack of cutting edge. "I think the problem we are having at the moment is quite clear," Ancelotti told reporters. "We are not finding a way through like we did in the games before. We've only scored one goal, from a penalty, in two games. "That is the problem we have to fix. We lack efficiency up front." Real are now without a win in two league games while the 4-0 February hammering at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid, the clubs biggest derby defeat since 1947, is still fresh in the memory. With the second El Classico fixture of the season against Barcelona only a fortnight away, Ancelotti is looking for a quick fix to his side's attacking inhibitions. However, such worries are of little concern to a Bilbao side celebrating its first win over Real in five years. After a slow start to the season the Basques are now up to eighth position. "We are very proud of how hard we worked," goalscorer Arduriz said in comments carried by the AFP news agency. "The three points will prove a huge boost." "The fans have enjoyed it a lot and they deserved that after the poor performances at San Mames earlier in the season." Bayern Munich continued its seemingly inexorable march to a third consecutive Bundesliga title with a come from behind 3-1 victory away to Hannover. Hiroshi Kiyotake gave the hosts a surprise lead after 25 minutes but Xabi Alonso levelled shortly after. A second half brace from Thomas Muller ensured the Bavarians would increase their league at the top of the Bundesliga to 11 points as second place Wolfsburg fell to a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Elsewhere Saturday, Borussia Dortmund's winning streak came to an end with as Jurgen Klopp's revitalized side were held to a 0-0 draw with Hamburg. Paris Saint Germain returned to the top of the Ligue 1 table, for 24 hours at least, with a convincing 4-1 win over Lens at the Parc de Princes. David Luiz opened the scoring as the first half came to a close before Zlatan Ibrahimovic doubled the Parisian's advantage from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Substitutes Blaise Matuidi and Javier Pastore secured the win after Yoann Touzghar had pulled one back deficit for Lens. Lyon will return to the Ligue 1 summit should it dispose of Montpelier Sunday.

Older daughter Billups had been in labor since the day before, but she didn't give birth to son Jerry Michaud Jr until 34 minutes after Patram. Dr Atef Zakhary delivered both babies, as well as two of Patram's older children, and described it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 'I've been in this field for 29 years ... I've seen maybe 14,000 deliveries,' Dr. Zakhary said in a statement on the hospital's website. 'I've never seen a mom and daughter deliver on the same day. And this is as close as you could get.' While Patram is sad she couldn't be with her daughter for the delivery, and be the first to see her new grandson, the mother daughter duo took pictures shortly after they were both rested from delivery. Double the fun: Patram says they knew their due dates were close, but never imagined giving birth on the same day. Pictured above with Angela's son CJ, center . Extraordinary: Dr Zakhary says he's never seen a mother and daughter give birth on the same day in his 29 years delivering babies . With them to mark the occasion was the Patram's other children Angelique, 14; Alicia, 13; and CJ, 4. Billups partner Jerry Michaud Sr and baby Rayna's father were also in attendance on the happy occasion. Patram's mother was frantically running between rooms to make sure both her daughter and granddaughter were supported through the birth. One month after delivery, both babies are doing well and living at Patram's home in Gibsonton, Florida. 'When we sit both babies next to each other, they just look at each other really closely,' Billups said. "It's weird seeing two babies of the same size in the house." Billups and Michaud are currently living with her mother while they search for a home of their own nearby. Billups studies biology at Florida A&M University, but plans to transfer to a college closer to home.

Article text: A computer expert has managed track down the delighted owner of a memory stick full of treasured photographs living half way across the world, two years after she believed they were lost forever. Jonathan Stainsby, 26, was handed two USB sticks by a friend after they lay unclaimed for two years after being discovered in a Marks and Spencer store. The memory sticks were full of photographs, and IT expert and photography enthusiast Jonathan quickly realised how precious the images could be and determined to find the owner. Amazing: Jonathan  managed use technology to track down the photos' owner  half way across the world . Technology: When Jonathan put this picture in, it matched to a woman called Narien - who would eventually turn out to be the owner of the photographs . So he set about selecting images and running them through Google image search, trying to get the perfect match. And his hard work paid off, when he managed to find the name Narien. But even with the unusual name, he was still struggling to find the mystery owner. 'None of the names was Narien, so I went onto Facebook and trawled through some of the photographs of people with that name to see if I recognised anyone from the pictures,' he explained. 'Then I went back to the USB stick and looked at some of the documents on it and found the surname Meyer. 'I typed that in Facebook and a lady called Narien Meyer, from South Africa, came up and I managed to positively identify her.' Narien, it transpired, was a teacher now living in Oman - almost 4,000 miles from Jonathan's home in Hartlepool. Extra: Jonathan then turned back to the USB sticks to find more information, and then found a surname . Then he hit another hurdle: he sent a message to Narien, to let her know he had found her photos. But she didn't respond, so he did a little more sleuthing work and found a friend who was willing to help. And finally, he was able get the pictures back to their rightful owner, who is said to be 'absolutely delighted'. Narien sent Jonathan a thank you message saying that she believes she lost the sticks possibly on a visit to Barnard Castle in 2013. It said: 'Thank you so much for getting my pics back to me! I lost my bag with the USBs in it in Barnard Castle two years ago - or so I thought. 'We probably stopped at other places as well but I'm not that familiar with the area. 'Amazing that after two years you got it back to me I'm now in Saudi Arabia, and most of the photos were taken in Kuwait and Oman, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where I've been teaching. 'Thanks to you I'll have my memories!' Jonathan is equally as pleased. 'I had a one in 7.126billion chance of success and with hard work I accomplished it - and made new friends some 3,6660 miles away,' he said.

Article text: Arsene Wenger never knows when he is wrong, and that flaw has cost the Arsenal manager, according to his former midfielder Emmanuel Petit. Petit, who was part of Wenger's team at Tuesday night's opponents Monaco before joining him at Highbury in 1997, won the double under the Frenchman the next year, and has known the Arsenal boss for three decades. But as well as praising his former manager's work ethic, the former Gunners star, 44, also questioned Wenger's stubbornness and inability to switch off. Arsene Wenger is preparing to take Arsenal back to his old club Monaco in the Champions League . Petit (right) worked with Wenger at both clubs, but says his former manager has a striking fault . 'He's a workaholic, someone who lives for the job,' Petit told France Football. 'He has a passion, almost pathological, for football. He almost forgets to live his own life. He never disconnects. 'For 35 years he has coached, I've know him for nearly 30, and he has never changed. He has another flaw: he does not recognise when he is wrong.' Petit revealed that, at times of stress, Wenger can be found walking barefoot around the training ground to get back in touch with nature. 'He has tics,' the Premier League winning midfielder continued. For example, when he's fuming and needs to think, he must walk barefoot in the grass. He needs to be in contact with the elements, like in The Matrix!' Petit signed for the Gunners in 1997, alongside Marc Overmars (right), and won the double under Wenger . The Frenchmen celebrate winning the league in 1998, but Petit has said Wenger can be too stubborn . However, the former Gunners midfielder did praise Wenger's man management and his work ethic . Wenger's great strength, however, according to Petit, is his ability to get the best out of his players by understanding them on a personal level. 'Before you are even interested in the football player, he is interested in the individual,' said Petit. 'He attaches great importance to human relations. He is very attentive to detail.' Petit departed Arsenal in 2000 for a short stint at Barcelona, after playing just one season with the man who would go on to become the club's record goalscorer, Thierry Henry. But Petit was quick to stress that his compatriot, who has been working back at the club while doing his coaching badges, should not be talked about as Wenger's successor yet. Thierry Henry, Arsenal's record goalscorer during two spells at the club, has been tipped to succeed Wenger . But Petit says Henry, who was part of the 2004 Invincibles, should not be thought of as a manager yet . 'It's way too early to tell [if Henry can succeed Wenger],' he told RMC Sport. 'We live in a society where fast food is consumed very quickly and we also quickly discard what was consumed. For Henry, as with Zidane, he needs time. 'You do not become a coach just because you pass your degrees. It's like when you become a parent. One becomes a function of his children, we adapt, we learn about ourselves. So getting the degree is one thing. Become a coach week after week, that's something else.'

Article text: The knowledge that your son has committed murder is more than any mother should have to bear. For one mother though, the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother. In 2008, Franky Regan Lamb faced the news that her 21-year-old son Rakeim Regan had fatally stabbed her mother, Pat Regan,  in her own home, in Leeds. Scroll down for video . In a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, Franky Regan Lamb has spoken out about the horrifying incident in 2008 when her son, Rakeim Regan, murdered her mother Pat . Now in a new episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos, which aired yesterday on the CI channel, Franky, her brother Shane and their friends have spoken out about the horrific incident which will haunt the family forever. Rakeim, who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture, killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis. His mental state seriously deteriorated after his Uncle Danny - Pat's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene. Rakeim had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that Danny, a notorious drug dealer, might be a bad influence on him. Danny, who mixed in such a dangerous crowd that he often wore a stab vest and carried a firearm, was shot to death in 2002, following what was thought to be an altercation about drugs. Following her son's death Pat went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and, according to Franky, had a close relationship with Rakeim. Murdered Pat Regan (right) was an anti-gun campaigner, pictured here with fellow campaigner Michelle Forbes outside  Downing Street in 2008 . Slain uncle: Pat's son Danny was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs . She said: 'If he was in trouble, he'd go to my mum probably more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better. He was her grandson - they were just really close.' Despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about Rakeim as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence. His uncle Shane admitted: 'We had worries about him, because it seemed that he was impressed with, kind of gang culture or the big man in the area and all that kind of stuff. 'You know, there was a lot of that around us at the time and we were just, kind of like, saying, "You don't need to be focused on that kind of stuff. You need to focus more on your education, your music" - you know, things that are quite playful, things that are positive. 'Don't look at the negative and don't be, you know, tempted to follow that kind of lifestyle.' Sadly, there was nothing the family could do to help him and as Rakeim started to dabble more and more in drugs, his paranoia started to increase. Franky said: 'He kind of lost his way a little bit and I, kind of, guess he dabbled in drugs in his teenage years, in ecstasy, cocaine, and I used to say to Rakeim, "You haven't got the mind-set to get through stuff like that, you know, take ecstasy and things like that. It's not good for you and it'll bring you down." 'He would go, "I know mum, I don't do it any more."' Rakeim's uncle Shane Regan showed off a selection of pictures of his mother. He says he has not been to see his nephew since he fatally stabbed his mother . Shane said: 'He was having thoughts of people turning into reptiles, aliens, he was having these kinds of thoughts. 'People's eye colours were changing, you know, to these luminous colours. He threatened my brother to say that he was going to stab him in his neck. 'It was like he was almost possessed with something that he wanted to be. He wanted to be a hard man, he wanted to be tough, he wanted to be fearless. 'He wanted to be this character that wasn't him and my mum was like, "Well, I let him go out tonight, god knows what's going to happen to him."' Finally - following an incident in which Rakeim was found stumbling around a park near his home in a state of psychosis - he was taken to hospital. It was to prove too little, too late. The day after his release Pat, who had taken Rakeim in, went missing. She was meant to attend an anti-gun event being hosted by Shane but the alarm was raised when she failed to show up. Shane was horrified when he was called to his mother's house after she failed to show up to an anti-gun meeting that he was holding, only to find out that she had been killed. Shane was eventually called to come down to his mother's house, where he learned the devastating news that Pat had been stabbed to death. Franky said: 'I was hysterical. I would give anything, you know, to have my mum back. You know, to hear that call, I've had that call before about my brother, about my younger brother.' Worse news was to come when the family made the horrifying discovery that it was Rakeim behind the killing. However, Franky has come to understand that it was his mental health problems which made him act the way he did. 'The realisation that your son's done what he's done, it's just gut-wrenching. I never felt, "You horrible, horrible person." I never felt that. 'Part of me sometimes thinks, "Would it be easier to dislike, not love Rakeim if he hadn't been a drug addict and he'd have killed her because he wanted money for drugs or something, or he was just a nasty person? 'Because he wasn't, and it was the mental health, and he loved his grandma, and he wasn't a bad person, it just makes it that much harder knowing that - what a nice lad he was.' Having pleaded guilty to manslaughter Rakeim is now detained indefinitely under the mental health act and Franky goes to visit him on a regular basis. She said the first encounter was difficult: 'First seeing him, where he was, it was heartbreaking. I didn’t know if he’d remember, and he remembered what he’d done but he was still in a psychotic state. 'He was still delusional about what he’d done and how he’d done it, and to go and sit and listen to your son, your baby, saying this about what he’s done to his grandma and your mum is the worst.' However, Shane has mixed feelings about whether he will see him again: 'Personally I’ve not seen Rakeim since the day that he got sentenced. 'I just found it difficult to find a way to look in his eyes and speak to him about it. I dream about looking him in the eye, I have dreams of seeing him, I have this mixed emotion when I see him. 'I want to run up to him and give him a big hug and say, ‘Do you know what, I love you,’ and then I start to doubt that he did do it by accident.'

Article text: (CNN)Football is the most widely played sport among French youths. Yet, it struggles to attract and retain girls. How can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men? Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff, who has a coached a number of Ligue 1 clubs, notes that for a long time, women's football "was a sport totally marginalized." Stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough, too masculine for girls to play. They were much more likely to compete in basketball, ride horseback, or dance, such as Maïmouna Coulibaly, whose dance company, Les Ambianceuses, is internationally recognized (though overshadowed by her brother, Amedy Coulibaly, the kosher supermarket shooter in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre). But change is afoot. Since the late 1980s, the French Football Federation (FFF) has promoted the sport to women and girls. "Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable development of the women's game," said Gourcuff. Former player and ex-Paris Saint-Germain official Jean-Michel Moutier concurred. Over the past decade "girls have significantly increased the level of play," he said. "I am agreeably surprised by the quality of certain female football matches." The sport's increased television presence helps significantly, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup. "That has changed a bit the image of women's football," Gourcuff said, "notably among young girls." Farid El Alagui, who now plays for Scottish club Hibernian, noticed a dramatic difference in how women's football is perceived back home. "If you look at the French national team," he said, "they've been really good." Les Bleues are presently third in FIFA's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women's World Cup in Canada between June 6 and July 5. The professional women's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play. "There are big clubs like Paris Saint-Germain," El Alagui said, "who are very good and the level of play is quite high." Such examples foster confidence to try to the sport. "I think a lot of girls want to play football," he said. "They're just scared." However, enrollment statistics paint a less exuberant portrait. At ASVCM only seven out of 345 players in the club's football school are girls, and two more play with the club's youth teams in competitions. Such statistics are mirrored nationally. During the 2013-14 season, there were 50,516 licensed girls in the Under-6 to Under-20 demographic, as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age. While few in number, the young girls at ASVCM -- a local sports club based in a town 12 kilometers south of Paris -- are welcomed and respected, observed Catherine Ledemé, who has volunteered with the club for more than a decade. "They are often the 'mascots' of the team," she said. Moreover, they excel on the field. The football section's president Marc Girard proudly boasted that two of ASVCM's young players are in formation with PSG's women's team. For Ledemé, who week-in and week-out ensures the club's conviviality, "football has strong social values." She supports girls playing football, regardless of the game's stereotypes or image, a sentiment indicative of changing or changed attitudes. More is needed, but the continued success of the women's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport.
----------------------------------------
Ground truth Summary: French women's football has long been marginalized, stereotyped as a sport that is too rough and masculine for girls to play .
In recent years an increased television presence has raised the profile of the game, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup .
Enrollment statistics remain low with only about 50,000 licensed girls under 20 years of age compared to almost 1 million boys .

Earlier this year he was sentenced to 90 days at William Sharpe to 'regain competence' and the trial date was pushed back to July. West Virginia State Police advised people who may come in contact with Zuccaro not to approach him and contact them with any information about his possible location. Lieutenant Baylous said that the murder suspect was 'a danger to the public'.

Article text: It was supposed to be a special moment when Laura Strange cradled her newborn daughter in her arms for the first time. But instead of enjoying the happy arrival, the 25-year-old was preparing to say goodbye to the tiny infant. At little over two hours old Haley, swaddled in a hospital blanket, was taken away from her mother and it could be two years before the pair are reunited. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: New mother Laura Strange, 25, is forced to say goodbye to her daughter Haley just hours after she gave birth to the infant . Strange will have to serve the remainder of her two year prison sentence before she can take back custody of her daughter . Little Haley is one of 340 babies born each year to mother's serving sentences at Valley State Prison, in Chowchilla, California. With on average 120 inmates pregnant each month only a handful of women are lucky enough to avoid separation from their infants. Strange said: 'I accept the consequence of my crime; I accept the fact that I broke the law. But what does that have to do with my child? Inmate Laura Strange was shackled to the hospital bed after giving birth to her second child . 'Giving her up was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. 'I hurt every second of the day for her.' Photographer Mark Allen Johnson was allowed access to the prison and its pregnant inmates to capture the struggle of giving birth behind bars. Being pregnant does not secure expectant mother's special treatment at Valley State, the world's largest prison for women. With nearly four thousand inmates, they are forced to continue to rub shoulders with murders and violent offenders at the 640 acre site. 'Being pregnant does not give you better treatment,' one expectant mother complained. Another alleged received threats of violence from her fellow detainees while she was with-child. Blonde-haired Strange was taken from her prison cell at the onset of labour to Madera Community Hospital where she gave birth by cesarean section. Just two hours after the delivery, a booming voice breaks the silence of the ward, 'Strange, fifteen more minutes.' Eager to enjoy their last few moments together, the new mother quickly feeds the infant from a bottle of baby formula whispering: 'Momma doesn't want to send you away on an empty stomach.' Gazing down at the shackles around her ankle that confine her to the hospital bed, Strange shakes her right foot. 'My damn leg fell asleep again,' she moans. 'Five more minutes,' the voice shouts, interrupting her final moments with Haley. Trembling, Strange quietly pleads, 'Why me?' As the newborn finishes her bottle a nurse arrives and prises the infant from her mother's grasp before walking out of the door with the child. Just an hour later Strange is on her way back to Valley State Prison, where she will spend two years behind bars for drugs charges. While she serves the remainder of her sentence her mother, Anita, who is already looking after her son Gerard, will take care of Haley. Expectant mothers: Inmate Laura Strange, pictured with April Green and Simone Anderson, ahead of the birth of her second child . Jasmine Jones, 19, who is nine months pregnant with her first child, waits for a doctors appointment in a holding cell . Pregnant Jasmine Jones, 19, is serving two years for robbery and possession of a deadly weapon . According to the California Department of Correction and Rehabilitation (CDCR), the state has one of the largest prison systems in the world. In the past two decades, the system has grown 554 per cent, raising the number of inmates from 24,569 to 160,655. The Atlantic Monthly asserts that the CDCR 'holds more inmates in its jails and prisons than do France, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Singapore, and the Netherlands combined.' At any given time, approximately 120 are pregnant at Valley State Prison on average each month. But with over 340 babies born annually to female inmates, only a handful of these children are able to avoid separation from their mothers. The State of California operates three mother-infant prisoner programs that allow those who qualify to live in a low-level prison setting with their newborn if the duration of their sentence is less than six years. With as few as 75 beds in the program, many prisoners  are forced to give up their babies for adoption or foster care, or, in some cases, they give parental custody to friends or relatives. Melissa Bates is one of the lucky ones. She and her daughter are serving her  sentence of two years and seven months together at Oakland Community Prisoner Mother Program (CPMP). The low-level prison houses up to 24 women inmates who gave birth behind bars and aims to keep mother and child together. For those not so lucky and who do not have family who can step in, a host family is provided. They are put on standby ahead of the birth and wait for a call from prison officials telling them when they are needed. They can then care for the newborn for as little as a couple of weeks to as long as a couple of years, depending how much of the sentence is left to run. Mother-of-three Margaret Bell gave birth behind bars and gave her infant son to a host family from the Babies Out of Bondages Program, a Christian organization run by The Church Of Glad Tidings. The pair were reunited after the 36-year-old was given parole from State Valley and given a room in a church-run house for prison mothers. Melissaa Bates is one of the lucky ones. She and her daughter are serving a two year and seven month sentence together at a community based facility as part of Community Prisoner Mother Program. The Oakwood Community Prisoner Mother Program has just 24 beds for mothers who give birth behind bars . There are only 75 prison beds in the Community Prisoner Mother Program in California . Amanda Krump, an inmate at the Community Prisoner Mother Program,  tries to get her son to sleep for an afternoon nap .

Amber Marich, 25, is seven months pregnant and serving a two year sentence for drugs distribution. Pictured: The expectant mother is visited by a doctor in the run-up to giving birth . Margret Bell, 36,  is reunited with her son Devin.  The Mother-of-three is currently on parole from prison and living at 'The House Of Ruth,' a transitional housing unit for prison mothers and women at risk, run by the Church Of Glad Tidings. Margaret Bell and Son Devin have been reunited after she was released from prison . Amber Marich, 25, who is seven months pregnant  and serving a two-year sentence for distributing drugs, is not the first person in her family to end up behind bars. She also has a uncle serving life, a father who has served multiple prison sentences. Inmates who are pregnant are given little or no rehabilitation for their drug use and criminal lifestyle and it is hard for them once released to escape their past. Prison officials say that children born to criminal parents are also more likely to commit crimes themselves, creating a perpetual cycle that contributes to the growing prison population.

Article text: Opinion has swung to the Left since the last election – but Ed Miliband lacks the credentials to take advantage of it, a major report revealed yesterday. Five years of austerity have pushed the mood further from the Right on issues such as public spending, Europe, welfare and business, it showed. Political attitudes have now returned to the same point as 2005 when Tony Blair secured the last of his three election wins for Labour. But the party still 'struggles to attract support' despite the shift in the public mood, according to detailed analysis of the latest British Social Attitudes Survey. The report shows Labour's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the Conservative Party's ability to portray itself as moderate . It shows that Labour's problems may be the result of a poor reputation for economic competence and leadership and the Conservative Party's ability to portray itself as moderate, said the report. The shift to the Left could also help explain the rise of the Greens and SNP in Scotland, it added. Veteran pollster Peter Kellner said: 'Ed Miliband loses more from a perception that he is not up to the job than he gains from being seen as closer to the centre ground.' The report's author, Dr John Bartle, said the change in attitudes presented a potential danger for the Conservatives if it campaigns hard on issues like benefits and spending cuts. He said: 'The general leftward shift that has taken place since the last general election suggests that arguments about the need to shrink the state, reduce waste and cut income taxes will have less traction than in 2010.' The report's author, Dr John Bartle, said the change in attitudes presented a potential danger for the Conservatives if it campaigns hard on issues like benefits and spending cuts . Veteran pollster Peter Kellner said: 'Ed Miliband loses more from a perception that he is not up to the job than he gains from being seen as closer to the centre ground' The study, carried out by NatCen Social Research and the University of Essex, is based on an analysis of hundreds of opinion polls on a range of issues since 2010. They feed into a wider study which has tracked political attitudes since the mid-1960s. Dr Bartle said the trend since 2010 was typical of that seen in the past – with public opinion moving in the opposite direction to the government of the day. He said: 'Beginning in 1964, the average left-right position generally tracked rightwards until 1980, the year after Margaret Thatcher came to power. 'The public then gradually moved left during the 1980s and remained there for the duration of the [John] Major premiership. 'The mood shifted rightwards from 1997 under New Labour and then left under the Coalition. Consequently, governing parties that achieve their party's preferred policies cut the electoral ground from beneath their own feet – a Conservative government that reduces spending and taxes reduces concerns about waste and regulation, while a Labour government that increases resources to the NHS and education reduces concerns about public services.' SIX weeks ago Labour vowed not to carry out a negative election campaign. Yesterday it unveiled its first poster accusing the Tories of stripping the NHS to the bone. A Tory spokesman described it as ‘fear and smear’ tactics .

Article text: (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu coasted to victory in Tuesday's elections, defying pre-election polls showing his Likud party trailing his main rival, the center-left Zionist Union. Ever the master politician and brilliant tactician, he used the politics of fear to galvanize his right-wing base, which ultimately secured him a fourth term. Israel, however, may not fare as well as its leader did at the polls. In a matter of days, Netanyahu exposed his true attitude toward Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, in the process threatening to further erode an already strained relationship with the White House. Less than two weeks ago, Netanyahu declared that his speech of June 2009 at Bar-Ilan University, where he publicly endorsed a demilitarized Palestinian state, is no longer relevant. On Monday, he continued on this theme, announcing that a Palestinian state would not be established under his watch. These comments were tactical moves aimed at mobilizing his base, but so was his Bar-Ilan speech a maneuver aimed at appeasing U.S. President Barack Obama and quelling criticism from abroad. Ultimately, political expedience led Netanyahu to reveal what many critics had long suspected: He has never supported a two-state solution. In the last six years of his premiership, Netanyahu has spoken out repeatedly against a withdrawal to the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed land swaps -- the basis for a two-state solution; insisted that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people -- a condition no Palestinian leader can accept; and presided over unprecedented settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians regard as their future capital. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister has disparaged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas at every opportunity, asserting that he encourages terrorism -- a claim that was contradicted by the head of Israel's top security service -- and repeating the mantra that Abbas is not a legitimate peace partner. In 2011, he reportedly quashed the Palestinian leader's draft peace agreement that had been secretly negotiated with former Israeli President Shimon Peres. In a less guarded moment, Netanyahu told Israeli writer Etgar Keret that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was "insoluble." Netanyahu's duplicity on the Palestinian issue has led to a highly dysfunctional relationship with the Obama administration, which has tried, in vain, to broker an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. He made a farce of last year's John Kerry-brokered peace talks by increasing settlement work fourfold during this negotiating period. Adding fuel to the fire, Netanyahu has repeatedly injected himself into U.S. politics, most recently with his acceptance of an invitation by House Speaker John Boehner to address Congress -- a move that was widely seen as a partisan ploy to undercut the White House. Obama has yet to respond to Netanyahu's most recent statements, which can only serve to further damage Washington's ties with Jerusalem while contributing to Israel's growing isolation. One European government after another has begun to turn its back on the Israeli government, taking steps to recognize a Palestinian state since it appears less and less likely that one will emerge as a result of negotiations. But criticism of Netanyahu's approach to the Palestinian issue has also come from none other than the Israeli security community, many of whose members are alarmed at Israel's deteriorating position in the international community in general and its schism with Washington in particular. A broad array of former generals, ex-heads of Israel Defense Forces military intelligence, and former chiefs of the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence services have long argued that the status quo is unsustainable and that a two-state solution is vital to Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state. In the last month, nearly 200 of these former high-ranking security officials launched a campaign demanding a change in leadership in light of what they view as Netanyahu's failure to take any diplomatic initiative while harming one of Israel's greatest security assets: its relationship with the United States. Israelis did not heed the ex-security officials' warnings when they voted to retain Netanyahu as their Prime Minister. But while Netanyahu's come-from-behind victory may attest to his shrewd political instincts, it will also come with a high cost for his country.

Article text: Jailed: Munir Hussain, 34, admitted driving while disqualified, dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no insurance . A convicted heroin dealer who led police on a high risk 20-minute chase and then deliberately rammed them has been jailed for almost a year. Munir Hussain, 34, of Brierfield, Lancashire, raced the wrong way down a dual carriageway and around a maze of residential streets as the pursuit was filmed from the sky. It ended when his tyres were punctured by a stinger and he crashed into a police car, sending one officer scrambling for his life. Burnley Crown Court heard that Hussain had been sleeping rough in his Ford Transit van and feared police were about to arrest him for being disqualified and uninsured. Hussain claimed he had been trying to start on a new life away from crime but the incident left him heading back to jail for a ten-month term. The court heard how police in a marked BMW X5 began tailing the van on January 24 - but it sped off, and they turned on their blue lights. Emma Kehoe, prosecuting, said: ‘Such was their concern, the police helicopter was deployed. The vehicle is seen, during the course of the pursuit, travelling onto the wrong side of the carriageway, travelling the wrong way up a dual carriageway at one point and on many narrow residential streets. ‘The vehicle is seen mounting pavements. The speeds vary. At some points the vehicle is travelling slowly, at other times it accelerates to beyond the speed limit. What is consistent throughout is it’s clear from the footage the van is well aware it is being followed by the police. ‘It refuses to stop for 20 minutes and in fact the only way the van is stopped is because a stinger is used. The defendant drove away and crashed into the police car, which was stationary.’ She added: ‘The officer is adamant he felt Mr Hussain’s vehicle was driven at the police vehicle on purpose. It’s clear the officer did feel that was the case as he describes himself as being terrified. ‘He tries to get from the driver’s seat to the passenger side, as the van is coming towards the driver’s side, but is not able to do that because of the speed of the van. ‘It then collides into the door of the police vehicle. He says he suffered whiplash as a result and had to go to the urgent care department.’ Miss Kehoe said when arrested Hussain smelled of alcohol but failed to provide a breath test. On the move: Hussain - who was driving a Ford Transit van (pictured) - raced the wrong way down a dual carriageway and around a maze of residential streets as the pursuit was filmed from the sky . Caught on camera: Police in a BMW began tailing the van but it sped off and they turned on their blue lights . Hussain admitted driving while disqualified, dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no insurance. He was also banned from driving for three years, when he must take an extended driving test. Richard Taylor, defending, said: ‘This offence was borne out of frustration and desperation. 'At the time he had nowhere to live and was sleeping in the back of a car. He had a new relationship with a girlfriend, who is in court and is supportive of him, and was determined to finish his old life of many drugs offences, drink offences and start a new life in Manchester. ‘Unfortunately, his means of doing that was flawed. He used a fairly elderly van and took a considerable risk in going to Manchester.’ Mr Taylor added: ‘He’s going to have to start all over again. He intends, as he has done in the past, to make the most of his time in custody.’ Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘The problem with offences of this nature is that, although, fortunately in this case nobody suffered serious injury, the fact of the matter is when driving of this nature occurs it’s very easy for people to become a victim when they don’t realise there is somebody dangerous coming along the road.’

Susan Hughes, who was born without a uterus, was devastated when she discovered aged just 16 that she would never be able to carry her own children. But big sister Sarah Wheeler promised she would do 'everything in her power' to make Susan a mother. Susan Hughes (left) who was born without a uterus, has become a mother for the first time to baby Dougie (pictured centre with Susan's husband Mike) after her sister Sarah Wheeler (right) agreed to carry her children . And just 15 months ago, Sarah, now 38, gave birth to her nephew Dougie with Susan the first person to hold her newborn son. Susan, 33, and her husband Mike, 36, said they were ecstatic to finally be able to complete their family and would be forever grateful for her sister's precious gift. 'Big sisters are supposed to look after their younger siblings, but mine went above and beyond,' said the new mother, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire.

'I always keep my promises, I had no intention of ever breaking it. It wasn't hard handing him over after the birth, I never thought of Dougie as mine, I was just the oven. We have a special aunty nephew bond though.' Susan was diagnosed with Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser (MRKH) syndrome as a teenager - a condition that affects the reproduction system and meant she didn't have a uterus.

Susan, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, said her sister had gone 'above and beyond' to make her wish of motherhood become true . 'She took my hand and made a pact with me,' explained Susan, an office manager. 'She told me that when they day came and, I wanted children, she would carry them for me.' Eight years ago Susan started dating friend Mike, a mechanic, who knew she couldn't have children. After three years, the couple started to discuss their options and Susan told Mike about her pact with her sister Sarah, a catering assistant. And despite being a proud mother to Megan, 15, Ethan, 11, and Finlay, six, she vowed to stick to her promise without even asking husband Mark, 40, a maintenance man. With no NHS support available, Susan and Mike ploughed £10,000 of savings into fertility treatment.

Article text: (CNN)Families of children killed at the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut have filed lawsuits against the estate of the shooter's mother, saying Nancy Lanza was careless and negligent in leaving a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle unsecured in her home. Adam Lanza, 20, used the assault rifle to kill 20 first-grade students and six adults in Newtown on December 14, 2012. The younger Lanza was mentally unstable and used his mother's Bushmaster to kill her before he went on the rampage at the school, and then killed himself. At least eight lawsuits have been filed in Connecticut courts since January on behalf of relatives of 16 people killed in the massacre -- four adults and 12 children. Court documents also list two people who suffered serious injuries. In December, the parents of nine children killed at the mass shooting, along with one teacher who survived, filed a separate lawsuit against the businesses behind the Bushmaster rifle. Report finds missed chances to help Newtown shooter . The wrongful death lawsuit, filed one day after the second anniversary of the killings, named Camfour, a gun distributor; Riverview Gun Sales;  as well as the Freedom Group, the company that owns Bushmaster. It blamed the numerous lives lost in just 264 seconds on the shooter's weapon of choice, the Bushmaster. Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the law firm for the families in the Bushmaster lawsuit, is also representing some families in the cases against Lanza's estate. The lawsuits were first reported Friday in the Connecticut Post, which said Nancy Lanza is believed to have had insurance on the home worth more than $1 million. "Unlike our case against Bushmaster, Camfour (the distributor), and Riverview for the negligent entrustment and marketing of combat AR-15's designed for the military to inflict mass casualties against the enemy to civilians like Nancy Lanza, we expect this claim to be resolved quickly," attorney Josh Koskoff said of the estate lawsuits. The lawsuits claim that Nancy Lanza kept the rapid-fire Bushmaster in her home "unsecured" and that her "carelessness and negligence" contributed to the pain and suffering of the victims. A look at Newtown in 2013 . One lawsuit accused Lanza of allowing her son access to weapons "despite the fact that she knew, or should have known, that his mental and emotional condition made him a danger to others." The administrator of Nancy Lanza's estate, Samuel Starks, this month asked the courts for an extension to reply and asked that the cases needed to be consolidated. CNN's attempts to reach Starks were unsuccessful.

Article text: (CNN)I am a friendly, hard-working Ohio native. It's how a lot of my friends in New York describe Midwesterners. It's as if we're assembled at "The Flyover Wonder Bread Factory," devoid of color or depth. We supposedly represent all that is wholesome in America. That may be true, but "friendly and hard-working" is so ... bland. If you think I'm being a tad harsh, ask anyone who isn't from the Midwest to describe someone born and raised in America's Heartland. My favorite definition came from a colleague raised in Florida. She struggled to describe us at first, then said, "Simple." Um, like the Amish? "No," she said, flustered. Even my fellow Midwesterners have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors. CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos is a proud native of North Muskegon, Michigan. First thing out of his mouth, "Friendliness!" After that, he struggled, too. "Boy, let me see...um...not easily agitated?" I rolled my eyes. "That is so bland, Danny." He paused, then said, "I'll take bland over the rap Florida gets any day." Even my new friend, Jared Zak, from Wisconsin struggled. The best he could  come up with was "hearty." I asked these questions after interviewing Eric Dayton, who wants his native Minnesota to divorce itself from the Midwest. "We're Midwest if you're looking at it from New York City or from anywhere on [the East] Coast," Dayton told me. "But then again, that's someone else's definition. I think it's time for us to claim our own." Dayton and his brother, Andrew, whose father is the state's governor, are Minneapolis businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor. Eric Dayton, after touring Scandinavia (many Minnesotans are of Norwegian descent), became enthralled by the region's strong identity. It proudly embraced its chilly weather, its food, its culture, its... Northiness. So why, he questioned, didn't Minnesota? When Dayton got home he hired a Minnesota company to make stocking hats for his clothing boutique that said, "North." They sold out and Dayton's idea headed, well, north. Minnesotans just got it, he said. I admit, I didn't get it, until I thought more about it. Minnesota -- or should I say Minneapolis --  is criticized, by some of my compatriots, for being "Minnesota nice," the sort of "nice" (fake) that isn't remotely the kind of "nice" (sincere) for which Midwesterners are renowned. But, hey, I have an open mind. You could argue that Minnesota, along with North Dakota, parts of Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan, are in the Northern region of the United States. And, you could argue Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia are Eastern states. The only truly Midwestern states are Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. Go ahead, argue among yourselves, but know that Mr. Dayton isn't talking only about geography when it comes to labeling Minnesota -- "The North." He's talking about image and, although he won't say it, branding. "The New York Times had done an article highlighting different Thanksgiving side dishes," Dayton told me. "For Minnesota, they named grape salad as our signature side dish. And no one in Minnesota had ever heard of grape salad... it was kind of a harmless example, but if we don't tell the rest of the country who we are, we end up with grape salad." That story got under my skin, especially when I looked up the NYT idea of Ohio's signature side dish: English pea and onion salad. It gets worse. The Times extolled the salad's "deliciousness" by saying it "calls to mind the processed-food delights that, for decades, characterized the cooking of the Midwest." Seriously? The New York Times isn't solely to blame for the Midwest's image problem. Politicians are, too. Andrew Cayton is a distinguished professor of history at Miami University in Ohio. He wrote a book called "The Identity of the American Midwest: Essays on Regional History." "The Midwest," he told me, "has always been a dynamic and diverse place, but that image doesn't fit with what people want to believe." And, by people, Cayton means politicians who routinely use the Midwest as code for a place in time that never actually existed: crime-free and populated with hard-working people who all look and worship the same. "Arguing about the Midwest," Cayton says, "has become arguing about America as a whole." So, listen up, campaigning politicians! Stop trying to bond with the Midwest with your bowling prowess (or lack thereof) and for goodness' sake, stop eating corn dogs at state fairs. And while I'm at it, political reporters, please stop interviewing voters in diners! I'm not maligning bowling (my dad, Tony, is in the Amateur Bowling Hall of Fame) or corn dogs, but those things don't represent the modern Midwest. It is so much more dynamic and, yes, diverse. Chicago is not like Detroit. St. Louis is not like Pittsburgh. Indianapolis is not like Columbus, or Dayton or Cleveland or Cincinnati. And, Minneapolis is not like any of them, either. Minnesota boasts 10,000 lakes and a corresponding love of cold-weather sports, such as pond hockey. Yet, I'm from Canton, Ohio, and I have never touched a hockey stick (although those other "Northern" states certainly have excellent puck-handling abilities). Minneapolis also has a thriving cultural community, is home to 19 Fortune 500 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods. And, at the moment -- it has what many polite Midwesterners can't abide by -- attitude. You know, Minnesota nice. Definition? As my pal from Wisconsin puts it, "sarcastic, pretentious and exclusionary." "I know. Arrogant Minnesota," Dayton joked. "That's what everyone thinks of when they think of Minnesota. Right? No, again, this isn't about being better. It's not a relative thing. It's just I think there are a lot of great things happening in Minnesota. It's not being recognized. I think it's important for the reasons we've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer. And so it's just putting forth our story. It's not trying to make it look better than it is. It's not comparing ourselves to anyone else." I don't know if Dayton will be successful, but I do understand why he wants Minnesota to define Minnesota. You don't attract the best and the brightest with "friendly." "There is a competition for talent," Dayton said. "And it's a national competition, even an international competition." Maybe Ohio should join the rebranding club and become "The East." 'Cause you know what? I may be friendly and hard-working, but I'm not simple. So stop asking me if I've ever gone "cow tipping." Or I just might go all Minnesota on you.

Article text: A cafe owner who took up photography 'as a hobby' has won a top British award for a dramatic storm image. Carla Regler, 31, who runs Seadrift cafe in the little fishing and holiday town of Porthleven with her partner Chris Brooks, used a digital SLR camera to take a stunning picture showing the awesome, furious power of the sea. Her amazing image of Porthleven being battered in last year's ferocious storms has won the weather category in the British Life Photography Awards. Scroll down for video . Carla Regler snapped this shot of Porthleven being battered in last year's ferocious storms , and has won the weather category in the British Life Photography Awards . A beautiful photograph of Porthleven take at Christmas last year, somewhat more serene than the powerful storm shots . Last year she won bronze in the Epson International Pano Awards for a different picture of the same scene, both taken on February 5th, the day that the harbour defences were breached. The Cornwall cafe owner said of her latest award 'This photo was taken at sunrise - the sun is trying to come through and that's what gives it that mood. 'It was a quite an emotional day for Porthleven. It was the day the boats were damaged. 'With everything that happened, it's nice to have been able to capture that moment. 'It's fantastic to get this award and I am really pleased.' The British Life Photography Awards recognises the country's 'obsession' with the weather. On the category section, it states: 'Blessed with four seasons, British weather moulds our landscape, coast, the environment and communities.' And the photos the judges are after are 'Images from parched landscapes to flooded meadows, windswept moors to spring sunlight.' Many households on the coast were left without power after ferocious storms swept in from the Atlantic . Unsurprisingly, all trains lines were suspended in Cornwall at the height of the storm, with structural engineers working overtime . In January and February 2014 hundreds of homes were flooded as the worst storms in 20 years continued to cause misery across the country. Waves as high as 30 feet battered the coastline at Porthleven as Storm Hercules reared its ugly head after moving across the Atlantic over the early part of last year. There were thousands of 999 calls in Cornwall alone, and the Environment Agency issued as many as 340 storm warnings across the country, warning of serious risk to life.' Carla and Chris, 39, moved to Cornwall from Wiltshire four years ago and took on a former wool shop in Porthleven, converting it into the seaside cafe of their dreams. But while Chris is the chef, Carla has become so successful at photography that they have turned the upstairs into a gallery to show off her work. Six months ago she was approached to do pictures for a lifestyle company, and she now also runs photography courses, which is amazing considering she has never had any lessons herself and is completely self-taught. Waves reached as high as 30 feet on the Porthleven coastline as Storm Hercules battered Britain in the early part of 2014 . She has two Canon digital SLR cameras, one costing £1,000, the other £4,000 which she used for the award-winning images. 'I tend to stick to landscape and seascape pictures, and I also like taking photos of horses' she said. 'Obviously the scenery along this coast is beautiful and dramatic so you can get some great pictures, in all types of lights and colours depending on the weather. 'The storms were something else - the town took a proper pounding and they are only just finishing repairs to the harbour wall. 'In fact we got swamped in two ways - the harbour area was battered and flooded, then we had loads of tourists coming down to take pictures of it all!'

Article text: Lord Mandelson feared he would have to break in to 10 Downing Street after civil servants told him it would be inappropriate for him to be seen entering the front door after the last Election. Gus O'Donnell, the then Cabinet Secretary, told the Labour peer it would be wrong for senior Labour aides to been seen entering No10 while talks were still ongoing about which political party would form the next Government. This is one of the explosive scenes from a political drama that sheds new light on the historic negotiations which led to the creation of the Coalition Government, having been based on interviews with key figures in the talks including George Osborne, Lord Ashdown, Gus O'Donnell and Lord Mandelson. No joke: Mark Gatiss plays Lord Mandelson in the drama 'Coalition' - it airs on Channel 4 on Saturday . Explosive: A scene from the political drama that sheds new light on the historic negotiations which led to the creation of the Coalition Government . In one scene Gordon Brown, who is still Britain's Prime Minister even though he does not have an overall majority, heads off to No10, joking: 'Before they lock us out.' But a furious O'Donnell tries to divert the PM's entourage of cars when he receives a call telling him they are almost at the gates.He tells Mandelson: 'Peter, just wait a minute. This is the seat of Government. You are not the Government. You can't use Downing Street for party political purposes.' A furious Mandelson, played by Mark Gatiss, says: 'F***ing civil servants. We are going to have to break in.' O'Donnell is forced, however, to allow the PM through the gates when Mandelson reminds him that Brown is 'actually and not just technically' the Prime Minister. But the peer and other senior party aides were forced to enter No10 through the back door of the Cabinet Office – and then found that all their computer passwords had been changed. Coalition is on Channel 4 on Saturday at 9pm.

Article text: A bogus doctor who had 'more psychiatric qualifications than Sigmund Freud' and used her husband and parents as fake references has been unmasked as a serial liar. Sarah Sims claimed she had a long list of qualifications from the University of London and said she had been given a 'ladyship' by Warwick University. The three-times married 'doctor' also claimed she had been an officer in the Ministry of Defence as she applied to be head of childcare services at a children's home in Folkestone, Kent. But she was finally exposed as a fraud after the employers discovered her qualifications were completely made up. Sarah Sims claimed she had been given a doctorate by the University of London (pictured), but it just was one of a long list of lies she told . Sims, 41, claimed on her CV that she received a first class bachelor's degree, master's degree and philosophy doctorate from the University of London. She said her last job had been lead welfare officer at the MoD, and included glowing testimonial from her line manager Sergeant Major Darren Pugh. Three-times married Sims, who lives in a £1million home near Canterbury, also claimed to be a member of the 'British Association of Counselling and Psychology (BCAP).' She added that she had been awarded the title of 'Ladyship' from Warwick University for community 'good works'. The highly-qualified 'doctor' seemed the perfect fit for the role as operations director at Ferndearle Child Care Services - until it was revealed that nearly her entire CV was a lie. A jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard that Sims did not receive any of the psychology degrees she claimed to own, and her university had no record of her ever being a student there. Warwick University said it never gives out the title of 'ladyship' and the British Association of Counselling and Psychology does not exist. Sims' glowing reference from her 'line manager' Sergeant Major Darren Pugh turned out be be her 48-year-old husband - Darren Pugh - who was himself cleared of fraud. The three-times married 'doctor' also claimed she had been an officer in the Ministry of Defence as she applied to be head of child care services at a nursing home, Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) heard . The court also heard that two other references listed on Sims' CV as 'therapeutic supervisors' were actually her parents. Piers Reed, prosecuting, told how Sims applied for the Folkestone post in February 2011, saying she was considering leaving the Army. Mr Reed said: 'She said she was a doctor of psychology and was interested in working for Fearndale. She contacted the manager and part-owner of the home and arranged to visit.' 'Mr Pugh had been in the Army, but not at that time. In her job application, she stated she had been a student at London University and had obtained a BA in Psychology, an MA and Phd in Behavioural Psychology. 'Under the heading, she said she was a member of BCAP and, under the Awards heading, stated that, in May 1997, she had been awarded a ladyship from Warwick University for services to the community.' But Mr Reed said that said Sims appeared to have 'more psychiatric qualifications than Sigmund Freud', but there were no records of her attending university. Mr Reed added: 'BCAP doesn't exist. The British Psychological Society and the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy do exist, but neither have ever heard of her. 'And the University of Warwick, while conferring awards, never confer titles such as 'Ladyship'. 'In her CV, she also claimed to have worked as a lead consultant director for a company called EIS. There are no records of her ever working for EIS.' Mr Reed told the court that Sims obtained a mortgage on her property after telling Halifax she was earning between £80,000 and £150,000. In fact, at the time, she was jobless. Sims was found guilty of four counts of fraud and will be sentenced next month.

Article text: A two-year-old polar bear named Pixel has arrived at a wildlife park in Yorkshire to join England's only other polar bear. Victor, a 16-year-old, half-tonne bear who has lived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster since August has now been joined by younger male Pixel. The park said Pixel is 14 years younger and a third of the size of his new compound-mate. Pixel (pictured) a two-year-old polar bear from a zoo just outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands has arrived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster, where he joins resident 16-year-old polar bear Victor . On Monday, Pixel was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull . Once Pixel is settled the park plans to introduce him to Victor as soon as possible . Pixel soon made himself at home in his enclosure and immediately began exploring his new surroundings . 'Male polar bears will leave their mothers at approximately two years old,' said Animal Development Manager Simon Marsh. 'This means it is quite natural for Pixel to wander and find other males to hang around with. 'Pixel is very playful and finds everything interesting and will be sure to keep Victor and the visitors entertained.' The park said Pixel, who may one day be part of the European Breeding Programme, was brought to YWP from a zoo outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands in an operation this week. Pixel arrived at the park yesterday morning (pictured) before being released in the polar enclosure . Polar bears are a species that are increasingly being threatened in their native habitat . On Monday he was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull, arriving at the South Yorkshire park on yesterday morning. Mr Marsh said Victor, who weighs 480kg, gave a roar when he realised there was an new arrival at Project Polar, the park's purpose-built 10 acre polar bear reserve. He said: 'Victor was immediately on his guard when he realised another polar bear was there. But after a roar or two he settled down. Once released in the enclosure Pixel immediately took a dip following his long journey from the Netherlands . To his obvious delight the polar bear caught a fish in the large pond within his enclosure . 'Once Pixel is settled in the plan will be to introduce them together as soon as possible. Pixel is going to look so small compared to big old Victor.' Mr Marsh added: 'Polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause. 'Their native sea ice is disappearing due to climate change but we still have a chance to do something about it and at Project Polar we can share with visitors how they can help. 'It is also vital that we understand how to care for these bears appropriately in captivity and provide for their needs. 'The initial research into Victor has been extremely encouraging and Pixel's arrival is a bonus.' Pixel appears very pleased with himself as he returns his catch to the bank before eating it . Pixel is the newest arrival at Project Polar, the park's purpose-built 10 acre polar bear reserve .

Article text: A snake catcher has shared hilarious images of some of the most bizarre places he has discovered the world's deadliest creatures. For 13 years Richie Gilbert has been removing serpents from unexpected spots such as gyms, wine racks, brothels and even under pillows. Fearless Mr Gilbert has relocated around 600 snakes across Queensland, Australia, since founding his company Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, which operates 24 hours and seven days a week, in February 2014. Scroll down for video . Snake catcher Richie Gilbert has relocated around 600 snakes across Queensland, Australia, since founding his company Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 . The brave father-of -two has shared some of the hilarious places he's removed snakes from: A red-bellied black snake made itself at home in a child's shoe (left) and an eastern brown snake waits in a bird feeder patiently for lunch (right) A carpet python guards the toilet paper: Mr Gilbert has been bitten more than 100 bites in his lifetime . He has been bitten more than a dozen times this past season alone - with more than 100 bites in his lifetime. But despite his daring job, Mr Gilbert anticipates turning it into a family business with his five-year-old daughter, Ivory, showing an interest. 'My family have a healthy respect for venomous snakes and while they wouldn't touch them, they certainly do not fear them,' he said. 'My two eldest girls, Zahra and Ivory, absolutely love hearing about my day and will hold non-venomous snakes any chance they get.' A red-bellied black snake curled up under a pillow: Mr Gilbert anticipates turning it into a family business . A 1.5m python loose in Richies car (left) and a 2.7m long coastal carpet python lifting some weights (right) A 1.6m carpet python made itself at home near a toilet: Mr Gilbert caught his first snake at five years old . Mr Gilbert deals with creatures varying from carpet snakes to highly venomous Eastern Brown Snakes, the second-most venomous in the world. He added: 'My mum says I was chasing lizards as soon as I could walk. 'She tells people I caught my first snake, a highly-venomous copperhead, when I was five. 'We were camping in New South Wales and a friend and I came out of the bush with it in a bucket. A snake cuddled up on a wine rack: 'Most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that couldn't be further from the truth,' Mr Gilbert said . A large python helps out in the office (left) and a carpet python pictured coming through a door after chasing a cat (right) Knock, knock: A carpet python waits outside a door . 'Most people think a snake will chase you and bite but that couldn't be further from the truth. 'They also think they are slimy but they really just feel like finger nails.' But that close encounter with disaster didn't deter the boy from the Sunshine Coast from turning his backyard hobby  into a career as a qualified snake catcher. 'A lot of people think it's a dangerous job but to me, I feel like it's not dangerous at all,' Mr Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Gilbert was called to a home this season where he found the large carpet python had devoured chickens . 'There are people risking their lives everyday - like electricians or people parachuting and jumping out of planes - to me that's dangerous but its all relative to risk management. 'But I've been doing it for a long time and I can't put my finger on what attracted me to them but I have always loved chasing snakes since I was little. 'And I love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when I catch them.' Mr Gilbert, who owns the Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7, has been catching snakes since the age of five . Gilbert's colleague Stuart McKenzie recently removed an eastern brown snake on a job. Mr Gilbert added: 'It's the most beautiful one I've ever seen - it's orange incase you didn't notice!' 'It's been quite busy during the summer season and I've been getting a lot of phone calls and text messages for identification or to attend homes to locate and remove snakes if necessary', he said. Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training. 'A lot of people ask me how I've learnt to catch snakes but I can't remember a day where I'm not catching them – I've been doing it for a long time and I guess it was just self-taught. 'Growing up, Steve Irwin played a passion that I had. I remember watching his shows and thinking 'that's what I do too!' and it stirred me on from there.' He was called to this home in the Sunshine Coast to save a pet cat from this python which was waiting to pounce . Mr Gilbert has been quite busy during the summer season, with number phone calls and texts daily . Snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the Sunshine Coast . While Mr Gilbert makes his job sound too easy, he said he has had some of the scariest moments. 'Just recently, I did something really stupid – I crawled underneath a home and it was just two foot off the ground to catch an eastern brown snake. 'Crawling on my tummy, trying to locate it which in hind sight – I shouldn't have done – but when I looked up, it was right above my head, looking at me like 'what are you doing?' so I slowly backed out. 'The owner passed me a pool stick to try and get it out and it dropped to the ground just two metres from my face and looked straight at me in a defence position – it's what they do when they feel threatened and vulnerable. Despite many years of experience, Mr Gilbert said he has never had any training and was self-taught . The family Labrador alerted the owners when it found a carpet python in its kennel. The owners taped up the door to trap it inside the kennel until Mr Gilbert arrived to remove it . 'It was stupid and dumb – I managed to catch it safely but it wasn't the end of it. The owner's Labrador was coming at me so I had the snake in one hand and trying to scare the dog with my leg – it was crazy.' After Mr Gilbert catches the reptiles, he releases them back into the wild. 'We try to release them in the same geographical area and I don't like to take them too far away from where they were found. But it has to be a far distance away so they don't come back,' he said. 'But if it's a venomous snake, a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas.' When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance . The avid snake catcher has been catching snakes at a very young age and hasn't stopped since . Mr Gilbert said the most venomous snakes Australians should be aware of at the moment is the eastern brown snakes, which are the second most venomous snakes in the world. When it doubt about spotting a snake, Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance. 'Send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it's venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them,' he said. 'If the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms, it's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us. 'Be smart about it because 90 percent of the time, people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away. 'All snakes want to do is get away but if it doesn't feel it can escape, it'll strike – so be sensible when you spot them.' For more information, please visit Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7. Snakes are a common component of backyard fauna. But these key points will help you take precautions around the home to reduce the likelihood of a negative encounter. Source: Snake Catcher Brisbane .

Article text: Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in northern Syria have mysteriously released 19 Christians hostages, local activists have revealed. The members of Christian Assyrian community were among 220 people kidnapped by jihadis from a string of villages along the Khabur River in Hassakeh province last week. The terrorists gave no explanation for why they had chosen to free the 19 men and three women, who were packed on a bus in the ISIS-held town of Shaddadeh, and arrived safely  at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the nearby city of Hassakeh yesterday afternoon. The news provided a modicum of relief to a Christian Assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions. But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive. The unexplained release is reminiscent of ISIS' freeing of 200 elderly  Yazidi community members near Kirkuk in Iraq in January, which came after the hostages had been held for several months. Free: Members of Christian Assyrian community embrace their relatives after being released by ISIS . Safe: 19 men and three women were packed on a bus in the ISIS-held town of Shaddadeh and arrived safely at the Church of the Virgin Mary in the nearby city of Hassakeh yesterday afternoon . Release at last: News of the release provided a modicum of relief to a Christian Assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions. But fears remain over the fate of the hundreds still held captive . Captured: The Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians and later published these photographs on its Facebook page . It is not immediately clear why the Islamic State group freed these captives but not more than 200 others . Both Bashir Saedi, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization, and the Assyrian Human Rights Network reported the release of the 19 Christians. The later published photographs on its Facebook page that it said were taken in Hassakeh and appeared to show a crowd of people dressed in winter coats greeting the returnees. The photos appeared genuine, according to the Associated Press news agency. It was not immediately clear why the Islamic State group freed these captives. Saedi said all those released were around 50 years of age or older, which suggests age might have been a factor. Bashir Saedi, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization, said all those released were around 50 years of age or older, which suggests age might have been a factor . The Assyrian Human Rights Network, meanwhile, said the captives had been ordered released by a Shariah court after paying an unspecified amount of money levied as a tax on non-Muslims . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said a Shariah court had ruled the captives be freed, but the reasoning behind the decision was unknown . Similar: The unexplained release is reminiscent of ISIS' freeing of 200 elderly Yazidi community members near Kirkuk in Iraq in January (pictured), which came after the hostages had been held for several months . The Assyrian Human Rights Network, meanwhile, said the captives had been ordered released by a Shariah court after paying an unspecified amount of money levied as a tax on non-Muslims. Known as a jizya, the tax effectively forces Jew and Christians - so-called 'People of the Book' - to either pay a regular sum of protection money to the jihadis, or otherwise choose between forced conversion to Islam or brutal execution. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said a Shariah court had ruled the captives be freed, but the reasoning behind the decision was unknown. The fate of the more than 200 other Christian Assyrians still in ISIS' hands remains unclear. Prayers: An Assyrian Christian woman attends a mass in the Syrian capital Damascus yesterday in solidarity with the 220 people kidnapped from a string of villages along the Khabur River in Hassakeh last week . Service: Assyrian Christians attend a mass in solidarity with the people kidnapped last week . Displaced Assyrian women, who fled their homes due to ISIS attacks, take part in prayers at the Ibrahim al-Khalil Melkite Greek Catholic church in the Jaramana district on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus . Most of those kidnapped are believed to have been taken by fighters to Shaddadeh, located 30 miles south of Hassakeh. Assyrian leaders and Sunni tribal sheikhs have begun reaching out to ISIS to try to negotiate the release of the captives, activists said. 'We're trying to contact any party that might help. We're working through our friends the tribal sheikhs,' said Younan Talia, a senior official in the Assyrian Democratic Organization. 'Some friends of Daesh are trying to send messages.' Talia said there has been no response yet. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. Diminished: Some 30,000 Assyrian Christians lived in Syria before the start of the civil war in 2011 . Future: Syria's embattled Assyrian Christian community is one the world's oldest Christian groups . The Sweden-based director of the Assyrian Network for Human Rights in Syria, Osama Edward, also said efforts were underway to try to negotiate the captives' release. The abductions have added to fears among religious minorities in both Syria and Iraq, who have been repeatedly targeted by the Islamic State group. During the militants' bloody campaign in both countries, where they have declared a self-styled caliphate, minorities have been repeatedly targeted and killed, driven from their homes, had their women enslaved and places of worship destroyed. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have released sickening footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy. The video was filmed in  Aleppo and shows a man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range. In a chilling sign of ISIS' reach and influence, Muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based in neighbouring NATO member state Turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in Syria. Brutal: A man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad was seen being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range . Murder: A militant shoots Ahmed Muhammad once in the back of the head, before standing over him and firing several more bullets into his neck once he lies prone on the grass . Titled 'A Lesson To Be Learned', the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official ISIS release - employing HD cameras, Hollywood-style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction. The sickening film is reminiscent of the gruesome video showing the burning to death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, in that it begins with a lengthy interview with the orange-jumpsuit wearing victim speaking while sat at a table in a darkened room. Muhammad is seen giving details of the charges against him, which are understood to relate to accusations he was working as part of a spy network over the border in southern Turkey. Led to his death: Once the Arabic-language interview scene inside the building is completed, Muhammad is then seen walking in a hunched position across a courtyard .

Article text: (CNN)Christopher Nowak says none of his friends were surprised when he and his wife decided to use a down payment for a home on a monorail car instead. After all, this was no ordinary monorail car, and Nowak is not your average collector. This was the front cab of an original monorail train that transported millions of visitors throughout Walt Disney World in the 1970s and 1980s. The original Mark IV monorail trains were retired in 1989 to make room for a new generation of models, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Nowak and his wife are Disney fanatics who honeymooned at Disney World and once visited all the Disney parks in the world (minus Paris) in a month. He's also a self-described artist, inventor and collector of "weird old vehicles," including an articulated bus he claims to have transformed into a mobile nightclub. The couple from Chico, California, purchased the cab in 2014, dreaming of the day they might use it to drive their kids to school or bring it to the annual Burning Man festival (Nowak declined to say what he paid for the rail car.) But plans change. Nowak listed the item last week on eBay for $260,000 with a starting bid of $169,000. More than 1,500 people were watching the auction as of Saturday night, though no one had bid. The listing itself was pulled from eBay on Sunday. Nowak, who owns a sound and lighting custom stage design company, had told CNN he and his wife needed the money to fund their next big project, but he declined to provide details. "My wife and I had plans for it, but we're kind of strapped for cash, so we figured, let's put it out and see what happens." The listing provided some insight into what Nowak might have had in mind for the cab. "Some people have train cars in their back yard, imagine your own monorail guest room, or man cave. Mount it on a bus chassis and drive it around!! Turn it into your kids' ultimate clubhouse," the description on the eBay page read. "This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to own a very serious piece of Disney history." The listing said the vehicle is available for viewing in Tampa, where Nowak left it with a friend after buying it from a seller in Georgia via eBay last year.

Article text: A chip-in on his final hole handed Brian Davis a one-shot lead after the opening round of the Valspar Championship in Florida. The Englishman recorded eight birdies and two bogeys in an opening 65 to sit six under, a shot clear of American pair Sean O'Hair and Ricky Barnes. Starting on the back nine, Davis birdied 11,12, 14, 15 and 18 to turn in 30 and two further birdies on five and six had him out in the lead on his own. Brian Davis leads the Valspar Championship in Florida after an opening round including eight birdies . Bogeys on the seventh and eighth followed to stall his momentum somewhat but a wedge from the greenside rough at nine saw him take top spot. 'I actually hit a really good tee shot and a really good second shot, I was surprised to see it there,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'Obviously it's into the green so I can be aggressive but it actually jumps out a bit quicker than I thought and obviously (I am) delighted it hit the pin and dropped in. 'Delighted with the round, I hit some really good shots today.' Davis has won 12.8million dollars in his PGA Tour career but has yet to win a tournament and hopes improved iron play may at last push him over the edge after hitting 15 greens in regulation on the Copperhead course. 'My stats probably show I'm hitting eight to 10 greens a round, which is not going to get it done,' he added. 'If you start hitting 14 greens the way I putt, you're going to shoot under par and that's what I did today.' Davis hopes that his improved form will lead to a first tournament win of his PGA Tour career . O'Hair had eight birdies and three bogeys in his 66 while Barnes recorded a single dropped shot on 17 to slip into a share of second. There was then a group of six players on four under made up of Justin Thomas, Derek Ernst, Nicholas Thompson, Brendon de Jonge, Alex Cejka and Henrik Stenson. World number three Stenson is the highest ranked player in the field with Rory McIlroy and Bubba Watson not present and his 67 was bogey free. The Swede, starting on 10, had chances for birdie on his opening five holes but could only take advantage on 11, 13 and 14 before picking up a shot on nine. And Stenson hopes this week will provide him with some good practice for the Masters in four weeks' time. Henrik Stenson, the top-ranked player in the tournament, is two shots back after a first round of 67 . 'I come in here trying to prepare for Augusta as well and this is a great test for that,' he told www.pgatour.com. 'To just keep hitting your spots and stay patient and I did that all day and I got rewarded for it. 'I'm going to try the same for the next three days and, of course, try and hit the shots. Even though my swing wasn't on today I still picked my targets and tried the best I could. 'I hit some good shots, obviously, and the other ones I missed in the right places which is key here.' Ian Poulter was in a large group of players at three under while Scottish pair Russell Knox and Martin Laird were a further shot back.

The former Manchester City boss was responding to this weekend's call ups of Sampdoria's Brazilian-born striker Eder and Palermo's Argentine-born midfielder Franco Vazquez to Italy's squad. Vazquez's mother is Italian while Eder gained citizenship through more distant relatives. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini thinks that players not born in Italy shouldn't represent the national team . Speaking at a Serie A meeting Monday, Mancini said:, 'The Italian national team should be Italian. 'An Italian player deserves to play for the national team while someone who wasn't born in Italy, even if they have relatives, I don't think they deserve to.' Dozens of foreign-born players - mainly Brazilians and Argentines - have appeared for Italy over the years, highlighted by Omar Sivori and Jose Altafini in the 1960's and Omar Camoranesi during the Azzurri's 2006 World Cup victory. Franco Vasquez of Palermo is eligible to play for the national side because his mother was born in Italy .

Article text: Joy for pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton but ignominy for Jenson Button and history-making of the wrong sort for McLaren. Both their cars, Button in one, Kevin Magnussen in the other, will be on the back row of the grid for the Australian Grand Prix. Their participation ended with the doom-laden radio transmission to Button, a three-time winner here at Albert Park: ‘We have leapfrogged Magnussen, but unfortunately we are one-tenth short of Ericsson (of Sauber) and out.’ In the McLaren garage, chairman Ron Dennis watched on, wearing headphones, his neck extended, his face impassive. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his pole lap as he waves to the crowd at the Albert Park Circuit. He qualified ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg and Williams driver Felipe Massa . Lewis Hamilton gives his thumbs up to the crowd after sticking his Mercedes on pole in Melbourne . Lewis Hamilton was fastest in qualifying and will start on pole for tomorrow's Australian Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton celebrates his brilliant pole . 1. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:26.327 . 2.

McLaren were six seconds off Mercedes, who took pole through a lightning quick Hamilton, virtually six-tenths – a.k.a. an age – ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg. Felipe Massa, of Williams, was third. It has been estimated that McLaren could be 250 brake horsepower (the equivalent of the Honda Civic Type R) short of the Mercedes. So much for McLaren's new partnership with Honda. So much for the rebuilding that was promised when Dennis sacked Martin Whitmarsh as team principal to take on the chief executive’s role himself. Dennis has inched ever more involved in the team, having originally promised to detach himself and leave the day-to-day management to Eric Boullier, the sporting director. The formula is not working even at their annual outlay of a mighty £200million. Jenson Button will start Sunday's Australian Grand Prix from 17th after a miserable qualifying session . Button leaves the pit-lane with his McLaren team well off the pace at the first race of the season . McLaren will start from the very back of the pack; they were some six seconds slower than the Mercedes . Re-live every moment of an incident-packed qualifying session in Melbourne . You have to wonder whether Fernando Alonso, who is missing this race after being concussed in a testing accident last month, will want to return for Malaysia a fortnight hence. A sick note from the doctor might suit him nicely. Until, let’s say, Monza. By that race in September, Mercedes may nearly, or actually, have wrapped up the constructors’ title. Their dominance is so immense that Hamilton was 1.4sec ahead of Massa’s Williams. Hamilton, securing his fourth pole on the track where he made his debut eight years ago, said: ‘It has been a great start to the weekend. It does not feel like a long time since the last race. 'It has been a huge effort by the guys back at the factory so I feel incredibly blessed. It is so much fun in qualifying and I am massively grateful for all the hard work of the team.' Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, on his Ferrari debut, qualified fourth in Melbourne . Nico Hulkenberg, in his Force India, takes a trip across the gravel. He will start 14th tomorrow . Hamilton ran wide on his very first lap of the afternoon, but recovered to secure pole in Melbourne . Hamilton, who started on pole  here in Melbourne in 2014, but retired with an engine problem, added: 'We had a difficult start to the season last year, so we a really hoping for a better start for both cars to succeed tomorrow. We are going to work as hard as we can, and it will be a good fight with Nico.' Rosberg had to abort his first flying lap after running wide, but recovered to complete a Mercedes front-row lockout. He said: 'The story was Lewis was in impressive form and he did an awesome job. 'For me, the speed was there but I did not get it together. I am realy thankfulf for the team and the car they have given me. P2, I will live with for now, but it is a long day tomorrow.' Of the dominant Mercedes pair, third-placed Massa said: 'They are in a different category'. An ariel view of the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne which plays hosts to the season-opening race . Massa finished third in qualifying and claimed Mercedes are 'in a different category' McLaren would not have been at the very back had Manor not sat qualifying out. The team will not race either. Their supposed rebirth from the ashes of Marussia is danger of turning into a bad joke. Button, however, believes this year's McLaren is essentially good, saying: ‘I was always thinking long term when I re-signed. I really do think that in the end we can challenge Mercedes at the front. This a new package, not just in terms of the engine but the philosophy behind it, the aerodynamics and airflow. ‘I’d rather not be at the back of the grid, but I am not sitting here downbeat. It is a tough time now and there will be tough times for many weeks, but it will make us stronger. ‘We have not done a race distance yet. So if we finish the race tomorrow it may not sound much, but it will help a lot.’ Max Verstappen, the youngest qualifier in Formula One history at 17 years and 165 days, qualified 12th. He had ‘a big moment’ squirming wide at turn five and that left him four places behind Toro Rosso team-mate Carlos Sainz Jnr. Red Bull were disappointingly slow, with Daniil Kvyat only 13th and Daniel Ricciardo seventh. Sparks fly from the bottom of Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso... the 17-year-old will start 12th on Sunday .

Article text: In-flight meals can be unappetising at the best of times so it’s always a good idea to bring along some snacks if you are going to be in the air for a while. The problem is, when you’re confined to a little seat on a fighter jet hurtling through the clouds at the speed of sound and the pilot is holding a chocolate bar, just how can you get your hands on it? Well a pilot and his navigator found the perfect way without having to take their eyes off the sky, and captured the moment on camera. The pilots appear to be part of the US Navy, judging by their helmets, but little is known about the origin of the video. The pilot lets go of the chocolate bar to allow the gravitational pull to transport it to his navigator . Holding a Snickers chocolate bar in his hand, the pilot lets go and allows the gravitational force to do the rest. Waiting with an outstretched arm, as the chocolate bar floats behind the pilot, the navigator reaches out and after a little bit of scrabbling manages to catch it in his hands. Throwing it back up in the air before catching it again the navigator waves the bar around in celebration and the pilot gives him the thumbs up in approval. Floating in the air, the chocolate begins its journey towards the navigator who waits with an outstretched hand . On its way: The navigator scrambles for the chocolate bar as it floats towards him and manages to catch it . The fact that it was uploaded to an empty Youtube account however has brought about speculation that the video is a commercial for Snickers. But it may just be a way for the two pilots to keep their identity a mystery while having some fun. Weightlessnes like this occurs when there are no external objects touching the chocolate bar and exerting a push or pull upon it. When in a state of free fall like the pilots, the only force acting upon the snack is gravity – a non-contact force. And since gravity cannot be felt without any other opposing forces, there is no sensation of it present. Success: After catching the chocolate bar the navigator celebrates and the pilot gives him the thumbs up .

Ground truth Summary: The Snickers bar is released by the pilot and floats behind him .

Article text: Claire Allnutt died in hospital after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days. Her family are now taking action against the NHS trust involved, which, they claim, only gave staff 20 minutes training in a new system of patient monitoring . Medics who treated a young woman who died after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days had just 20 minutes training in a monitoring system, it has been claimed. Claire Allnutt was recovering from having the flesh-eating bug necrotising fasciitis at Luton and Dunstable Hospital last year when the contaminated catheter was used to administer antibiotics. Her devastated parents, Ann and Richard, are now taking action against the NHS trust involved and are claiming staff may have had just 20 minutes training on a new system of monitoring patients. Ms Alnutt's family have also reported five medics from the hospital to the, the General Medical Council watchdog, claiming a catalogue of errors led to their daughter's death. Claire, 28, has been suffering from the flesh-eating infection but was making a full recovery after two months in hospital. But she died from septicaemia when a drip administering antibiotics was left in her arm for four days, triggering blood poisoning. It later emerged that the hospital was using a new electronic alert system called National Early Warning Score. It showed that Claire's condition was deteriorating but staff appear not to have acted on the alert. Her family lodged Freedom of Information request and found staff may have only had 20 minutes training on the system. They have instructed lawyers specialising in medical negligence cases to take action against the hospital. Carole Watts of firm Ashton KCJ said: 'On the face of it this seems to be a very short period of training, especially as the electronic warning system deals with life and death situations. 'It's of great concern to Claire's parents that the staff using the electronic system may not have been adequately trained to use it. 'They are devastated by the loss of their daughter and it's important for them to know that lessons have been learnt from their tragic loss.' An inquest last year heard how a junior doctor spotted fungal spores in the tube on a Friday but it wasn't removed until the following Tuesday. Observation notes showed Claire's condition worsened over the weekend but medics decided to just monitor her and no action was taken until the Tuesday. By that time, life-threatening sepsis had set in and she suffered several heart attacks before dying in the early hours of the following morning. Claire, from Luton, Bedforshire, who was obese and had learning difficulties, had initially refused to consent to the tube being withdrawn because of a phobia of needles. Ms Allnutt's family have also reported five members of staff at the hospital to the General Medical Council . Her family have questioned why no action was taken to remove the drip, known as a PICC line. Ms Watts added: 'The family have many questions about the circumstances of Claire's death and why no action was taken to remove the PICC line. 'It's hoped that the GMC complaint will ensure the actions of the doctors around the time of Claire's death are fully investigated and that the family are given the answers that they need. 'Claire's parents are determined to fight for justice for Claire and a civil claim is being pursued against the hospital.' A hospital spokesman said: 'The Luton and Dunstable University Hospital has given an unreserved apology to Claire Allnutt's family following her tragic death last January. 'All staff groups involved in Claire's case have reflected and learned from the events that occurred prior to Claire's death, and this has resulted in a number of changes to practice, which are being constantly monitored and evaluated.' Hospital bosses say they have apologised unreservedly to Ms Allnutt's family and have made changes .

Article text: Swatch, the world's . largest watchmaker unveiled its riposte to Apple's smartwatch. It plans to put cheap . programmable chips in watches that will let wearers from China . to Chicago make payments with a swipe of the wrist. Swatch Group will start offering watches with near . field communication (NFC) chips within two months, said at a news conference on the company's . annual results which were released last month. Scroll down for video . We're coming for you Apple! Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek said Apple's launch was a 'fantastic opportunity' for the Swiss watchmaker. The rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula. Andrew Sheehy, chief analyst at Generator Research, sees the retail value of wearable Internet-connected devices at $93.1 billion by 2018, versus $4.1 billion in 2014, with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market's value in 2018. Apple's move into watches would open up a market where . Swatch was already well positioned to compete, he said. The Swiss company's strategy appears to revolve around . including individual tech features in different models rather . than going head to head with Apple, the world's most valuable . firm, to create all-in-one smartwatches combining many . functions. 'We are the world champions of integrating smart functions . into a watch,' Hayek said. 'We don't want to produce a mini . mobile phone on your wrist. Others can do that.' At 1600 GMT, Swatch shares were up 2.7 percent at 432.1 . Swiss francs. Apple's watch will go on sale in nine countries starting in . April, priced from $349 for the smaller model and $549 for the . standard version, although a high-end 'Edition' watch will sell . for at least $10,000. 'It's a fantastic opportunity for us. It is opening the . market. 'Especially in the U.S., many people are not wearing . watches any more. Somebody is opening this up. Let Apple do the . work. It's fine. It's good. I congratulate them.' The new connected watch 'Swatch Touch Zero One'which will go on sale within months . Both firms' strategies could co-exist and succeed, Hayek . said, before adding a dig at the bigger rival: 'Upgrading . software every year, that's not our business.' For its near-field chips, which will cost around 2 francs . ($2) per watch, Swatch has teamed up with China UnionPay, the . Chinese credit card association, as well as a Swiss bank and a . major credit card company. The credit card company, described as an Olympics sponsor, . is likely to be Visa, a long-time backer of the event. Visa was not immediately available to comment. Swatch is also launching a range of sports-themed 'Swatch . Touch' smartwatches which will be able to 'buddy up' with a . smartphone via a Bluetooth connection. The first model will retail at 135 francs, about twice the . cost of a regular Swatch watch with an NFC chip.

Article text: An aspiring singer who made it to boot camp on X Factor has become the first short-haired finalist in the Miss England pageant. Jade McQueen bagged first place in her regional competition when she beat off long-locked competitors to take home the title of Miss Surrey. And now the 24-year-old wants to demonstrate to other young women that you don't have to be 'perfect' to win a pageant. Jade McQueen is the first dark-short-haired contestant to earn a place in the Miss England finals . Jade wowed the judges at the regional contest, her first ever pageant, in a dark blue satin dress as a she shared the tale of how she delivered her sister younger sister in her family's front room. Before Jade earned her place in the Miss England final there had only ever been one other shorter-haired competitor, but even she had a traditional look. Jade says: 'There was a short-haired contestant in 2009 with blonde hair but hers was shoulder length and that was considered short. Mine is cropped so is much shorter.' Jade says that for her winning was especially important after the short-haired Miss Jamaica lost out to the long haired Miss Columbia at last year's Miss Universe final. Jade took home the crown at the Miss Surrey finals which was her first ever beauty pageant . Jade wants to demonstrate to other potential contestants that you don't have to conform to win . 'Everyone was so shocked that short hair would get in the way of winning. So I am pleased that more short-haired women are being recognised in beauty pageants now. 'I want to prove that long hair isn't the only beautiful hairstyle.' Jade, who works as a coordinator receptionist has a history of charity work which she says helped her find her way into beauty pageants. 'I'm really into charity work and I wanted to expand that so pageanting was the perfect fit. It was Jade's love of charity work that helped her find her way into pageanting, she now works with Beauty with a Purpose, a Miss World charity . 'It was researching pageanting online that I found Beauty with a Purpose (the Miss World charity) and that's what got me into the pageanting scene.' With her cropped hair and undercut Jade doesn't exactly fit the pageanting stereotype, however Jade says that her alternative looks have helped her secure modelling jobs in the past that led to her success at the Miss Surrey contest. 'I worked as a gothic model when I was younger. You are always offered cash or the pictures from the shoot and I always picked the pictures so that I was able to build up my portfolio.' Jade says that by winning a beauty pageant she hopes to show other women that you don't have to conform to a stereotype to win or even enter a contest. Jade also hopes to further her singing career having appeared on last year's X Factor . 'I want to use the way I look to promote diversity and I want to inspire other girls and show them that you don't have to be stick thin to enter. There are no rules, anyone can enter. I did and I won. 'I believe all women are beautiful in their own way and that they should not feel the need to look the same just to fit in.' Jade added that many young women are unaware that there are no requirements to enter a pageant and she believes that is down to bad stereotypes. 'A lot people think that beauty pageants are old-fashioned because they have this perception of a traditional looking girl, but it's not the pageants that are old-fashioned, it's the public's perception.' Jade's hair helped to set her apart from her more traditional looking competitors but rather than rely on a salon for her perfect crop, Jade looks to her own mother, Sara. 'My mum is the only person allowed to cut my hair I never go to salons. I have had my cropped hair for about six years, and will probably always have it. 'Short hair suits my body and face shape and I will not grow it or put extensions in so that I look the same as other contestants.' When it comes to beauty inspiration Jade looks to fellow short-haired celebrities. 'My idol is Grace Jones I think she shows how glamorous you can be with short hair but I also love Halle Berry. I've always wanted to be in a Bond film so she is a real inspiration.' Jade is certainly ambitious and as well as aiming for gold at the Miss England finals in September the 24-year-old hopes to progress in her singing career having reached the boot camp stages of X Factor last year. 'I never take on a permanent job I only ever do temporary work. I'm a singer and I sing a lot so if a job comes up for me I don't want to be restricted by a full-time job,' she says.

Article text: Labour and the Scottish Nationalists could form a ‘permanent alliance’ at Westminster, it is claimed today. Despite mounting pressure on Ed Miliband to rule out any deal with the rampant SNP, one Labour strategist has floated the idea of an enduring ‘German-style’ agreement with the party, according to the New Statesman magazine. It was described as a ‘CDU-CSU scenario’, mirroring a deal between Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats with the Christian Social Union in the German state of Bavaria. Despite mounting pressure on Ed Miliband to rule out any deal with the rampant SNP (spurred by a Conservative poster, above), one Labour strategist has reportedly floated the idea of a partnership . The CDU does not stand candidates in Bavaria in exchange for support in Germany’s Bundestag from the CSU. Labour peer Lord Foulkes, a former MP in Scotland, broke ranks last night to insist Mr Miliband should rule out any post-election deal. ‘Every Labour MP and peer to whom I’ve spoken thinks we should rule out any kind of deal with the SNP. What are we waiting for?’ he demanded. A national poll last night found 61 per cent of voters would be unhappy with a power-sharing deal involving the SNP. Labour voters were marginally more sympathetic to the idea, with 44 per cent in favour of some sort of deal, the survey by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft found. While the SNP has indicated it would not enter a formal coalition, it has suggested it would prop up a minority Labour government in key Commons votes in exchange for concessions. A Labour source insisted the idea of a permanent deal that would mean the party withdrawing from Scotland was ‘b*******’. The strategist reportedly claimed a deal could mirror the one held in Germany by the CDU and CSU . Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats merge with the Christian Social Union in the German state of Bavaria . Tony Blair’s £1,000 donations for each of Labour’s 106 key battleground seats have sparked a furious row in the party, after two candidates turned down the cash. The former prime minister’s spin doctor Alastair Campbell branded them ‘attention seeking’ in a furious rant on Twitter. Sally Keeble, a junior minister under Mr Blair, announced yesterday that she would be turning down the money. She was MP for Northampton North and is now trying to resurrect her political career after losing her seat in 2010 in the wake of the expenses scandal. It followed the decision by Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan to also reject the cash. Mr Campbell wrote on Twitter: ‘To attention seeking candidates rejected TB money 1. He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?’ Labour activists responded angrily and praised the two women refusing the cash. Labour said the money was being accepted on behalf of the whole party and indicated it was not for individual candidates to refuse.

Article text: A 21-year-old woman has regular brushes with death and in one year was pronounced clinically dead 36 times. Sara Brautigam was four years ago diagnosed with Postural orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS), a condition which makes her heart race while standing upright. She experiences rapid palpitations that regularly cause her heart to stop beating and her blood pressure to plummet to what doctors record as clinically dead. Ms Brautigam said that she has contacted other people with the same condition, but none of those people's hearts have stopped . 'They can't give me CPR because CPR tires the heart out for no reason so it is pointless. When the heart fills up with blood again is when it begins beating again. 'The blood tends to pool in my legs and the doors need to help feed it back to the heart.' 'I can't have oxygen because it prolongs the attack. 'In fact it is just a case of leaving me there and praying. The only thing they can do is put me on a drip,' she added. Ms Brautigam, from Doncaster, said each time her heart stops medics have to inflict pain on her to shock her into coming back to life. She said: 'When it happens paramedics try and do anything to inflict pain to try and shock me into coming back to life. Ms Brautigam lies in a hospital bed after undergoing one of her regular episodes caused by her heart condition . Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) can be a life altering and debilitating chronic health condition. Simply standing up can be a challenge for people with PoTS as their body is unable to adjust to gravity. PoTS is characterised by what's known as orthostatic intolerance - the development of symptoms when upright that are relieved by lying down. Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, palpitations, sweating, nausea, fainting and dizziness. They are associated with an increase in heart rate from the lying to upright position of greater than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing. For more information: http://www.potsuk.org/ . 'A lot of the time I'll wake up with big bruises. On one occasion they ripped an acrylic nail off but that still didn't make me flinch.' Ms Brautigam said that she has contacted people with PoTS, but none of those people's hearts have stopped. She also suffers joint hypermobility syndrome which means her joints are more prone to injury and dislocation. The two combined resulted in her visiting A&E a staggering 64 times in one year. 'When I was still canoeing I had an attack in my boat and when I came around I was screaming before I knew it because I had somehow dislocated my shoulder and damaged my back while I was passed out.' But Ms Brautigam - who has canoed for Great Britain - says she is determined not to let the conditions hold her back and is now trying to make a life as a burlesque performer. She said: 'There are signs before it happens - I'll feel dizzy or sick and really tired and then I feel as though I'm falling asleep.I can hear everything around me and feel as though I'm trying to shout but nothing is coming out. 'They say when you die your hearing is the last thing to go and that's been my experience. After an attack I'll wake up and my chest will be killing and I'm really tired. 'I get asked it quite a lot, but there is definitely no bright light. Everything just goes black. 'You can still hear things and there is a voice in my head that is still active and still conscious and it is trying to communicate with those around me. I can remember what people are saying when I black out but have no other awareness of what's going on.' She was told she could no longer take part in the sport and her dreams of joining the Navy were also left in tatters. Even getting a job and and driving were affected by the condition. She added: 'I had 10 years of being out every weekend canoeing and being so active and it all came crashing down. I piled on the weight because I couldn't exercise and was really upset. 'All my dreams came crashing down, I can't even work at the minute because I would need a job that could be very flexible. Then I was told I couldn't drive, it was like everything was being taken away from me. 'I lost a lot of friends, in fact I only have one friend from school. Everyone seemed to be too busy with their own lives to bother with me when I was diagnosed.'
