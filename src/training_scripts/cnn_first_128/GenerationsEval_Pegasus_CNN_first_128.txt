A father has been left devastated after it was revealed two men who were arrested for burglarizing his home allegedly threw away the ashes of his daughter, who died 10 years ago. Joel Tuck arrived at his Franklin, Tennessee home on Monday to find that his back door was wide open and it's glass window had been broken. Two flat-screen TVs, several checkbooks and a bottle of liquor were stolen. But it was when Tuck realized a pink purse was missing that his heart dropped. The pink purse belonged to his daughter Whitney, who died in 2005 at the age of 19 after losing her battle with leukemia. Her ashes were kept in a box inside the purse, which had been her favorite. Franklin police arrested Jwyanza Weaver and Christopher Gengler in connection to the burglary. They are currently in custody. Both men are convicted felons and Weaver was on probation at the time of his arrest, according to the Tennessean. According to police, the two men drove to a gas station after burglarizing the home. It was there that Gengler threw away the pink purse into a trash can. For Tuck, who kept the purse in his room, the entire ordeal has felt like losing his daughter all over again. He said it will probably haunt him for the rest of his life. Scroll down for video .

For Tuck, who kept the purse in his room, the entire ordeal has felt like losing his daughter all over again . 'I would touch that bag and talk and different things,' he told WKRN. 'It gave me a sense of peace that she's still with me.' Whitney's ashes were stored inside a matte black wooden box. Also inside the purse was a second box, engraved with the name Duchess, that held the cremated remains of Whitney's puppy, who died shortly after her. Police searched a number of dumpsters for six hours but have still not located the pink purse. Chief Deborah Faulkner said the bag can be dropped off 'a police station, a fire station, or anywhere else someone will find them and call us,' no questions asked. There is a $1,000 reward for information pertaining to the case. Gengler and Weaver have been charged with aggravated burglary and theft.

Article text: Derek Jackson, 52, who was found dead in his Biddeston home, had a history of criminal behaviour and mental health issues . A grandfather whose body was found alongside his slain seven-year-old grandson and heavily pregnant daughter in a suspected murder-suicide, was well known to police and had a long history of mental illness. Derek John Sharpley, 52, was found dead of gunshot wounds to the head in the same room that his grandson Jackson's body was found tucked into a bed at his Biddeston property, west of Brisbane in Queensland. His 27-year-old daughter Kris-Deann Sharpley, who had moved to the Queensland town in 2011 to care for him following her mother's death, also died of gunshot wounds to the head and was found in the bathroom. Detective Inspector David Isherwood would not confirm the details of Mr Sharpley's criminal history, but told Daily Mail Australia that there had been no recent incidents. 'They [the family] are known to police and in regard to criminal history; the reality is that while he has a criminal history, it's not recent history,' Inspector Isherwood said. 'But he has got a criminal history and there is no doubt that he has had mental health issues.' Mr Sharpley is believed to have attempted suicide in the past and had a history of substance abuse, according to The Courier Mail. Police have stopped short of dubbing the incident a murder-suicide, but have said it is unlikely another party was involved. His daughter Kris-Deann Sharpley (left), who had moved to the town to care for him following her mother's death, was found dead in the bathroom while her seven-year-old son (rigth) Jackson's body was found in a bed . 'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' Inspector Isherwood said. Mr Sharpley is believed to have shot himself after killing his daughter and grandson, however detectives have been unable to determine the young boy's cause of death after preliminary pathology results returned inconclusive. Inspector Isherwood said there were no signs of physical injury on the child's body and that police were awaiting further results before making any conclusions about how he died. 'There are a couple of issues, they [forensic pathologists] think, with the decomposition. You'd think that with strangulation there would be lesion marks on the neck. What often happens in a lot of bodies in that case is that the head is tilted forward and you get bruising in the front of the body,' Inspector Isherwood said. 'Suffocation is very hard to prove, so the issue we've got is we really don't know'. Detective Inspector David Isherwood told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Sharpley 'was not the owner of a registered firearm', but would not release any other information about the gun used to kill the two adults . Detectives have been unable to determine Jackson's (pictured) cause of death after preliminary pathology results returned inconclusive. Suffocation and strangulation are still being investigated . The owner of the high-calibre gun used to kill both adults, which was found lying on a bed, has also been an unclear aspect of the case. Inspector Isherwood told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Sharpley 'was not the owner of a registered firearm', but would not release any other information about the gun. He said detectives would return to the address on Thursday to obtain any more evidence that could be relevant to the case. It comes after revelations that Kris-Deann  was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl who she'd chosen to name Amber Elizabeth Rose after her late mother when she was slain, her sister-in-law Sara Turnball told the Courier Mail. All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann's (left) sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings . Detectives will return to the address on Thursday to obtain any more evidence that could be relevant to the case . All three bodies were found by Kris-Deann's sister Tara on Monday evening when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs. Tara, who is also pregnant, was accompanied by her boyfriend Allan Brown and had to climb through a window to gain access to the house. Mr Brown told the Courier Mail that Tara screamed out: 'They've been murdered, they've been murdered.' The scene at Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road home was so grisly it distressed first-response police officers, according to Detective Inspector David Isherwood. A dog barks behind a gate at a house in which the bodies of a man, a woman and a young boy were found in Biddeston, west of Toowoomba, Queensland . Police guard a house where the bodies of the relatives were found on Monday night . 'Two of the victims, both the adult male and female, had very serious wounds to their bodies,' he said. 'Both appear to have been shot in the head.' 'At this point in time there's nothing to suggest there was any incident that occurred in terms of a disturbance.' 'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots.' The gunshots were heard on Sunday night but locals presumed it was someone shotting an animal. Kris-Deann Sharpley was on maternity leave and excitedly awaiting the birth of her little girl . Kris-Deann shared this photo of her son Jackson and a scan of her unborn child Amber on Facebook before she was killed . 'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure. The first person who attended the residence had to climb in to gain entry.' 'Police attended a Biddeston Southbrook Road address around 6.50pm after the bodies of a man, woman and boy were located. The three aged 52, 27 and 7 respectively, were all known to each other,' Queensland Police said. The shooting happened on the corner of Toowoomba-Cecil Plains Road and Biddeston-Southbrook Road at Biddeston - more than 150 kilometres west of Brisbane. 'There are no concerns for public safety,' a police spokesman said. Readers seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14. Forensic officers took photographs after arriving at the scene on Monday night . Forensic officers are seen outside the house where the bodies of a man, a woman and a young boy were found . Local businessman Paul Farmer described the home owner as 'a quiet, friendly guy' Biddeston is a rural town  in the Toowoomba Region, Queensland, and is home to less than 400 people .

Article text: (CNN)India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has told all news channels not to air a controversial documentary about rape in India -- warning that the excerpts "appear to encourage and incite violence against women." The BBC Storyville documentary was originally scheduled to air Sunday, but due to the "intense level of interest" in the program, the BBC aired it Wednesday in the UK on BBC Four "to enable viewers to see this incredibly powerful documentary at the earliest opportunity," the broadcaster said in a statement. The documentary was released online and the hashtag #IndiasDaughter was trending in the UK after it aired. The documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case that sparked massive outrage and protests in India. An Indian court restricted the publication and airing of the film in India as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after Mukesh Singh's comments were released in several media outlets. Singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night, according to the documentary called "India's Daughter." "The media is likely to be seen as a voice for the perpetrator of such crimes by providing him a medium to communicate his views on the matter repeatedly," said a letter sent to media outlets by the Indian government. Despite the ban, the documentary can be seen on YouTube in India. Singh told the documentary crew that his victim "should just be silent and allow the rape." "A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night," he told the BBC. "A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. "Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes." He suggested that they "had a right to teach them a lesson." In a statement, India's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview, which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament on Wednesday that permission would not be granted to anyone in the future to interview prison inmates after the uproar over the documentary. "The government has taken necessary legal action and obtained a restraining order from the court disseminating the contents of the film," according to the statement. India's constitution guarantees free speech with a caveat that it could be restricted when speech is deemed a threat to public order, incitement to an offense or an act of contempt of court. In December 2012, a young woman was savagely attacked and raped by a group of men aboard a public bus in New Delhi and later died from her injuries. Mukesh Singh, who was driving the bus, is now on death row and has filed an appeal. His comments in the documentary have stirred fierce debate about whether airing his interview gives him a platform to share his misogyny, versus those who say it increases awareness and understanding of the horror of rape. The documentary's director, Leslee Udwin, wrote that she was "deeply saddened" by attempts to silence the film. "India should be embracing this film -- not blocking it with a knee-jerk hysteria without even seeing it. This was an opportunity for India to continue to show the world how much has changed since this heinous crime," she wrote for India's NDTV. Udwin later spoke to NDTV, urging everyone to watch the film before rushing to judgment on it. "I appeal to the Prime Minister to not let it go out of hand because it is getting out of hand. Countries around the world will very soon be saying: 'How dare India ban a documentary that is in the public interest?' I urge you to see the film as soon as possible," she said. "Please see the film and then talk about it." Several supporters of the film echoed the notion that even airing the repugnant views increases awareness and points to a more systematic problem. One said that it is the role of journalism to report "on the sickness," and actress Freida Pinto asked: "Airing the truth a crime? How?" One journalist expressed concerns that the use of prior restraint amounted to censorship by the government and set a precedent. The debate in social media caused hashtags #NirbhayaInsulted and #IndiasDaughter to trend in India. Many criticized the documentary for giving rapists a platform to share their thoughts and justify rape. One asked why "rapists are treated as celebrities." Lawyer and prominent feminist Indira Jaising called the filmmaker "irresponsible." "Creating public space for them, encouraging tolerance of any form of violence, what the film will do, it will project justifications for rape -- which I think is completely wrong. It's going on public view where young people will be seeing it, there's no guarantee these convicts won't be seen as natural role models for most." Many questioned how Udwin was able to obtain 16 hours of interviews with the imprisoned Singh. The home minister told the upper house of Parliament on Wednesday that no one would be allowed to "leverage" the 2012 gang rape for commercial purposes. He also said that the filmmakers violated the conditions for the shoot inside Tihar prison and that officials would determine who granted permission for the interview. One prominent feminist said she opposed airing the documentary because it infringed on India's laws. Singh and three other convicts are currently appealing their death sentences. Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, said she didn't have a problem with people viewing the film but said the timing was not appropriate. "The concern is that the airing of the documentary will result in a media trial -- that will essentially leave the judiciary with no option but to uphold the death penalty," she said. "My main problem, how can we screen this documentary when there's an appeals process underway?" Krishnan suggested that the documentary's title, "India's Daughter," inferred that Indians were badly in need of a rescue mission, leaving the impression of a "white savior" complex. "India's Daughter" is directed by Udwin, a British woman who spent two years on the project. She said she was inspired by the mass protests that followed the gang rape case in Delhi. Among the voices in the debate, some were critical of what they perceived as Western bias that depicts India as a place of misogyny when rape and sexual assaults are universal. "I have tried to convey that while we in India are in fact engaged in confronting the violence and discrimination against women here, it does not help for people in other countries to imagine that such brutality is India's 'cultural' problem; that India's 'backwardness' is the problem; or that gender violence is 'worse out there in India,'" Krishnan wrote. CNN's Madison Park reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi.

Article text: The Swedish driver's licence examiner has come under fire after asking students if it is 'a mitigating circumstance' if a woman is drunk during sexual assault. Learner drivers undergoing a compulsory theory course on drink-driving have been invited to discuss several rape scenarios where alcohol is involved. The organisation behind the material has defended the use of questions involving rape, saying it is intended to inspire discussion about using alcohol 'as an excuse when you do something stupid'. Anger: Sweden's driver's licence examiner asked learner drivers to discuss if it is 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance' if a woman is drunk during a sexual assault (stock image) The theory booklet is used across Sweden for compulsory risk-assessment courses as part of the drivers licence theory exam, which mostly undertaken by 16 to 18-year-olds. Learner drivers are asked to discuss several scenarios where alcohol and drugs are involved, including two about rape with no relation to traffic or driving. The book asks: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished, is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?' It also described a similar rape-scenario where the male perpetrator is 'intoxicated' and whether that would be 'an aggravating or mitigating circumstance' in court. Linnea Risinger, 32, from Falun, Dalarna, spotted the questions during her course, and posted a picture of it on her Facebook. The two questions read: 'An intoxicated woman is raped by a man. When he is punished is it an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that she was intoxicated?,' and similarly 'An intoxicated man rapes a woman' Unrelated question: The questions were asked during a compulsory course which all learner drivers in Sweden must undergo in order to get their licence (stock image) The picture caused heated reactions, with many asking what the rape scenarios had to do with getting a driver's licence. Ms Risinger said she had been surprised to see the questions, especially as there could be victims of sexual assault forced to take part in discussions about rape in a context where they could not be expected to be prepared for them. 'Rape has nothing to do with a driver's licence,' Ms Risinger, a spokesperson for the local Green Party, told Aftonbladet. 'It is not okay that you should be forced to discuss during a compulsory course to get your licence. 'It is highly likely that there are boys and girls who take part in this course who are victims. They are there to get a driver's licence, not go to therapy.' However, The Swedish National Organisation for Driving Schools (Sveriges trafikskolors riksförbund) defends the use of the rape scenarios, saying it shines a light on the fact that alcohol is often used as an excuse when 'doing something stupid'. 'We want a discussion about taking responsibility for your actions, and that is the reason the questions are in there,' a representative told newspaper ETC.

Article text: This Irish setter, named Jagger, is feared to have been murdered at the Crufts dog competition . The world of dog breeding was rocked by scandal last night amid allegations that a prize-winner at this year's Crufts was deliberately poisoned. In a plot straight from the pages of a detective drama, a breeder claimed her £50,000 Irish setter died after he was fed meat laced with toxins. But she believes the poisoner mistakenly targeted the wrong dog and had intended to kill another of her Irish setters that looks very similar. In what could become the biggest scandal in Crufts' 124-year history, three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died on Friday, the day after coming second in his class at the world's most famous dog show. Tests found that Jagger – pedigree name Thendara Satisfaction – had eaten cubed beef laced with up to three poisons. However co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott believes the intended victim was four-year-old Noodle, pedigree name Thendara Pot Noodle, who won best of breed on the day Jagger competed. The two almost identical looking dogs had switched places on the benches where entrants sit before and after going in the show ring at the NEC in Birmingham. Jagger died in the arms of joint owner Alexandra Lauwers at her home in Belgium. She reported his death to police and animal welfare officials there, and to the Kennel Club, which runs Crufts. CCTV footage from the NEC is being reviewed but West Midlands Police and the RSPCA here have yet to be informed officially. The target? Noodle, pedigree name Thendara Pot Noodle, at Crufts with co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott . There has been controversy over the increasing number of foreign dogs allowed to compete at Crufts, which attracts more than 20,000 entries from 200 breeds. This year's competition ended last night with Knopa, a foreign-owned Scottish terrier, being named best in show. But Jagger's owners say he could have been fed the poisoned meat by a 'random psychopathic dog hater' or a jealous rival breeder. The Kennel Club said it had not heard of such an incident before and promised to assist any police inquiries. Last night Mrs Milligan-Bott, 56, said she had 'done nothing but cry' over Jagger's death. She said: 'We think this is the work of some random psychopathic dog hater who decided to visit Crufts with one thing in mind, rather than any sort of targeted attack.' Mrs Milligan-Bott, who breeds and shows Afghan hounds and Irish setters with her husband Jeremy Bott, 66, said tests showed Jagger had been killed by a 'pesticide-type' poison. She said: 'Some sadistic person out there poisoned our dog. Crufts is a high-profile event and we live in a very anti-dog society.' The holding area where dogs are 'benched' before and after competing is open to the public, although they are asked not to touch the animals. In what could become the biggest scandal in Crufts' 124-year history, three-year-old Jagger collapsed and died on Friday, the day after coming second in his class at the world's most famous dog show . Clare Balding posted a message on Twitter about the incident after it was confirmed that a dog had died . She plans to inform West Midlands Police of the circumstances surrounding Jagger's death when she receives the written toxicology report later this week. Mrs Milligan-Bott said she had heard of rumours of skullduggery involving other breeders at shows but had not come across anything like this in 30 years of competing. 'I don't believe it had anything to do with other competitors,' she said. 'We have had so many calls [from other breeders who were at the show]... everybody has been pulling together and offering support.' She is convinced Jagger was fed poisoned meat when he was on the bench on one of the handful of occasions he was left on his own for up to 15 minutes – the only times he was unattended. She is unsure if that was before or after he entered the show ring. She told Dog World magazine's website that nothing appeared untoward until both dogs returned to her home in Kilsby, Northamptonshire, after competing on the first day of the show on Thursday. 'All the dogs were all running and playing together and Jagger seemed a bit tired, unable to keep up with the others,' she said. 'Three or four hours later, after getting back to Belgium, he collapsed and by the time the vet arrived he was dead. The post-mortem showed that two or three different poisons were used and that it is likely it was administered on Thursday morning. 'We're now waiting for exact toxicology reports. Whoever did this knew what they were doing, trying to get exactly the right type of poison with a slow release.' The animal had won second in his class when he was at Crufts and his owner think he was poisoned there . The dogs had changed places on the bench after one became agitated about being near a bitch in season, it is understood. In another twist, Mrs Milligan-Bott said the best of breed and challenge certificates won by Noodle had mysteriously been taken from the benches at some point. 'And at Richmond last year someone let one of my dogs off its bench and he went missing, before being found on someone else's bench,' she added. 'It's been suggested that someone's really got it in for us, and to not let it get to us. There do seem to be too many coincidences.' Mrs Milligan-Bott, whose setters were named Thendara after her kennels, which has a worldwide reputation for breeding champion show dogs, added: 'It's turning into such a nasty sport. I went back to Crufts on Saturday but I was like a zombie – I just thought, 'I don't want to do this any more'.' A post on her Facebook page outlined the death of 'our beautiful boy' Jagger and warned other competitors not to leave their dogs unattended at Crufts. At her home in Tongeren, near Liege, Mrs Lauwers, 34, a full-time breeder who takes her dogs to see the elderly in residential homes, said: 'They have not only taken away a dog, or merely a pet, they have taken away a family member. 'It should be a hobby and nothing more. To think he may have been poisoned by a rival at a dog show just makes it even harder to take. 'How people can resort to killing a helpless animal from jealousy or hate for a dog in a competition is too much to comprehend. I know people take it seriously but If you want to target me, smash my windows or something – don't go and kill my pet dog. Jagger took part in the competition on Thursday and achieved second place in his class at Crufts . The dog's owners said he appeared to be following the footsteps of 2010 best of breed winner Mr Jingles . Jagger fell ill when he returned to his other owners in Belgium and died before a vet was able to get to him . The title of best in show was won last night by a five-year-old Scottish terrier named Knopa. Bred in the US and owned by Russians, Knopa, who competes under the name McVan's To Russia With Love, was shown by American Rebecca Cross, who said it marked Knopa's retirement as a show dog. Dublin, a flat-coated retriever from Sweden which had won the gundog category, was overall runner-up. The ceremony was temporarily halted when the stage was stormed by a protester waving a sign saying: 'Mutts against Crufts.' 'He could have been targeted for being a foreign dog, there's a lot of ill feeling from some camps towards them for some reason. 'But first and foremost he was our pet and we are absolutely distraught. He died right in front of me in my arms, there was nothing we could do. My little boy is only nine, he is devastated.' Mrs Lauwers took Jagger's body to a clinic. She said they found 'green and black substances inside cubes of beef' in his stomach. 'Jagger loved people and he loved food - he would have just trusted whoever gave it to him,' she said. On her Facebook page, she added: 'To the person who has done it, hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed our love, family member and best friend to our son.' She is due to give a full statement to police today and toxicology reports are due to be completed on Wednesday or Thursday. Jagger cost around £850 as a puppy and won best of breed at the Ladies' Kennel Association show at the NEC in December. Because of his pedigree, success in shows and value as a stud dog, he could have commanded a price of up to £50,000, experts said. Jagger was not insured for any particular sum of money, however, only by normal pet insurance which covers vets' fees. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko said: 'The Kennel Club is deeply shocked and saddened to hear that Jagger the Irish setter died some 26 hours after leaving Crufts. 'We have spoken to his owners and our heartfelt sympathies go out to them. We understand that the toxicology report is due next week and until that time we cannot know the cause of this tragic incident.' Jagger was the son of Mr Jingles, the dog which won Crufts Best in Breed 2010 .

Article text: A preliminary report detailing actor Harrison Ford's actions just seconds before he crash-landed his 1940s vintage plane on to a California golf course was today released by federal transport officials. The document, issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica  Airport last Thursday. He then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground. The plane - which came to rest around 800 feet from the approach end of a runway at the airport -sustained 'substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage' in the smash,  the document states. Scroll down for video . Bloodied: A preliminary report detailing actor Harrison Ford's actions just seconds before he crash-landed his 1940s vintage plane on to a California golf course was today released by federal transport officials. Above, Ford is pictured being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher last Thursday . Wrecked: The document, issued by the NTSB, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Airport last Thursday. Above, Ford's wrecked plane after the crash . Document: Ford then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report (pictured) states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground . Meanwhile, Ford, who played Han Solo in the original Star Wars series, suffered serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. However, he is expected to make a full recovery. The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash. This meant he did not need to submit a flight plan. It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport'. Ford 'initiated a left turn back towards the airport; the airplane subsequently struck the top of a tall tree prior to impacting the ground in an open area of a golf course,' the report states. It concludes: 'The airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.' The report was constructed 'using data from various sources' after 'a significant amount of investigative work'. It does not detail why Ford's engine might have failed, causing him to plummet to the ground. A final report is expected to be released when NTSB officials have finished their inquiry into the crash. Devoted: Ford suffered serious injuries in the crash, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. Above, his wife, Calista Flockhart, is seen on Tuesday driving home from hospital after spending the entire day with him . Recovery: Ford is being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (pictured) in Los Angeles, California . Last week, dramatic pictures emerged showing Ford being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher, his face covered in blood and his neck strapped into a brace. First responders were also pictured wrapping bandages around his head. 'He was stunned a bit,' spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana, who was playing golf at the course at the time, told ABC News. He added: 'He was moaning and in pain. It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious.' A video also emerged showing horrified golfers gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way as Ford deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground. Investigators at the scene: The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash, meaning he did not need to submit a flight plan . Taken away: It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport' In a tweet late Thursday, Ford's son, Ben, said his famous father was 'battered, but OK.' Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, remains in hospital recovering from the crash. His wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side. The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours. Flockhart was seen at the wheel of a black Lexus pulling out of the hospital parking garage with an older male companion. The former Ally McBeal star looked like she hadn't slept in a while. Her face was make-up free, while her eyes were dark-circled and bleary from possible crying. Her light brown hair hung limply around her face and her manner of dress appeared simple and casual. Couple: Earlier this week, it was said Flockhart is strongly urging her husband (pictured with her in January) to call it quits on his passion for flying and stay grounded because he might not be so fortunate next time . Avid flier: In a tweet late Thursday, Ford's son, Ben, said his famous father (pictured in 2001) was 'battered, but OK.' Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, is in hospital recovering from the crash . Earlier this week, it was claimed that Flockhart is strongly urging her husband to call it quits on his passion for flying and stay grounded because he might not be so fortunate next time. 'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' her friend told The Mirror. 'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby.' They added: 'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is ­obviously a huge worry.' Flockhart is not the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend. Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy, it is said. Film star: Flockhart is not the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend. Ford's Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher (pictured, center, as Princess Leia) has also urged the actor (left, as Han Solo) to 'take a break' Addressing Ford, who also starred as Indiana Jones, she told PEOPLE magazine: 'I know you have incredible bounce back, please take a bounce break for awhile. Can I drive next time?' Officials are currently inspecting the wreckage of the plane and  documents regarding its upkeep. 'The aircraft will be examined, the engine will be examined, the records of the aircraft will be examined and ultimately we'll submit a factual report,' Patrick Jones, of the NTSB said. He added: 'The final report probably will not be out for a year.'

Article text: (The Hollywood Reporter)Albert Maysles, who collaborated along with his late brother David in a documentary film career that included the troubling 1970 concert documentary "Gimme Shelter," has died. He was 88. The director and cinematographer, an Oscar nominee, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan of natural causes, Stacey Farrar, marketing director at the Maysles Center in New York, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. "Gimme Shelter" -- which chronicled the 1969 Rolling Stones tour that culminated in the Altamont Free Concert, in which a fan brandishing a gun was stabbed to death by a Hells Angels security man — stood in a stark and more enduring counterpoint to the myth of the documentary "Woodstock," a depiction of the glorified 1969 free concert whose own dark side was left out in its pre-conceived, celebratory style. Their most well-known film, "Grey Gardens" (1975), was a profile of Jacqueline Onassis' eccentric cousins -- mother and daughter Big Edie and Little Edie Bouvier -- who lived in a dilapidated, cat-packed estate in East Hampton, New York. The brothers worked with fellow directors Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer on the film, which was remade as a Tony-winning Broadway play and as an award-winning 2009 HBO drama that starred Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange. Just prior to "Gimme Shelter," they filmed "Salesman" (1969), which covered six weeks in the lives of four door-to-door Bible salesmen. The brothers, who preferred the moniker of filmmaker rather than director, often focused on musical figures. Maysles was a cameraman on D.A. Pennebaker's "Monterey Pop" (1968), about the celebrated California music festival that featured electrifying performances from the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. TCM Classic Film Fest: Albert Maysles on Freeing Cameras, Capturing Truths (Video) During that period of their career, they also collaborated on such direct cinemas as "What's Happening! The Beatles in the U.S.A." (1964), "With Love From Truman" (1966) and "Meet Marlon Brando" (1966), which premiered at the New York Film Festival. In 1968, they made "Vladimir Horowitz: The Last Romantic," and the following year, they shot "Horowitz Plays Mozart," also for TV. "People are people. We're out to discover what is going on behind the scenes and get as close as we can to what is happening," he said of their cinematic style. There were often emotional reactions to their films; fans applauded them for the trust they developed with their subjects, allowing them to reveal long-repressed feelings or telling insights. Their style -- with their subjects caught by a hand-held camera and shotgun mike -- was in the tradition of such documentarians as Frederick Wiseman. However, cinema verite "purists" argued that the Maysleses sometimes exploited the content, particularly in regard to the omniscient editing of "Gimme Shelter," where their flashback storytelling style created a dramatic foreboding and "imposed" a narrative on the Stones' tour. Flashbacking from Mick Jagger reviewing their footage, with Altamont's horrific memory in the recent past, "Gimme Shelter" punctuated a feeling of dread as the events moved inexorably to the tour's cataclysmic end. Originally, the "free concert" was planned to happen in San Francisco, but logistics went askew and it ended up at the Altamont Speedway in Northern California. Muddled by inadequate planning and the darkness at the fringes of the peace/love zeitgeist, the concert was a ghoulish nightmare. Admittedly, the Maysleses straddled a line between artistic license and nonfiction narrative. "Al and Dave often argue that all they're doing is filming what's there. The detail is comment: fingers scratching, soft focusing. A filmmaker is always making comments," cinematographer Haskell Wexler once opined in a Village Voice article. He and his brother, who died in January 1987 at age 55, received an Oscar nomination for the 28-minute short "Christo's Valley Curtain" (1974), about the artist's first public work. That year, Albert shot film of the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman 1974 heavyweight title bout in Zaire that would become the 1996 Oscar-winning documentary "When We Were Kings." Maysles won three Emmys, two for his work with his brother on "The Last Romantic" and "Soldiers of Music" (1991) and one for "Abortion: Desperate Choices" (1991). In 2001, he shot "Lalee's Kin: A Legacy of Cotton" for HBO, a depiction of rural poverty in the Mississippi Delta that he created with Susan Froemke and Deborah Dickson, with whom he also worked on "Desperate Choices." Maysles also filmed half-hour portraits of filmmakers including Martin Scorsese, Robert Duvall and Jane Campion, and he remained quite active in his later years. Hollywood's Notable Deaths of 2015 . He was born November 26, 1926, in Boston and raised in nearby Brookline, Massachusetts. He got a B.A. at Syracuse University and a masters at Boston University, where he subsequently taught. During World War II, he was stationed at the U.S. Army's Headquarters Intelligence School in Oberammergau, Germany. In the mid-1950s, Maysles traveled to Russia, where he made a 1955 film on mental health care and psychiatry in Russia. It was shown on NBC's "Today" show and by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. In 1957, the brothers began working as a team. They traveled from Munich to Moscow by motorcycle and made a film about the Polish student revolution, 'Youth in Poland," which was televised by NBC. Next, they worked on an experimental TV project for Time Inc., with Maysles shooting Primary and Yanqui No! In 1962, they formed their own company. They made "Showman," a portrait of movie magnate Joseph E. Levine that brought them attention. The film was acclaimed on the festival circuit, but the Maysles dubbed it an "expensive resume." They subsequently won a Guggenheim Fellowship in Experimental Film. People we've lost in 2015 . ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.

Article text: Apple’s Touch ID is fast and accurate - until your hand is even the slightest bit dirty or wet. But in the near future these scanners will not only work when your fingerprints are obscured, they will work behind layers of glass and metal. Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner capable of capturing everything from ridges to sweat pores using ultrasonic technology. The demo version (pictured) was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick, and Qualcomm did not reveal what the maximum thickness is. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with . A prototype version of the sensor is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. When a finger is placed on the tiny sensor - the demo version has a 9mm by 4mm ‘active area’ - the software captures an image of the fingerprint instantly. Apple’s Touch ID (pictured) is fast and accurate - until your hand is even the slightest bit dirty or wet . This is stored and used to authenticate a user quickly, with little margin of error. And because it uses waves that bounce off the surface of the finger it can be used behind materials such as glass or metal. The demo version was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick, and Qualcomm did not reveal what the maximum thickness is. The firm did say, though, that the technology makes it more accurate and powerful than capacitive sensors, like those seen on Apple and Samsung devices. And this is the reason why it works even if the user has dirty hands, has recently applied hand lotion and other similar scenarios. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. Fujitsu has developed a ‘custom compact and high-output infrared LED’, and a custom infrared camera. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina . These were combined with Fujitsu’s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology. It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris. The pattern doesn’t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge. Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina. For its prototype, Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone. It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera. This pattern is registered and linked to the user. Each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device. ‘The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations,’ a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline . ‘This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance, rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require. ‘And in safety testing, the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes.’

Article text: John Davies: Police are still working to track down the conman . A flamboyant conman who funded an extravagant lifestyle by swindling £750,000 from struggling businesses has gone missing after being convicted of fraud. John Davies, 53, of Milton Keynes, left a trail of misery in his wake, with 'numerous' people losing their jobs and companies as a result of his actions. After his six-week trial police detailed how he had lived a 'flamboyant lifestyle on the back of despicable crimes', buying a house complete with the latest cinema system and a luxury kitchen. On Wednesday, he was found guilty in his absence of 12 counts of fraud by breach of trust. Police have since issued a warrant for his arrest. The court case, at Aylesbury Crown Court in Buckinghamshire, related to Davies' dealings with nine different companies where he gained in excess of £750,000. He was convicted of 11 counts by a unanimous jury decision, and one by a majority verdict. The court was told how he had spent his ill-gotten gains on a luxury lifestyle, including more than £70,000 on a new Range Rover and foreign holidays to Barbados and Las Vegas. Davies, of Dean Forest Way, Broughton, Milton Keynes, claimed to be an insolvency and business adviser but he was not licensed. Between 2007 and 2013 he targeted distressed companies, claiming he could help restructure their debts. But although he often advised companies they should go into liquidation or administration, he would delay doing so in order to gain control of companies' remaining assets which he used for his own personal gain. The prosecution said he gained his victims' trust and then took the money that was due to the company creditors which he then spent on himself. His swindles - carried out in Theale in Berkshire, Kent, and Northamptonshire - meant people lost their jobs, livelihoods and companies. Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit spent more than two years collating evidence against him. Following the trial investigating officer Detective Constable Stephanie Burleigh said: 'I am very grateful to all the victims and witnesses who took the time to come to court and give statements to support the proceedings against this serial fraudster. 'Company fraud is not a victimless crime, Davies ruined many livelihoods and Thames Valley Police take these crimes seriously. Davies kept a lavish £70,000 Range Rover along with other trappings of the jet-set lifestyle (file photo) The fraudster used his ill-gotten money to pay for luxury holidays to Las Vegas (left) and Barbados (right) 'Davies has led a flamboyant lifestyle on the back of these despicable crimes which have caused so much misery up and down the country. 'He is an accomplished and manipulative con-artist who does not care about the consequences of his actions. 'I appeal to anyone who knows where he is to contact the police immediately so that he can serve his sentence.' His conviction comes two years after being cleared of murdering his wife during their honeymoon to India. Colette Davies, 39, from Bridgend, was found dead at the bottom of a 80ft ravine in a remote part of the country in February 2004. In 2011 he was charged with murder and two counts of fraud, relating to allegations he fraudulently claimed £132,000 from a life insurance policy. In March 2013 he was cleared of all charges at Cardiff Crown Court when the prosecution produced no evidence against him.

Article text: Two Vietnamese citizens and a Canadian have been charged over roles in hacking email service providers in the United States in one of the largest reported data breaches in the nation's history, the Department of Justice said on Friday. Viet Quoc Nguyen, 28, is charged with hacking at least eight email service providers between February 2009 and June 2012 and obtaining more than one billion email addresses. The service providers involved were not named. According to the allegations, Nguyen and fellow Vietnamese citizen Giang Hoang Vu, 25, used the data to send so-called spam to tens of millions of people directing them to products they were selling online. Hacked: The data breach compromised almost one billion email addresses across the United States from February 2009 to June 2012 . Both men resided in the Netherlands. Vu, who was extradited to the United States in March of last year, pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Nguyen remains at large. The other defendant, Canadian David-Manuel Santos Da Silva, 33, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is the co-owner of a company called 21 Celsius Inc, that allegedly struck up a marketing arrangement with Nguyen and Vu to generate revenue and launder the proceeds, according to the Justice Department. The two men made $2 million from sales on those products over two years. “Those individuals who line their pockets with money gained through deceiving others should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable,” said Special Agent in Charge Veronica F. Hyman-Pillot of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. Vu was taken into custody in the Netherlands in 2012 and was extradited to the US at the beginning of March. Arrests: Two men from Vietnam directed spam to Canadian, David-Manuel Santos Da Silva and the three men made more than $2 million . He has pleaded guilty to to conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Da Silva was nabbed by authorities in February at Ft. Lauderdale International Airport trying to leave the country. 'This case reflects the cutting-edge problems posed by today's cybercrime cases, where the hackers didn't target just a single company; they infiltrated most of the country's email distribution firms,' said acting U.S. Attorney John A. Horn. 'And the scope of the intrusion is unnerving, in that the hackers didn't stop after stealing the companies' proprietary data — they then hijacked the companies' own distribution platforms to send out bulk emails and reaped the profits from email traffic directed to specific websites.'

Article text: Four people have been sentenced to death in Tanzania after  brutally murdering a young albino woman in order to harvest her body parts as good luck charms. Zawadi Mangidu, 22, was killed in north-western town of Geita by a group that included her husband, who is among those due to be executed. There is no guarantee the death penalties will ever actually be carried out, however, as the east African nation has had a moratorium on executions for the past 21 years. The conviction comes just days after Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete promised to end a wave of killings of albinos, saying the witchcraft-related murders are shaming Tanzania. Innocent victims: More than 40 albinos have been killed in Tanzania since 2007 - but the government insists it is taking action to end the murders . Activists say attackers have killed at least 75 albinos in Tanzania since 2000 to use their body parts in rituals. 'We will not allow things to escalate as they did in previous years,' Kikwete said in a national address on Monday. 'I believe that with close cooperation between the government and society, we will succeed in ending these killings of persons with albinism and rid our nation of this shame.' There are about 200,000 albinos in Tanzania, most of them easily recognisable as they lack pigment in their skin, eyes and hair. Witch doctors often tell clients that albino body parts will bring them luck in love, life and business. Similar beliefs exist in other African societies, but activists say attacks on albinos are particularly prevalent in Tanzania, where one in every 1,400 people is affected, compared with one in 20,000 in the Western world. Activists say attackers have killed at least 75 albinos in Tanzania since 2000 to use their body parts in rituals . At least 50 people died and dozens were hurt in heavy rains and floods in Tanzania's northwest, a senior official said Wednesday. Torrential rains, hail and high winds hit Kahama district in Shinyanga region late on Tuesday, injuring at least 82 people. 'At least 50 people are now confirmed dead,' Shinyanga's regional commissioner, Ally Rufunga said. 'More bodies of victims believed to have been swept by floods were found in the area and others died in hospital while receiving treatment,' he said, updating a previous death toll of 38. A statement from the office of President Jakaya Kikwete expressed his 'shock and extreme grief' at the disaster. Officials said an estimated 3,500 people in the region, a poor farming area south of Lake Victoria and near the Serengeti game reserve, had been affected by the flooding. 'It is a false belief that if someone has the body part of a person with albinism, this will bring success in business, fishing and mining activities. This is what has been fuelling this ongoing evil,' Kikwete said. Tanzanian police on Monday banned a planned demonstration by the Tanzania Albinism Society in the country's commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, citing security reasons. But Kikwete said he had agreed to meet albino leaders next week to discuss possible solutions to the killings. Kikwete said more than 40 albinos have been killed since 2007 but insisted that his government was taking action to end the murders. He did give details on how the government would stop the killings. The murders have been concentrated in gold-rich regions and fishing communities surrounding the country's Lake Victoria area where superstitious beliefs are rampant. Activists say most attacks are not reported to the police.

Article text: An Australian woman who contracted a life-threatening infection after a breast implant procedure at a Thai hospital, later requiring a partial double mastectomy, said she was 'butchered' by cosmetic surgeons. Ms O'Keefe chose a $7,500 cosmetic surgery tourism package  as a reward to herself after losing 35kg and her breasts appearing 'like pancakes'. She said she was told she was going to have 'the best time of her life'. But Ms O'Keefe said she was shocked at the result of the operation. 'I've been absolutely butchered,' she said. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Courtney O'Keefe (pictured) contracted a life-threatening infection after a breast implant procedure at a Thai hospital, later requiring a double mastectomy, said she was 'butchered' by cosmetic surgeons. With implants: Courtney O'Keefe is pictured here, with her implants, after spending more than six months in hospital for a deadly infection. Ms O'Keefe has since had the implants removed and a double mastectomy, but still has a long path of reconstructive surgery ahead . After they were taken out: This picture shows Ms O'Keefe's breasts after her implants were extracted from her body. She will receive re-constructive surgery from the Cosmetic Institute in Sydney, who have stumped up to assist her . Ms O'Keefe is pictured here following her double mastectomy, holding both of her implants in each hand. The implants were removed on December 17. Ms O'Keefe has not worked since she was struck down by the infection . Ms O'Keefe said she was in 'agony' upon returning to Australia and her mother whisked her to hospital shortly after she arrived back home in Perth. 'We went straight to Armidale Emergency,' she said. 'I was there for 5 minutes and she admitted me up to a room. 'I was in an isolation room becaues they didnt have any clue what I had... They swabbed, and it took four days to figure out what it was.' It was the beginning of a six month ordeal, with Ms O'Keefe spending time at both Armidale and Fremantle hospitals. She was diagnosed with the rare bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, which the Centre for Disease Control said is often contracted by patients in hospital, particularly those with wounds from surgery or hooked up to medical devices. Ms O'Keefe is pictured here after her stay in hospital, when she still had implants . Her condition worsened. 'It was also turning septic and was starting to shut down my liver, my kidneys, my heart, my brain,' she said. 'Mum and Dad had to come and say goodbye to me twice,' said Ms O'Keefe. Doctors called in respected specialists to treat the condition, and they concocted a special substance to fight it. A PIC (peripherally inserted central catheter) was installed inside her so she could receive a constant stream of antibiotics. On December 17, 2014, nearly a year after her ordeal, surgeons removed her implants because the infection had returned. Because the infection had spread to her surrounding tissue, both her breasts were also removed. 'I will never be able to life a normal life': Ms O'Keefe is pictured following the surgery to remove both of her breasts . But her ordeal is not completely over. Ms O'Keefe has suffered kidney and liver problems because of the medication required to treat her infection. She told Daily Mail Australia she had coughed up blood and that doctors said she may require surgery if she does not improve. She lost her job and has not worked since the ordeal began. She had to move back in with her mother. And she's devastated. 'I'm never going to live a normal life,' she said. Ms O'Keefe urged Australians examining plastic surgery overseas to reconsider. 'Someone said it to me a couple of weeks ago. If you wouldn't drink the water there why the hell would you have surgery there. That's so true. So true.' Ms O'Keefe will undergo reconstructive surgery at the Cosmetic Institute in Sydney.

I was up against the goalpost smoking because I had Jaap in front of me. He was  big, strong, quick, unbelievably quick. This guy was quick on half a yard, three yards, 20 yards, 50 yards. Jaap Stam lifts the Premier League trophy as he had a very successful year alongside Schmeichel . DEFENDER: STEVE BRUCE . He was there when I arrived at Manchester United. He was a really good friend. I ended up living next door to him, so he looked after me and my family. I've never played with a player so brave. He was never quick. He was slow, but unbelievable. He could read the game. He was never, ever, ever scared to sacrifice himself in order to do one tiny little thing for the good of the team. DEFENDER: DENIS IRWIN . What can you say about Denis Irwin that hasn't been said before? Doing this team I'm thinking about as a defender you'd remember what mistakes they made. I couldn't come up with a single mistake. So dependable, so reliable. His personality was really, really good for the back four of the team because we had so many outspoken personalities. He would be the guy in between. Set pieces. Fantastic shooting technique, and he would score goals from open play as well. Not many full-backs do that. Former Manchester United player Steve Bruce (left) features in the goalkeeper's best XI he played with . MIDFIELDER: DAVID BECKHAM . What David Beckham has done with his life, people will remember him for that. I hope people won't forget how good a player he was. Not only was he a good player but he is the one guy with the best kicking technique I've ever seen in my life. That came from talent to begin with. Hard work. He was one of the guys who took lessons off what Eric Cantona did. Doing stuff on your own for instance. No-one did that at Manchester United. David Beckham never cut a corner. He got his rewards. MIDFIELDER: ROY KEANE . A person of many different things but for 90 minutes when we played football this guy was unbelievable. I can't remember anyone who had the energy to run box to box, or 120 if it went to extra time. Keep doing the same thing, keep doing the same thing. Driving everybody to do the same. In his prime he was probably one of the best midfield players in the world. MIDFIELDER: PAUL SCHOLES . When I came to United he was a kid back then, playing in the youth team, but he was a striker. You could see there was something very special about him. His technique was incredible. He was converted into a midfield player. Scholes's passes, any kind of distance, from one yard to 40 yards, they were always accurate. Roy Keane (from left to right), David Beckham and Ryan Giggs all make it from Schmeichel's United days . MIDFIELDER: RYAN GIGGS . We know the goal he scored in the semi-final against Arsenal. Unbelievable thing to do. It's been shown time and time again because it is the best goal ever scored in the FA Cup. From 16 years of age to this year, to be able to perform at that level, to give the team so much, this guy has got to be the best Premier League player of all time. What he has given Manchester United and what he still gives Manchester United is fantastic. MIDFIELDER: MICHAEL LAUDRUP . Probably the best player I've ever played with. It's a shame he hasn't played in this country but this is a guy who played in one of the best Barcelona teams ever. He made the journey to Madrid, and played in one of the best Madrid teams ever. Won everything that football has to offer. STRIKER: ERIC CANTONA . The king. Changed everything for us. We had one season in 95 we were struggling. We really, really didn't play the way we should. This guy just changed everything. A different approach to games. Unbelievable. Schmeichel has chosen Michael Laudrup (left) as the best ever player he played alongside at Brondby .

Article text: Passengers and crew faced mid-air panic on board an Air Europa charter flight after several travellers fainted while en route to Tel Aviv from Barcelona, according to reports. After landing at Ben Gurion Airport this morning passengers told Israeli media that flight attendants were 'hysterical', there was a strong smell of 'gas' in the cabin during the four-hour journey, and 10 people lost consciousness. One passenger told Israeli news website Ynet: ‘They did not let people get up in the bathroom because they were afraid more people would faint.’ Passengers told Israeli media that 10 people fainted during an Air Europa flight from Barcelona to Tel Aviv . In a statement, an Air Europa spokesperson said passengers were feeling dizzy, but did not faint, after noticing a smell that was believed to be kerosene, which powers the jet's engines. The spokesperson said: 'Around 6 people had temporary indisposition this morning travelling from Barcelona to Tel Aviv on flight Air Europa UX433. 'All of them have recovered quickly by drinking a cola drink. All passengers left the aircraft on their own at destination.' Almost 200 passengers and crew were on board the Boeing 737, leased from a company called Flying Carpet, when the situation unfolded. A passenger named Hilla told Ynet that people on board smelled 'gas' after the pilot started the engines while preparing for take-off in Barcelona. She said she complained to cabin crew but was told that everything was 'OK' and not to worry. An hour later, passengers began to lose consciousness, causing people on board to panic, she claimed. Over the plane’s tannoy a flight attendant reportedly asked if there was a doctor on board to assess the passengers. An Air Europa passenger said people splashed water on her to wake her up after she fainted (file photo) One woman who fainted regained consciousness after water was poured on her, but said she soon lost consciousness a second time after feeling dizzy. She told Ynet that she began to feel weak after the person sitting next to her adjusted the air conditioning control above their seat. The woman said: ‘[They] woke me up with water, and after a few minutes I passed out again. 'Stewards were under pressure … and [would] not even let us go to the bathroom.’ The Air Europa spokesperson said there is 'no gas of any type' on the new generation of Boeing 737 aircraft, so the smell perceived by some passengers came from jet fuel. The spokesperson said: ‘The smell of kerosene that some people perceived during flight is normal when the engines are started with headwind, but after short period of time that smell is always removed by the air conditioning system.’ The spokesperson said no emergency was declared and the flight landed as scheduled. An official from Israel's Ministry of Transport said Spanish authorities are investigating. A spokesman for Israel Airports Authority told MailOnline Travel that he was not made aware of any incident on board the plane. He said the flight crew did not say anything about ill passengers while communicating with air traffic controllers. Air Europa is Spain’s third largest airline, with its headquarters located in Mallorca.

Article text: Nick Clegg (above) launched an outspoken pre-election attack on the Tories, who he has spent five years sharing power with . Nick Clegg today launched an outspoken pre-election attack on the Tories he has spent five years sharing power with. The Lib Dem leader used his final conference speech before polling day to mock the 'red-faced bluster of right-wing Tories', compare David Cameron to 'Nigel Farage in White tie', and declare: 'Cows moo. Dogs bark. And Tories cut.' In a desperate plea to be returned to power after May 7, he warned the Tories would not be fair and Labour would ruin the economy. Addressing delegates in Liverpool, Mr Clegg urged his party to 'think big', hailing Britain as an 'open-hearted, open-minded, optimistic country'. Mr Clegg, who was joined on stage by his wife Miriam, said there was nowhere in the world like the UK 'nowhere as gutsy, nowhere as hopeful, nowhere as welcoming'. 'We are a small island, but we are a big, big country,' he added. But he warned this was threatened by Labour and the Conservatives abandoning the centre ground. After years of austerity, he insisted there was now 'light at the end of the tunnel'. 'While the job of fixing our economy is not over yet, the end is in sight.' He said austerity could end in three years' time, but claimed that the Tories wanted to continue cutting public spending far beyond what was necessary. He claimed that 'everywhere you look there is blame and division', including Ukip pandering to fear and Tory Home Secretary Theresa May sending out vans telling migrants to 'Go Home'. And he took aim at the Chancellor, with whom he has spent the last week negotiating the details of Wednesday's Budget. Wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez (left) and women's minister Jo Swinson (right) listen to the speech . In the speech Clegg claimed that 'everywhere you look there is blame and division', including Ukip pandering to fear and Tory Home Secretary Theresa May sending out vans telling migrants to 'Go Home' He pointed to the 'glint in George Osborne's eye as he announced that the working age poor will bear the brunt of the cuts'. He launched the direct attack on his coalition partners by claiming they posed a  threat to education by refusing to protect pre-school and college funding. 'Cows moo. Dogs bark. And Tories cut. It's in their DNA,' he said. The Lib Dems and Tories have clashed over Mr Osborne's plan to rule out any future tax rises and tackle the deficit through cuts alone, including taking another £12billion out of the welfare budget. Mr Clegg claimed this would mean eight million families on the lowest wages would be £1,500 worse off. He said the Tories had refused to target the wealthy, describing them as 'their friends in big business and big houses'. 'They're not even pretending they want us to be "all in this together" any more. 'The Conservative plan for the next government is an ideological lurch to the right. 'They have gone from being the self-proclaimed heirs to Blair to Nigel Farage in white tie. 'And yet they have the gall to say they are staying on the road to recovery. 'They are not staying on the road, they are veering off it.' Ms Gonzalez Durantez hugged her husband before joining him on stage after the keynote speech . Clegg, pictured with Ms Gonzalez Durantez after the speech, also turned his fire on the Labour Party, claiming the most interesting thing they have done is 'buy a pink van' A Lib Dem delegate falls asleep clutching a pile of leaflets during the opening of the session this morning . He said Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne cannot have it both ways, claiming the government has done the right thing and then calling for drastic changes. 'Either we are doing the right thing or we aren't. If we are then why won't you stick with it? 'I'll tell you why: because left to their own devices the Conservatives will cut public services, take away support from the poor and look after their own kind in a way they haven't been able to do in this Government because we were there to stop them.' He also turned his fire on the Labour Party, claiming the most interesting they have done is 'buy a pink van'. He said Ed Miliband's pledge card to voters, launched yesterday, contained £70billion of extra borrowing. 'It's not a pledge card, it's a credit card and you, me and every other British taxpayer will be paying the bill for years to come.' He warned the liberal values of modern Britain would be under threat if either the Tories or Labour attempted to govern with the support of a 'rag tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the SNP. Despite dire polls suggesting Lib Dems could lose more than half of their seats, Mr Clegg insisted his party was 'here to stay'. The Lib Dem leader walks with his wife  ahead of his keynote speech on the final day of the party's spring conference in Liverpool . He ruled out being part of a formal coalition deal involving either the SNP or Ukip, although aides would not reject the idea of those parties being involved in a looser confidence and supply arrangement. The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'Just like we would not put Ukip in charge of Europe, we are not going to put the SNP in charge of Britain - a country they want to rip apart. It's just not going to happen.' He insisted: 'Only the Liberal Democrats will keep Britain on track and govern for the whole country. 'We have shown that we are prepared to put the national interest first, even if it means taking a hit to our short-term popularity. 'And we will continue to put the national interest first. If others won't stand up to the growing mood of divisive populism, we will.' After the speech Clegg, who ruled out entering a coalition with SNP or Ukip after the election, raised his arms in the air . He said the story of the next five years must be one of hope. 'If you are thinking of voting Conservative but are worried that they won't be fair – don't do it. 'If you are thinking of voting Labour but are worried they will ruin the economy – don't do it. 'If you think a vote for UKIP, or the Greens, or the SNP is harmless – it isn't. 'If you want a stable government that won't lurch to the extremes of left or right, you have to vote for it. 'If you want a stronger economy and a fairer society, you have to vote for it. 'If you want a government that will create opportunities for everyone, vote Liberal Democrat. 'This is a fight for our future, for the decent values of our country – we can and we must win.'

Article text: Grayson Perry's unusual Gingerbread House holiday home has been branded an 'abomination' by local villagers inundated with art fans flocking to see the property. The Turner Prize-winning artist teamed up with the organisation Living Architecture to design the unique holiday cottage in the sleepy village of Wrabness. But locals - who battled the original plans - claim art fans flocking to catch a glimpse of the artist's creation are clogging up the narrow streets. Scroll down for video . The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie' The quirky cottage was supposed to 'explore the special character and unique qualities of Essex' and is expected to open for holiday bookings in the spring. But the local council has already been forced to redesign surrounding roads and car parks to accommodate the influx of art fans. One frustrated villager, who refused to be named, said: 'This is a tiny village known for its tranquillity. 'We're not a snotty London art gallery, yet our tiny roads are now besieged on a daily basis by day trippers asking for directions to the dreaded 'Gingerbread House'. 'I can only imagine how bad it will be in the summer. 'I still do not understand how this abomination got planning permission in the first place?' Wrabness Parish Council strongly objected to the proposal to knock down the existing farmhouse and replace it with the imposing structure that combines sculptures, tapestries and ceramics. Villagers in Wrabness have said that Grayson Perry's 'Gingerbread house' has caused traffic chaos . The Turner Prize-winning artist is known primarily for his work with ceramics, and right, the house in honour to a mythical Essex woman called 'Julie' The original plans for the home were turned down by Tendring District Council but a re-submitted application for the wacky home was given the green-light by planners. The finished work - which can be seen from miles around - includes ceramic tiles featuring safety pins, old-style tapes, hearts and the word 'Julie'. Perry admitted he had originally designed the house whilst ‘doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the television’. The house is located on the banks of the River Stour, in the rural village of Wrabness . He wanted it to resemble a ‘jewel box’ that told the story of a mythical Essex woman called Julie, who had a difficult childhood, love life, divorce and late career. Hence, there’s an 8ft statue of her on the roof, naked and pregnant, and her name is emblazoned all over the walls. Essex County Council Highways Authority have now agreed to redesign tiny local roads to improve access to the site. Talks are also ongoing to use the nearby Wrabness Railway Station as a car park for art enthusiasts. The cottage - officially named 'A House for Essex' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months . An Essex Highways spokesman said: 'Following a meeting, it was agreed to implement a number of requests for road improvements in Black Boy Lane, Wrabness. 'These include a variety of new and replacement road signs and renewed and repositioned road markings. 'Cllrs Bass and Johnson also agreed to write to NCP and National Rail to encourage them to discuss parking issues with the parish council.' The cottage - officially named 'A House for Essex' - is set to open to holidaymakers in the next few months. Grayson Perry was contacted for comment but has yet to respond.

Article text: An estimated one in five people will suffer with depression in their lifetime. But scientists have now found that Macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans, such as shying away from a group, losing their appetite and adopting a hunched posture. By studying creatures in a social situation, they hope to learn more about why humans may become depressed, which could improve treatment for the debilitating mental disorder. Scientists have found that Macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans, such as shying away from a group (shown in E) and adopting a hunched posture (shown at A, B, D and E). Image C suggests bullying from dominant monkeys (marked in the pictures with red arrows) in the form of a cut to the monkey's ear. Intimidating behaviour (B and D) may explain the monkeys' depression . Previous studies have used rodents, which 'do not realistically resemble the etiopathological [causal] development of depression, which occurs naturally in a social context,’ according to the study, published in Nature. Researchers at Chongqing Medical University, China, and Wake Forest University in North Carolina, examined depression in cynomolgus macaque monkeys living in social colonies at Zhongke Experimental Animal Co. in Suzhou, eastern China. The cause of depression in some cases, appears to be down to bullying behaviour by dominant members of the colonies, such as intimidating and even attacking lower status monkeys. Each colony was made up of two males and approximately 20 females as well as their offspring, reflecting how they would live in the wild. Twenty females showing symptoms of depression, such as no interest in food, grooming or mating. Dominant behaviour is marked with red arrows, above and depressed monkeys with blue arrows. Feeding: The depressed monkeys spent less time eating and drinking than their healthy peers. Behaviour: They spent less time resting on elevated perches such as shelves and hanging chains, which are favourites with healthier and more dominant monkeys. Movement: Depressed subjects spent more time sitting on the floor and less time walking around. Grooming: The sad monkeys spent less time grooming each other and being groomed, which is a sign of sociability in healthy monkeys. They also spent less time taking care of themselves, by scratching, for example. Nursing: They also nursed their infants less than healthy monkeys. A total of 52 colonies were observed and 1,007 female monkeys screened for depression, Real Clear Science reported. Twenty females showing symptoms of depression, such as no interest in food, grooming or mating, were chosen and compared to 20 ‘happy’ monkeys and 10 that had been kept in isolation and were also thought to be depressed. The researchers found that the naturally depressed and isolated monkeys behaved in a similar way, such as ‘stereotypical prostrated and socially unresponsive posture as well as exacerbation of socially submissive behaviours,’ the study said. Naturally depressed monkeys  displayed a slumped posture, less interest in feeding and sex and diminished communication and reciprocal grooming with others. 'One to two subjects per stable social colony (17–22 subjects) manifested a depressive phenotype that may be attributed to psychosocial stress,’ the study said. The authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops than humans (illustrated with a stock image) than rodent models . As well as behavioural changes, they also identified metabolic differences between depressed and healthy monkeys, which has also been witnessed in humans. The healthy monkeys spent longer feeding and drinking compared to their depressed peers who were not as interested in eating, for example. The authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops in humans than rodent models. ‘This model's stable depression phenotype demonstrates superior validity to traditional rodent models of depression by better approximating the psychosocial stressors encountered by adult humans living in a resource-based competitive society and can aid further investigation into the mechanisms underlying depression,’ they wrote.

Article text: Andy Murray goes into his next match at the Miami Open against Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo on Sunday, but his Great Britain Davis Cup colleague James Ward has had to fly home to rest a sore knee. Ward, the British No 2, has paid a high price for his heroic win over John Isner in Glasgow earlier this month, having lost three first rounds subsequently, and now finds himself out of action for two weeks. He was due to play in Guadeloupe next week but instead has gone back to London, where he eventually hopes to be able to begin preparation for next month’s clay court events, once his knee has settled down. Andy Murray is gearing up for a Miami Open clash with Colombia's Santiago Giraldo on Sunday . James Ward has had to return to England to rest his sore knee, and won't play in Guadeloupe as planned . Giraldo, Murray's Miami Open opponent on Sunday, is number 31 in the world rankings . Murray, who plays Colombia’s world No 31 Giraldo in the third round on Sunday, expects to team up with Ward this summer at Queen’s Club for the Davis Cup quarter-final against France. With the newly-extended three-week gap between the French Open and Wimbledon, it will mean six weeks of high profile grass court tennis in the UK, and Murray feels the longer run-in after Paris will help him. ‘I think it’s better for me if there are more weeks on grass,’ he said. ‘A lot of the players will go and spend a week at home after Roland Garros whereas for me I can easily practise on grass, for a lot of the players it’s not easy to get on grass courts.’
