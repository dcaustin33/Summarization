David Naylor, 56, from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, is facing two counts of manslaughter by gross negligence.
He appeared at Guildford Crown Court and is due stand trial in September.
His lawyer have indicated he would enter not guilty pleas when he next appears at the same court on 11 March.
The company which manufactured the doors involved in the incident has been summonsed for breaches of duty imposed by the Health and Safety at Work Act.
Express Hi-Fold Doors Limited, of which Mr Naylor is a director, is accused of failing to ensure equipment was safe.
Mr Grills, from Port Isaac in Cornwall, and Mr McMullen, from Disley in Cheshire, were at the venue ahead of a performance due to be staged by the 10-piece group.

Higgins features for the sixth time, and victory would take him second in the all-time list of ranking title wins on 29 - seven behind compatriot Stephen Hendry.
The 41-year-old, who has won three non-ranking events this season and beat Selby 18-13 a decade ago, added: "Mark will not go below a certain level, so I need to play better.
"I know what I need to do in the last, massive game to end the season.
"I am trying to stay focused and give it my all against the number one player in the world. Winning it would be my biggest achievement, without a doubt."

Englishman Selby is attempting to become only the fourth player - after Hendry, Steve Davis and Ronnie O'Sullivan - to win consecutive world titles in the modern era.
He overcame a stern test against China's Ding, who he beat to claim his second crown in Sheffield 12 months ago.
The Leicester player has been in supreme form this season, winning four ranking titles and reaching the Shanghai Masters final.
Selby said: "It will be a fantastic occasion. I played in my first final 10 years ago against the same opponent and here we are on the 40th anniversary.
"John is a great player, one of the greats of the game. He has had a fantastic season and is in the final again. It will be another tough match for me.
"If he wins another world title, he will be equal with Ronnie O'Sullivan on five victories so he is trying to created history himself."
Former world champion John Parrott on BBC TV:
If there is one player whose game matches up to Mark Selby, who can match him in the safety and tactical departments, it is the man in the final with him - John Higgins.
The Scot is a consummate match player, we have all been there and played him and know what problems he causes his opponents. Higgins will be up for the fight.

If the full-size 55-seat plane is then approved, the first passengers could be travelling at supersonic speeds across the Atlantic by 2023.
Rolls-Royce warns against 'hard Brexit'
Boeing launches new version of 737 jet
Airbus unveils upgraded A380 jumbo
Blake Scholl, the founder and chief executive of Boom, said at the Paris air show that the design of the XB-1 demonstration plane had passed a performance and safety review ahead of manufacturing.
Boom said five unnamed airlines had placed 76 orders for its passenger plane, which resembles Concorde but has a delta wing that sweeps almost to the tip of the nose.
It will also ditch the afterburner engine used by the British-French supersonic pioneer that was not only extremely loud but also very thirsty.
"By using a modern turbofan engine like Boeing and Airbus, you can make the aircraft both quieter and significantly more fuel efficient," Mr Scholl told the BBC.
The company claims that airlines flying its plane will be able to charge similar prices to a business class fare on the lucrative London-New York route of about $5,000 return.
Concorde tickets used to cost up to about three times that amount.
Time-poor travellers, meanwhile, will jump at the chance of getting to or from those two cities in about half the time a subsonic plane takes, according to Boom.
"Airlines are excited for something new and different to offer their passengers," Mr Scholl said.
Although Concorde had the backing of both the British and French governments, he said it was not economic because the imperative then was to beat the Soviet Union into the supersonic age, rather than build a practical or affordable plane.
"Being a private company that has to raise investment means we have to have a business case that is profitable for airlines and affordable for customers," Mr Scholl said.
Although many remain sceptical that Boom can deliver its promises, the company said in March that it had raised the $33m that would allow it to build and fly the demonstration plane.
One believer in the project is Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson, who announced late last year that he planned to buy the first 10 passenger jets made by Boom.
His Virgin Galactic space travel venture will also provide manufacturing and engineering services, as well as flight test support.

Article text: when the investigator becomes a bigger story than the investigation.
Such was the case with Congressman Devin Nunes, with his shifting explanations for where and how he acquired sensitive intelligence documents, his decision to keep details from his fellow intelligence committee members, his apparent behind-the-scenes co-ordination with White House sources and his penchant for dramatic press conferences.
All this made him a liability for Republican congressional leadership and the White House. Now he is, at least temporarily, out of the picture.
He may blame an ethics complaint filed by "leftwing activist groups" for forcing the move, but there's little doubt that many Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief. Mr Nunes, at times, seemed out of his depth on the big political stage.
The committee's investigations effectively had been ground to a halt by partisan bickering, and this move is a first step toward rebooting the efforts.
It may be too late, however, as the concurrent Senate intelligence committee investigation has launched more smoothly and with a greater show of bipartisan co-operation.
Members of the House of Representatives often complain of being viewed as the "baby brother" to the upper chamber. The dual Russia probes haven't done much to dispel that notion.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said he fully supported Mr Nunes' decision.
Mr Ryan said he trusts Mr Nunes, but the ehtics inquiry "would be a distraction" for the House Intelligence Committee investigation.
Representative Adam Schiff, a ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he respected Mr Nunes' decision.
"We have a fresh opportunity to move forward in the unified and nonpartisan way that an investigation of this seriousness demands," he added.
A White House spokesman said in response to the announcement: "This is an internal matter for the House".
Texas Representative Mike Conaway will take over that inquiry with the help of fellow Republicans Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney.
"We're going to proceed with the investigation and follow every lead to its logical conclusion," Mr Conaway said on Thursday.
It is unclear whether Mr Nunes' departure will end the partisan bickering that has brought the committee's investigation to a virtual halt.
But a separate Senate Intelligence Committee probe into Russia's alleged role in the US election appeared to be moving forward, conducting its first round of hearings on the issue last week.
Meanwhile, the FBI also recently acknowledged it is running its own probe into claims of Kremlin political meddling.
Mr Nunes said he plans to return to the House investigation, but he did not provide a timeline.

"The board had a range of governance measures in place, but this was not sufficient and the risk to the organisation was underestimated at the time.
"While the ultimate responsibility for spending public money lies with the accountable officer, the contractual flaws were part of a systemic failing involving a variety of people."

Article text: short-term contract on Thursday, three days after Neil Redfearn's dismissal.
Kevin Blackwell, who has worked with Warnock since 1986, will join him at Rotherham as assistant coach.
"This is the 14th time I've retired and my 15th comeback, but I do enjoy it," Warnock told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"I didn't expect to be here this time last week, but that's football. I've never been a manager just to do things for the sake of it.
"I was probably the best bet for them - my wife hasn't been so well but she told me to go for it, and that's what I'm going to do."
Rotherham are 22nd in the table and without a win in five games, and Warnock's primary task is to save them from relegation.
"I'm only here for 12 weeks and I'm not going to change everything in 12 weeks. I need to get results as soon as possible," he said.
"I think when I finish football, the fans will remember that when I've left a club, I don't think I leave them in worse-off situations.
"They all have memories of what I've done and enjoyment, and that's what football is about, not falling asleep watching your team play."
The 67-year-old has been without a managerial role since December, when he left Queens Park Rangers after a spell as temporary boss.
"We know it is going to be difficult, but there will be some players at Rotherham now who will really give me satisfaction," he added.
"They are a genuine bunch - there's no bad eggs as far as I can see. The club is the most important thing and we all have to be singing off the same hymn sheet."

Article text: groups say more than a dozen media employees have been killed in Sri Lanka over the past decade.
None of the murders has been solved.
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo says Mr Shauketaly was on the phone to a colleague at the Sunday Leader on Friday evening at his home in Mount Lavinia when the call was cut.
Shortly afterwards he answered a call and said he had been shot in the neck by three intruders, who had then escaped.
A group of foreign lodgers at his house said he was covered in blood and calling for help.
Mr Shauketaly, 52, was taken to intensive care, where doctors pronounced him out of danger and have been working to remove a bullet.
Mr Shauketaly holds British and Sri Lankan passports and the UK government has called on the authorities to bring the attackers to justice.
Our correspondent says Mr Shauketaly had voiced fears that his investigative reporting might be putting him in danger, especially after strangers had called at his house recently asking for his whereabouts.
Four years ago, the Sunday Leader's editor, Lasantha Wickrematunge, was shot dead by a group of masked men on motorbikes.
The case, which has never been solved, highlighted the dismal state of press freedom in the country, analysts said.
"There has been a range of attacks in Sri Lanka on journalists, civil society organisations and others in recent years. To date, too many incidents have had little investigation and no resolution," UK Foreign Office Minister Alastair Burt said in a statement.
The Sunday Leader had long had a reputation for being outspokenly anti-government.
Its profile changed last year when it was bought by a well-connected businessman and retracted some of its articles, but it still does a considerable amount of investigative reporting.
Last month, Sri Lanka was placed 162nd out of 179 in a Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders.

Pele added: "Only God is more important than my health. In my life, I've had fractures, surgeries, pain, hospital stays, victories and defeats. And I've always respected those who admire me."
The former Santos player added that it was his "own decision".
Pele's spokesman Pepito Fornos added: "He is walking with a cane. The problem is that if he sits in a chair you need a winch to get him out of it.
"His doctor thought it best that he continues physiotherapy, that he rests and we hope that he will be able to appear at the [Olympic] closing ceremony."
Earlier this week, Pele said he was asked to light the cauldron by the organisers, however he had "an international commitment with an English company". The former footballer added that if he could change his travel plans it would be an "honour" to carry out the task.
In June, Pele was awarded the Olympic Order by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) - the movement's highest honour.
He was named "Athlete of the  century" by the IOC in 1999 despite never competing at a Games because professional players were barred from doing so during his playing days.
Pele, who won his first World Cup winner's medal at the age of 17, is regarded by many as the greatest footballer of all time.
Since retiring in 1977, he has taken up ambassadorial roles both in and outside football, and was involved in politics as minister of sport in his home country for a three-year period from 1995.
And in 2012 Pele was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh for his "significant contribution to humanitarian and environmental causes", having worked as a United Nations ambassador for ecology and the environment.
Earlier on Friday, hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads in Copacabana - protesting against the government and the cost of hosting the event - which resulted in a change of route for the Olympic torch relay.
The Olympic torch began its final journey to the Maracana beneath the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue that overlooks Rio.

Delhi-based environmental think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said in its report that it had collected 38 bread and bakery samples from retail stores, bakeries and fast-food shops in Delhi for its study.
"More than 84% of samples tested were found to contain potassium bromate and/or iodate," it said.
The CSE has urged the government to ban the use of these chemicals in bakery products.
"Considering that it [potassium bromate] can cause cancer, is banned in most parts of the world, and has healthy alternatives, there is no reason why this chemical should be allowed, specifically when residues are found to be present in the end-product."
The CSE said potassium iodate should also be banned because "it can potentially affect the functioning of thyroid".
The bread manufacturers' association said it was yet to see the CSE report, but added that the two additives were safe and "widely used in advanced countries like the US".
"Food Safety and Standards Authority of India's regulations permit the use of potassium bromate and/or potassium iodate at 50 ppm max for bread and at 20 ppm max for bakery purpose," the association said in a statement.

However, speaking to BBC Wales Sport, Jenkins said the club did not suspect the former Barcelona and Real Madrid player of any wrongdoing.
"There were discussions with the LMA but that was done in the context of negotiating a settlement and it should be taken in that light," he added.
"As far as we are concerned that is the end of the matter and we agreed a settlement and we move on."
Tutumlu has represented Laudrup since the 52-year-old played for Barcelona from 1989 to 1994.
According to the Politiken article, the documents show Jenkins signed an agreement which would give Tutumlu 7.5% of the net profit from all player sales when Laudrup extended his contract in March 2013.
Tutumlu has yet to respond to BBC Wales Sport's request for comment, but Jenkins says that particular clause never came into effect.
"On that particular point it was never acted upon and as most people know transfers in and out of the club are controlled and decided by myself, always in conjunction with the manager," he added.
"But ultimately we had the control and from that date to Michael's departure in 2014 that point in particular was never active.
"All I can say as far as I am concerned is we dealt with everything in the right way as we saw it and in good faith."

King called the decision "unfair" but thought she was unable to appeal against the decision because she was not on British Cycling's funded programme.
However, British Cycling's interim performance manager Andy Harrison subsequently announced she could.
"I have really enjoyed being on the road this year and I feel I've exceeded all expectations in terms of my results," said King.
"I was given nine criteria at the start of the year which I've been working toward and I'm absolutely gutted."

King defied expectations by returning to elite racing after a life-threatening training crash in November 2014 left her with eight broken ribs, a bruised liver and punctured lung.
She stopped receiving UK Sport funding two months later and was told she would not be considered for the Rio track cycling team late last year.
She has been focusing exclusively on road racing ever since.
Despite her Olympic omission and the controversies surrounding British Cycling following the departure of technical director Shane Sutton amid claims of sexism and discrimination, King refuses to be too critical of the national set-up.
"When I was on the programme, I was supported really well," she said. "It's just disappointing that I feel like this selection hasn't been fair to me."

The plans include a nature reserve but Ian Hepburn, from Sussex Wildlife Trust, said the development would damage coastal shingle and species there including reptiles, invertebrates, breeding birds and plants.
Former town councillor Rod Main said West Beach had already been closed by the port and this expansion would see the town lose its one other remaining area of sandy beach.
Calling for West Beach to reopen, he added: "This company are just taking away every sandy beach we've got."
A report submitted to Lewes council said the plans would help to regenerate Newhaven and create jobs, and the expansion would provide overspill space for the new Rampion wind farm.
Officers said it was an opportunity to create a modern port, and the benefits outweighed harm such as the loss of sandy beach, impact on surf conditions, and effects on ecology and archaeology.
