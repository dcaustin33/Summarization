Article text: a manufacturing firm in Dumbarton on Friday.
They called in the Scottish SPCA amid concerns that it could be poisonous.
The animal charity contacted an arachnid specialist who helped identify the spider, which can give a painful bite. The Huntsman is being cared for while a suitable home is sought.
Scottish SPCA Animal Rescue Officer Emma Bonner, who dealt with the incident, said: "We were called to a manufacturing business on Stirling Road, Dumbarton, on Friday morning after we received reports of a large spider.
"When I arrived one of the employees had managed to get the spider inside a clear bag within a container. We didn't know if it was venomous."
The spider was passed to Scottish SPCA Ch Insp Fiona Henderson who contacted a specialist.
Ch Insp Henderson said: "An arachnid expert identified it as a Huntsman spider. We believe that due to a yellow stripe on its abdomen that the spider is female.
"It would be hard to say where it is from exactly due to the fact it arrived here in a shipping container.
"It must be a tough little spider as it has done well to survive living in a cold container for so long before arriving in Scotland."
Ch Insp Henderson added: "Because it's a Huntsman it's not native to this country so we can't release the spider anywhere in Scotland.
"If there are any bacteria or bugs that the spider is carrying that we are not aware of then it could introduce those to other species.
"The spider appears in good condition and is already an adult so we are going to try to find a specialist home for it."

Article text: of those affected may receive compensation.
Legal filings indicated that 250,000 people had lost some Â£130m in benefits.
The Court of Appeal suggested the Department for Work and Pensions would owe a mere 1% of that amount, Â£1.3m, to just 2,500 people.
The complex judgment on Friday was originally prompted by a challenge from Cait Reilly, a geology graduate from Birmingham.
She had argued that requiring her to work at Poundland for no pay constituted a breach of her human rights.
The government - to counter such claims - had retrospectively altered the law to validate the docking of benefits.
Today, the Court of Appeal ruled that even under that new revised law, the docking of benefits could be incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights.
The Court's ruling represented a defeat for the government.
Padraig Hughes, of Public Interest Lawyers, the group that brought Ms Reilly's case, said: "It is yet a further example of the reckless approach this Government continues to take towards the constitution and the rule of law."
The Court of Appeal judges did nevertheless acknowledge that government ministers can change laws to affect cases retrospectively.
And the judges decided that the only rights infringed upon where those of people that had already claimed the benefits docking was unfair.
This narrowing of the claimants explains why only a tiny fraction of people will be eligible for a payout.
"We are considering the judgment", a DWP spokesman said. "It is only right that jobseekers do all they can to find work while claiming benefits."
It is not clear yet whether either side will make a further appeal.

Article text: The US Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annualised pace of 1.4% in the January-to-March period.
The rate was an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2%, which itself was an increase from the original reading of 0.7%.
However, it still marks a slowdown from the final quarter of 2016, when the economy grew at a rate of 2.1%.
The latest growth figure was helped by an increased estimate for growth in consumer spending, which was revised up to a rate of 1.1% from 0.6%.
"The economy is expanding at a solid, if unspectacular pace," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.
Growth estimates in the first quarter are often weak, a quirk some say is due to the difficulty of measuring the effect of seasonal changes.
Thursday's update bolsters the perspective of the Federal Reserve, which increased interest rates in June.
Policymakers at the time said they did not believe the slowdown in the first quarter was the start of a trend, pointing to one-off factors, including a relatively mild winter.
Stronger-than-expected trade figures published Wednesday also led some to predict better growth in the second quarter.
Even so, many say growth for the year is all but certain to fall short of the 3% goal outlined by US President Donald Trump. Mr Faucher forecasts growth around 2.2% for the year.
The International Monetary Fund this week cut its forecast for US economic growth, in part citing uncertainty over the chances for tax reform and infrastructure spending, policies that many say could provide an economic boost.

Article text: The Asian Hornet has spread across Europe since being accidentally introduced to France in 2004 in a shipment of pottery from China.
The UK's National Bee Unit confirmed one of the hornets had been photographed in Jersey.
Beekeeper Bob Hogge said he expected more to arrive on the island.
Mr Hogge, from the Jersey Beekeepers' Association, said: "I think I could put a very safe bet that we will have them here within the next few years.
"They surround us now, they're on the Brittany coast, they're on the Normandy coast - we will get them", he said.
A nest of Asian Hornets found in Alderney in July was destroyed as a precaution against them spreading, the Alderney government said.
In Jersey, an amateur insect expert who photographed it at Mount Bingham, Jersey's environment department said.
The department said the area had been searched and no further hornet activity detected.
People who suspect they have found a hornet should send a photograph to the department if it is safe to do so, a spokesman said.
Mr Hogge said the Asian Hornet dismembered honey bees to take back to feed their young and could wipe out entire hives.
"They've got a particularly unpleasant sting, and they are aggressive. If one attacks you and leaves a sting it will leave a scent and others will come and attack you too," he added.
However, the department stressed the Asian hornet was no more harmful to humans than the European hornet.

It follows other landslips earlier in the year caused by winter storms.
The Jurassic Coast World Heritage team urged visitors to pay heed to warning signs and avoid "putting yourself or others at risk" by venturing close to the bottom of cliffs.
Drone pictures taken by local photographer James Loveridge show debris from the sandstone cliff spread out on the beach below.
Sam Scriven, earth science manager for the Jurassic Coast World Heritage team, said the cliffs were being monitored.
"As ever, keep your wits about you, whether you are out walking, fossil hunting, having a picnic or taking selfies.
"Always stay away from top and bottom of cliffs. Landslides and rock falls can, and do, happen anytime. Never ignore a warning sign - they are there for your safety."
Bridport Harbour also posted a warning on Facebook.
It said: "These can happen at anytime and without warning. Stay a safe distance away from the bottom of the cliffs."

Article text: a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September.
Experts from McKenzie Intelligence Services were brought in to assist Suffolk Police after Â£51,000 was raised through an online crowdfunding page.
Forbes McKenzie said his team would add "clarity" to the investigation.
What do we know about Corrie Mckeague's disappearance?
He said: "Our mission is to create clarity from the huge amount of data that has emerged.
"We think the phone is a key piece of information.
"Where the phone finished is indicative of where Corrie was last.
"I'm very interested in what other phones were co-located with Corrie's phone."
Mr McKenzie, whose company is based in London, said he had three specialists, including himself, working on the case.
He stressed his team was "not running a parallel investigation" to Suffolk Police but was there to "add value" to what the force was doing.
The team's first task would be to collate all of the information available on social media feeds, CCTV and areas that have and have not been searched, he said.
"We are plugging the gaps that Suffolk Police just doesn't have the people power to do.
"This investigation might prove to be the very first crowdfunded and crowd-data sourced investigation," Mr McKenzie added.
About 5,000 people pledged support to the crowdfunding page after the family of Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, expressed concerns about the police investigation.
The RAF Honington gunner was last seen at about 03:25 BST walking alone in the Suffolk town.
A second public search for Mr Mckeague will take place on 22 January. More than 60 volunteers joined in the first on 17 December.

Article text: to become Scottish party leader. That's more than half the Labour team at Holyrood.
Many of them would like her elected unopposed.
Yet when she announced her intention to stand, Ms Dugdale said she would "absolutely" welcome a contest.
Ken MacIntosh is offering that challenge.
He is likely to require the support of six or seven MSPs to become a candidate. But he claims his supporters are being "bullied and intimidated" by what he calls the "party machine" in an attempt to avoid a contest.
He has not been more specific.
There are certainly those who think a coronation would save time and political energy and allow Labour to concentrate on the 2016 Holyrood election campaign.
Others argue that a contest would allow a fuller debate about Labour's problems and possible solutions and give the new leader more authority to pursue reform.
Mr Macintosh said he would campaign on fairness and social justice across the whole of Scotland with an emphasis on lifelong learning, housing and renewable energy.
"The reason I think it is important that I put my views forward is I think that is all about restoring trust in the Labour Party," he said.
"At the last election people could not bring themselves to put their trust in Labour. I can't believe that after all these years and what we stand for."
Mr Macintosh said restoring the Scottish Labour Party required integrity, principles and honesty and "moving away from machine politics and guile and the idea it's about power and position".
"I'm in politics to make other people's lives better, whether I'm leader or not leader, whether I'm MSP or not MSP. I am a conviction politician," he said.
He said problems with the "party machine" were about "people who want power and position and influence", which was an "issue for all politicians".
"We have to remember our principles and if we can't do that we can't restore confidence in the Labour Party," Mr Macintosh added.
Former East Renfrewshire MP Mr Murphy announced that he would resign next month after Labour's crushing general election defeat at the hands of the SNP.
Ms Dugdale, the Lothian region MSP, said she welcomed a leadership contest.
She has won the backing of more than half of Scottish Labour's MSPs and MP Ian Murray since announcing her intention to stand on Friday.
"I am proud to have already won the support of so many Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament," Ms Dugdale said.
"The geographical spread of support I have - with MSPs from north and south, east and west - as well as the backing of MSPs from different parts of our movement shows I can bring our party together."

They had first voted for industrial action in December 2015 and about 4,000 lecturers went on strike in March.
Lecturers said pay varied by up to Â£10,000 a year at different colleges.
EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "Members in colleges across Scotland have given their overwhelming approval of the pay offer.
"This pay agreement shows what can be achieved by a group of employees standing together, through their union, to protect their rights."
John Kelly, President of EIS-FELA said: "While this very clear ballot result settles this particular issue over pay, specifically the top of the salary scale for unpromoted lecturers across Scotland, there is still much work to do to agree the detail of all national pay scales.
"We are hopeful that constructive negotiations can move the process forward, so that further industrial action is not necessary in the future."

Driver Carl Longfield said he left work on Wednesday with no idea the company was going to cease operating.
"I left the depot thinking everything was OK saying, 'see you tomorrow' and I got home and got a text at about 19:55 saying 'thank you very much but we are ceasing trading at 00:01'.
"We had no idea the company was in such a bad state," he said.
"The more concern for me is the passengers we have left behind in the remote communities. They relied on our services to get into work, to school, to colleges and they've been left remote."
Richard Green, another driver, said he felt completely "deflated" by the news and said he was also concerned for passengers.
"They relied on us but evidently the company couldn't be bothered about them."
The drivers met the company's liquidator earlier.
They said they were told employees would receive two weeks' pay if they had been with the company for two years or more.

Article text: despite the UK government reviewing the plans and not yet giving final approval for the nuclear plant.
The French firm said it was "highly positive" the plant would be built.
Those opposed to the nuclear build said EDF was attempting to "twist" the arm of the government.
More on the Hinkley contracts and other news from the West
Earlier this month EDF agreed to invest in the first new UK nuclear plant in 20 years, and was poised to exchange contracts with the government.
But hours after the decision was announced by the French energy firm, the government said it would review the plans and make its decision in the autumn.
Roy Pumfrey, of the campaign group Stop Hinkley, said: "They're trying to bounce the British government into not having a pause, but perhaps even having the Prime Minister returning from holiday in Switzerland to say, 'All right, we'll give in, we'll go ahead with it'.
"I cannot believe the British government is going to have its arm twisted by them. "Whilst [the supply chain contracts] will be locally beneficial, they are relatively small beer to the £18bn value of the project."
Commercial director for Hinkley Point C, Ken Owen, said: "I'm highly positive that Hinkley will be built and my job on the project is to get the supply chain equipped and ready to go."
He said the contracts were for a mixture of services, and 660 jobs would be created locally.
Mr Owen said: "We're not just building a power station, we're servicing a mini-city. We've got 5,500 people per shift, per day. We have to look after the catering, the welfare.
"We're building the largest hotel in the UK - 1,500 beds per night - and the management of that is being done by local businesses."

"We want to him to have a go. We want to have a go," Dalman said.
"We had very extensive discussions over what his needs are.
"We've agreed on all of them and I think he needs to get off the block pretty quickly in getting his team together for next season.
"We always want promotion - every season we say that.
"The real wonderful situation for us here, and I don't think people appreciate, is that Neil has his own agenda on getting promotion.
"That plays into our hands very well. We have somebody who has ambitions beyond being a manager and that's fantastic news for us.
Cardiff were in the Championship relegation zone when Warnock took over, but have moved up to 12th after three successive wins.
The former Leeds, QPR and Crystal Palace boss had been seeking assurances over the club's transfer policy before committing to a new deal.
Dalman said the club's Malaysian-based owner Tan did not need any convincing about retaining Warnock for for the 2017-18 season.
"He watches every game, he doesn't need any convincing," Dalman told BBC Wales Sport.
"We all make decisions on a rational basis. You look at the results, you look at the atmosphere, look at the togetherness and you look at the attendances.
"Neil addressed all those things all in one go so Vincent would never have doubts about supporting someone like Neil.
"Because he's incentivised by his own motives all we have to do is give him the platform and the environment to achieve that."
Dalman said Warnock has brought "togetherness" to the Championship club since replacing Paul Trollope in October 2016.
"We love Neil to bits, both on a personal and professional basis. He's good for us and long may it last," Dalman said.
"He's won the management over, certainly the owner and the board. He communicates extremely well with the fans and most importantly with the players.
"Getting Neil on board there was no hesitation and renewing his contract was the same."

Article text: candidate said Mr Goldsmith's backing for Brexit would be "uppermost in voters' minds".
Sarah Olney, who has already been selected to fight the seat at the next General Election, said it was a "farce" the by-election was taking place, saying it was the result of Tory in-fighting but added that the Lib Dems were looking forward to "putting our message in front of voters".
Ms Olney, who like Mr Goldsmith is opposed to Heathrow expansion, told the BBC's Daily Politics: "We are on the same side as far as Heathrow is concerned, so for the voters to be able to choose between us, it's going to be fought on other issues - and I think Brexit is currently going to be the main issue that's uppermost in voters' minds."
A local breakdown of the EU referendum results shows almost 70% of voters in the Richmond council area, which makes up the bulk of the constituency, backed Remain.
Ms Olney is expected to be confirmed as the party's pick for the by-election after party leader Tim Farron rejected the idea of parachuting in one of its big names.
The Conservatives are not fielding a candidate against Mr Goldsmith, who held the south-west London seat in 2015 with a 23,015 majority. The Lib Dems, who held the seat until 2010, finished second.
Labour says it will field a candidate despite three of its MPs urging it to consider standing aside to maximise the chances of a Tory defeat.
The Green Party said it was also likely to put forward a candidate although it said it supported "progressives working together to beat the Conservatives".
In standing down, Mr Goldsmith - who has long campaigned against a third runway -  fulfilled a pledge to quit if the government backed the expansion.
He said: "There was no small print, no expiry date, no ambiguity. It was a simple promise. And it mattered.
"I know it mattered, because the thought of Heathrow expansion fills most of my constituents with dread."

Article text: on better and better algorithms, my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child is given through experiences in both quantity and quality."
Back in 2007, Ms Li and a colleague set about the mammoth task of sorting and labelling a billion diverse and random images from the internet to offer examples of the real world for the computer - the theory being that if the machine saw enough pictures of something, a cat for example, it would be able to recognise it in real life.
They used crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, calling on 50,000 workers from 167 countries to help label millions of random images of cats, planes and people.
Eventually they built ImageNet - a database of 15 million images across 22,000 classes of objects organised by everyday English words.
It has become an invaluable resource used across the world by research scientists attempting to give computers vision.
Each year Stanford runs a competition, inviting the likes of Google, Microsoft and Chinese tech giant Baidu to test how well their systems can perform using ImageNet. In the last few years they have got remarkably good at recognising images - with around a 5% error rate.
To teach the computer to recognise images, Ms Li and her team used neural networks, computer programs assembled from artificial brain cells that learn and behave in a remarkably similar way to human brains.
A neural network dedicated to interpreting pictures has anything from a few dozen to hundreds, thousands, or even millions of artificial neurons arranged in a series of layers.
Each layer will recognise different elements of the picture - one will learn that there are pixels in the picture, another layer will recognise differences in the colours, a third layer will determine its shape and so on.
By the time it gets to the top layer - and today's neural networks can contain up to 30 layers - it can make a pretty good guess at identifying the image.
At Stanford, the image-reading machine now writes pretty accurate captions (see examples above) for a whole range of images although it does still get things wrong - so for instance a picture of a baby holding a toothbrush was wrongly labelled "a young boy is holding a baseball bat".
Despite a decade of hard work, it still only has the visual intelligence level of a three-year-old, said Prof Li.
And, unlike a toddler, it doesn't yet understand context.
"So far, we have taught the computer to see objects or even tell us a simple story when seeing a picture," Prof Li said.
But when she asks it to assess a picture of her own son at a family celebration the machine labels it simply: "Boy standing next to a cake".
She added: "What the computer doesn't see is that this is a special Italian cake that's only served during Easter time."
That is the next step for the laboratory - to get machines to understand whole scenes, human behaviours and the relationships between objects.
The ultimate aim is to create "seeing" robots that can assist in surgical operations, search out and rescue people in disaster zones and generally improve our lives for the better, said Ms Li.
The work into visual learning at Stanford illustrates how complex just one aspect of creating a thinking machine can be and it comes on the back of 60 years of fitful progress in the field.
Back in 1950,  pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing wrote a paper speculating about a thinking machine and the term "artificial intelligence" was coined in 1956 by Prof John McCarthy at a gathering of scientists in New Hampshire known as the Dartmouth Conference.
After some heady days and big developments in the 1950s and 60s, during which both the Stanford lab and one at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were set up, it became clear that the task of creating a thinking machine was going to be a lot harder than originally thought.
There followed what was dubbed the AI winter - a period of academic dead-ends when funding for AI research dried up.
But, by the 1990s, the focus in the AI community shifted from a logic-based approach - which basically involved writing a whole lot of rules for computers to follow - to a statistical one, using huge datasets and asking computers to mine them to solve problems for themselves.
In the 2000s, faster processing power and the ready availability of vast amounts of data created a turning point for AI and the technology underpins many of the services we use today.
It allows Amazon to recommend books, Netflix to suggest movies and Google to offer up relevant search results. Smart little algorithms began trading on Wall Street - sometimes going further than they should, as in the 2010 Flash Crash when a rogue algorithm was blamed for wiping billions off the New York stock exchange.
It also provided the foundations for the voice assistants, such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, on smartphones.
At the moment such machines are learning rather than thinking and whether a machine can ever be programmed to think is debatable given that the nature of human thought has eluded philosophers and scientists for centuries.
And there will remain elements to the human mind - daydreaming for example - that machines will never replicate.
But increasingly they are evaluating their knowledge and improving it and most people would agree that AI is entering a new golden age where the machine brain is only going to get smarter.ã€€

Article text: The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) wants to replace the lifeboat building on South Marine Drive in Bridlington with a new one 500m away on Spa Promenade.
The RNLI said the 1903 building was "cramped and outdated".
East Riding of Yorkshire Council will decide whether to pass the plans on 8 January.
The council had previously agreed the promenade south of Bridlington Spa could be widened by up to seven metres so the current lifeboat can be launched more safely and effectively.
Michael Oakes, of the RNLI, said the new site, which is between Bridlington Spa and the pumping station, would mean all the lifesaving equipment could be kept together in one place instead of the inshore lifeboat and equipment being kept a short walk away in a separate building on Princess Mary Promenade.
Mr Oakes said it would also mean quicker launch times because the lifeboat would not need to cross the road and the Shannon-class lifeboat, which is due to replace the current Mersey all-weather lifeboat by 2018, could be kept inside coupled with its launch vehicle.
Plans for the two-storey building include public viewing areas, a mechanic station and a shop, as well as improved changing and equipment facilities.
The RNLI has other lifeboat stations at Flamborough, Bridlington, Withernsea and Humber in East Yorkshire.
