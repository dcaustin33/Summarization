Article text: In the three months to August, output fell by 0.8%, the biggest such decline since March 2013.
Meanwhile, the UK trade deficit was £3.3bn in August, a narrowing of £1.2bn from July, it said.
But the deficit was larger than expected and is set to weigh on growth, the ONS added.
An ONS official said the weak figures for construction in August may have been linked to wet weather during the month.
Housebuilding fell by 3% from July and output in other parts of the sector also contracted for the first across-the-board decline since 2010.
The trade figures showed the UK's deficit in its trade in goods narrowed to £11.1bn in August compared with £12.2bn in July, although some analysts had expected it to shrink further.
The deficit of £11.1bn on goods was partly offset by a £7.9bn surplus on services. Exports increased by £0.8bn, boosted by cars.
The combined goods deficit for July and August is already twice that of the previous quarter, and is likely to have a negative effect on overall GDP growth.
The UK's economy grew by 0.7% in the second quarter of the year, but Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said overall growth prospects for the third quarter had received a "double blow" from the construction and trade data, which was "seriously bad news overall".
"Overall, the data reinforce our belief that GDP growth is likely be no better than 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, and there is now a significant risk that it could have been weaker still."
David Kern, chief economist of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: "The large trade deficit remains a major national problem. Greater efforts are needed to support our exporters and to secure a long-term improvement in our trading position."

Brendan Rodgers' side needed three points against fifth-placed Hearts to be confirmed as champions after Aberdeen hammered Dundee on Friday.
And they did so with a hat-trick from Scott Sinclair and goals from Stuart Armstrong and Patrick Roberts.
Unbeaten Celtic have dropped just four points so far during their campaign.
"My job when I came in was to win it in the best way we possibly could," said Rodgers.
"We have had many outstanding performances, but we have only just begun because there's still an awful lot of development in this team. That's the real exciting part."

Celtic are still on course to win the domestic treble, having beaten Aberdeen in November to win the League Cup, while they face rivals Rangers in the Scottish Cup semi-finals later this month.
The last time the club won all three major Scottish domestic trophies in one season was 2000-01 and the feat has only been achieved once since - when Rangers claimed a treble in 2002-03.
"The run we're on is incredible," said Rodgers in an interview with Football Focus prior to Sunday's title-clinching victory.
"In terms of the treble, we never really mention it. Obviously the supporters can dream, which is great, but we have to just think about performing and playing well."
Celtic could also became the first team to go a full 38-game Scottish Premiership campaign unbeaten.
The last time a Scottish side went a full season unbeaten was Rangers in 1898-99, while Celtic did the same the year before - but the season only lasted 18 games.

Former Liverpool boss Rodgers was appointed in May 2016 to replace Ronny Deila, who quit at the end of last season after two mixed years in charge.
Deila led Celtic to back-to-back titles but failed to deliver success in Europe, losing to Maribor and Malmo in the last round of Champions League qualifying and also finishing last in their Europa League group in 2015-16.
Rodgers' first major task was to qualify for the Champions League group stages, only for Celtic to suffer arguably the worst defeat in their history against Gibraltarian part-time side Lincoln Red Imps in the second qualifying round first leg.
After winning the second leg to progress, they needed a stoppage-time penalty from Moussa Dembele to edge past Kazakh side Astana in the third qualifying round before hanging on away to Hapoel Beer Sheva of Israel to reach the group stages.
Once there, they suffered their heaviest European defeat in a 7-0 thrashing by Barcelona but recovered to secure two draws against Premier League side Manchester City and a draw at German side Borussia Monchengladbach.
"We need a couple of players in order to compete at Champions League level - we had some really good performances but there is certain dynamic, power and technique we need," Rodgers told Sky Sports after Sunday's title win.

A summer clearout led to forwards Carlton Cole, Anthony Stokes, Colin Kazim-Richards and Stefan Scepovic all departing Celtic Park.
Yet the club were not left short of attacking talent after the signings of Dembele from Fulham and Scott Sinclair from Aston Villa.
Dembele, 20, has scored 32 goals this season and is now one of Europe's most sought-after talents, while 28-year-old winger Sinclair has struck 21 times in all competitions.
Rodgers has also improved the fortunes of players he inherited, most notably 25-year-old central midfielder Stuart Armstrong, who has impressed since becoming a regular starter after October, making his Scotland debut in March.
Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton: "People can knock the Scottish league as much as they like, but at the start of the season, Rangers thought they could push Celtic.
"Brendan has done nothing wrong - unbeaten in the league, relative success in Europe given that the last manager was really poor and they had no right to get in the Champions League. I didn't think they'd get in the Europa League.
"He has worked wonders this season and should get credit for that.
"The pressure for Rodgers was going to come in the early part of the season, because the Celtic fans expected this season and expectation was high.
"He's totally transformed the playing personnel, made good signings and the team is a million times better."
Former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner: "Celtic will buy one or two more players and they can attract quality since they are in the Champions League.
"They did it in style. Their finishing was magnificent against Hearts - once they settled into this game, there was no chance of Hearts winning it.
"The way Celtic have gone about their business from day one has been exceptional. It's been a joy to watch them this season."
Rodgers has been suggested as a possible replacement for Arsene Wenger should the Arsenal boss decide to leave at the end of the season.
The Northern Irishman himself has said he wants to "give more years" to Celtic and is a supporter of what he calls "one of the most iconic clubs in the world".
But could Rodgers make a return to the Premier League?
Former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann: "Brendan Rodgers has got more chance and justification to get a big job now then he did at the time when he went to Liverpool.
"To go a whole season unbeaten, which they can still do, to get in the Champions League against all the odds and give Manchester City a game - of course they had a heavy defeat to Barcelona but it's happened to others.
"If you look at that Arsenal job, Rodgers could be one of the first names on the list."
Sunday Times football correspondent Jonathan Northcroft: "Rodgers is still in the rebuilding phase of his career.
"I'm a fan of his in general, but this will be his first league title and he only just won his first trophy in November, so he's quite a long way away from being the man to succeed Arsene Wenger.
"He got quite sensitive towards the end of his time with Liverpool, towards how things were covered - he was banning the press.
"If he wants another big job, he's going to have to handle that properly."

Article text: Wildschut crossed for defender Reece Burke to put the visitors ahead from close range against the run of play.
Aaron Mooy equalised straight after half-time for the Terriers.
But Wildschut ran from inside his own half to round goalkeeper Danny Ward and slot home the winner.
The two teams came into the match at opposite ends of the table but both in poor form, with Huddersfield's early season dominance having fallen away in recent weeks.
However, the Terriers dominated the first half without finding the breakthrough, although Elias Kachunga did have an effort ruled out for offside.
Wigan had already looked dangerous on the break when they counter-attacked again and Wildschut sped down the right before delivering a centre for unmarked on-loan West Ham defender Burke to fire home.
Whatever Town boss David Wagner said at half-time clearly worked as five minutes into the second half, Mooy equalised after Nahki Wells' left-wing centre found him at the far post.
But Huddersfield had not learned their lesson when the Latics broke again and Wildschut ran unchallenged from the halfway line to round Ward and slot the ball home.
Wigan's first win in three games moves them up a place and although they are still in the relegation zone, it puts them level with Wolves on 18 points.
The Terriers are clinging on to the final play-off place but have now conceded 15 goals in their last six games, having only let in 10 in their opening 12 matches.
Huddersfield boss David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We played some good stuff today, we brought our identity on the grass, created moments and played with speed and were energetic. It was a good game from my side, but unfortunately we didn't get two penalties in my opinion, after speaking with the guys from the TV one was 100%.
"Our biggest problem in our game was that we were not able to handle their counter-attacks better than we did.
"The first one we have to clear in the middle of the pitch, not when their winger was on the sideline, and the second one we switched off after we thought we had cleared the situation and the ball goes over our head.
"We have to give credit to our opponent. It was a gameplan Wigan had and it worked for them. They did exactly the same against Barnsley and we were not able to defend it better today."
Wigan boss Warren Joyce told BBC Radio Manchester:
"I'm obviously pleased to get the three points but it's just one game and you have to follow it up by bringing some consistency into the group, so we're seeing that regularly not only on a weekly basis but on a daily basis that we do the right things every day and then if you're doing that, there's a pretty good chance you are going to do it consistently on a Saturday or a Monday night.
"Yanic Wildschut is a very effective footballer. If he's got the ball at his feet or he's dribbling with it or he's running down the sides he's almost unstoppable at times. I just think he's a forward player that can play wide and I quite like him in that position so at the minute that's where you're looking to play him.
"Marcus Rashford played on the wing all the way through and it was a deliberate plan. I see similar similarities with Yanic's attributes, he's still a young player and he's got an unbelievable amount of pace and an unbelievable talent and if he wants to work hard and try and improve every day you don't know what the future could hold for him.
"One win doesn't really change anything about the situation we're in. We've got some really tough games coming up - tonight was a tough game where we've managed to get the three points."

Article text: According to a pair of scientific studies, key genes in the immune system come from our ancient "cousins".
The findings, which appear in The American Journal of Human Genetics, suggest we have Neanderthals to thank for being able to fight off pathogens.
But interbreeding may have had a downside, as the same genes may have made us more prone to allergies.
Modern-day people can trace their ancestry to a small population that emerged from Africa about 60,000 years ago.
As the African humans spread out across the world, they came into contact with other ancient humans based in Europe and Western Asia.
Genetic evidence suggests that these different "tribes" interbred, with part of the genome of Neanderthals still present in humans alive today.
About 1% to 6% of the modern Eurasian human genome seems to come from Neanderthals and Denisovans - another extinct member of the human family.
Scientists in Germany analysed the genes of both modern humans and our ancient relatives to find the source of changes in our immune system's genetic blueprints.
They found some of the fragments of Neanderthal DNA in humans alive today play a key role in the immune system as the front line of defence against pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and parasites.
"The evidence suggests that this genetic region contributes to the immune system of modern day humans," Dr Michael Dannemann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, told BBC News.
"At some point in history it might have been an advantage to have these Neanderthal genes in terms of fighting off infections or lethal pathogens from 10,000 years ago.
"It could also still be an advantage today but this is difficult to pinpoint."
Dr Danneman, a co-researcher on one of the papers, said this inheritance from the Neanderthals could also have left some people more prone to allergies - because of the effect on the immune system - although this needs further investigation in the laboratory.
A second group of researchers - in France and the US - independently analysed genetic data on modern people from the 1000 Genomes project together with the genome sequences of ancient humans.
They came to similar conclusions - that a particular cluster of important human immune genes come from Neanderthals and Denisovans.
Dr Lluis Quintana-Murci of the Unit of Human Evolutionary Genetics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, said the findings came as a big surprise.
"Our big surprise was to find that this gene region has such a high Neanderthal ancestry because this region has been shown to have a major biological relevance in host survival against pathogens," he said.
"Maybe we should thank Neanderthals for having given us diversity in innate immunity to survive better against pathogens."

Article text: Boston beat domestic competition from Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington DC to be put forward.
"Our goal is to host Olympic and Paralympic Games that are innovative, walkable and hospitable to all," said Boston mayor Marty Walsh.
The deadline for cities to apply to host the Games is 15 September.
The International Olympic Committee are due to make a decision in 2017.
The last time the USA hosted a summer games was in Atlanta in 1996, although Salt Lake City, Utah, hosted the Winter Olympics in 2002.
"I very much want to bring the games to the United States to share the incredible spirit of the games with another generation of Americans, and advance the Olympic and Paralympic movements," said American IOC executive board member Anita DeFrantz.
The US is the third country after Germany and Italy to officially launch a bidding process.
At an IOC meeting in Monaco in December, a 40-point action plan was voted on to revamp the sporting showpiece.
Potential hosts will find it easier and cheaper to bid under the "Olympic Agenda 2020" reforms and events can be held outside the host country or city.
The 28-sport cap for future summer Olympics has been removed - although there will be no changes to the Rio 2016 schedule.
Instead of a 28-sport limit, each summer Games will be restricted to 10,500 athletes and 310 events.

The area's mayor said at least 66 people were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties.
Officials said the fire had been controlled but that there is still smoke in the area.
The cargo terminal and nearby homes were evacuated and residents were asked to stay inside.
The container terminal was operated by Localfrio, a logistics company, in Guaruja, an area on the eastern side of Santos, in Sao Paulo state.
A spokeswoman for the company, which exports chemicals used for refrigeration and general cargo, said the containers were filled with chloric acid and sodium dichloroisocyanurate - a cleaning and disinfectant agent.
Firefighters said rainwater had seeped into the containers causing a chemical reaction.
Local Mayor Mario Antonieta de Brito asked people to stay out of the rain which could "contain chemical elements that can burn the skin".

Article text: Speaking in Cardiff, Mr Osborne said this year is likely to be one of the toughest since the financial crisis.
He told business leaders that far from "mission accomplished" on the economy, "2016 is the year of mission critical".
His message is in stark contrast to the positive tone of his Autumn Statement, when he said the UK was "growing fast".
Earlier the chancellor  told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Autumn Statement had put in place a four-year plan to restore the UK's public finances, and make the economy more productive, with businesses more competitive so they could create jobs.
"It is precisely because we live in an uncertain world. It is precisely because we have not abolished boom and bust as a nation, that you need to take these steps, difficult steps, and I need to go explaining to the public, that the difficult times aren't over, we have got to go on making the difficult decisions, precisely so that Britain can continue to enjoy the low unemployment and the rising wages that we see at the moment," Mr Osborne said.
The chancellor's warning came on the same day that China suspended trading on its stock markets after only 15 minutes.
Circuit-breakers triggered the Chinese share suspension following a 7% fall in the country's main index.
Later on Thursday, the Chinese authorities said they were suspending the circuit-breaker system.
The price of a range of key commodities, such as oil, gas and iron ore, has fallen sharply in the past year, a move that indicates weakening demand in the global economy while oil prices hit fresh 11-year lows. earlier on Monday.
But shadow chancellor John McDonnell blamed the government's "failed economic policies" for the threats facing the economy.
"It's a cocktail of his own mixture - failing to invest, failing to rebalance the economy, relying upon consumer debt to boost the economy for an election victory and now we're facing our own lethal cocktail within our own economy," he told the BBC.
"He's getting his excuses in early for the problems that he's caused that will now unfortunately hit upon many families across the country, especially if interest rates are increased during the year."
The chancellor laid out a number of risks that the UK economy faces over the next 12 months in his Cardiff speech.
People must not be "complacent" that the economy is fixed, he said.
Significant challenges - including tension in the Middle East, slowing growth in China and low commodity prices - are all weighing on global confidence, he added.
Mr Osborne told the Today programme the UK's economic recovery was not "a debt-fuelled recovery", citing the support of the governor of the Bank of England in his assessment.
But the chancellor said he feared there was a complacency that appeared to be developing in the UK's national debate.
"You have had people coming on programmes like this saying, 'We've got to spend billions of pounds here or billions of pounds there; the country can afford it,'" Mr Osborne said.
"All the old habits, all the old habits, all the old bad ways that got Britain into that mess are re-emerging in some of our national debate and I need to remind people that it's a very challenging world out there, that Britain still has big economic problems that it has to fix," he said.
"I am determined to see through the plan that has got the British economy that is in the stronger position that it is in today," he added.
On the domestic front, the first interest rate rise since 2007 could come this year.
Treasury sources pointed out that is not a decision for the chancellor - interest rate rises are a matter for the Bank of England - but there are many homeowners with large mortgages who have never experienced even a small rate rise.
Privately, those close to Mr Osborne have expressed concerns that a rate rise could have an impact on consumer confidence.
But Mr Osborne denied he was putting any pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates, adding, "People like Mark Carney would not respond to that pressure."
He added that rising interest rates should be seen as a sign of a strong economy.
"We have to make sure we are ready for whatever the interest rate environment is," Mr Osborne said.
But, he added, if and when interest rates rose, it would be a sign of a stronger economy that was normalising after the financial crisis.

Article text: The Houthi delegation, which was due to arrive on Sunday, was still in Djibouti in east Africa on Monday evening.
Mr Ban warned that "while the parties bicker, Yemen burns" and urged an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
An estimated 20 million Yemenis are in need of aid following months of fighting in the country.
The humanitarian situation has been described as "catastrophic" by the UN, with more than 2,000 people killed in the conflict.
Opening the talks, Mr Ban said: "Today Yemen's very existence hangs in the balance."
He urged action on three main areas: "First, a renewed humanitarian pause to allow critical assistance to reach all Yemenis in need and provide a respite for Yemenis as the holy month of Ramadan begins.
"Second, I urge the parties to reach agreement on local ceasefires. Third, I call on them to resume a peaceful and orderly political transition and to ensure that the process includes more representation from other political parties, women, youth and civil society."
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva said the Houthi representatives were apparently delayed over what airspace their plane could fly through. She said that the confusion did not bode well for the talks.
A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states has been bombing the Houthi rebels and their allies since March.
The bombing campaign was launched to support Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who escaped to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, when the Houthis advanced on his stronghold in Aden in southern Yemen.
In recent weeks, fighting between Saudi forces and the Houthis has intensified on Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia.
On Saturday, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a Scud missile fired by the Houthis.
The attack followed fighting on the border on Friday, in which four Saudi soldiers and a number of Yemeni rebels died.
On the same day, bombs hit the Old City of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing five people according to local sources.

Article text: His 14th-minute volley, in the last game of his emergency loan from Celtic, was enough to see off a determined Dumbarton side.
The hosts created several openings and will wonder how Christian Nade failed to score from close range.
It was not vintage from Hibs, but a potentially important win in the title race as Dundee United could only draw.
Technique alone was not enough to separate Hibs from the home side - and both Martin Boyle and Chris Humphrey found early runs affected by a bobbly surface and Marvin Bartley had to hack a Gary Fleming shot clear from inside the area.
The visitors had to be resourceful and their shrewdest, most assured figure inevitably delivered a telling moment. When Humphrey's cross was headed away inside the area, the ball dropped to Commons and he carefully steered the ball into the bottom corner.
The goal ought to have empowered Hibs, but they were unable to take command of the game.
The home side, instead, proved persistent and Lewis Vaughan briefly rose to prominence.
First, he created a chance for Robert Thomson with good skill, only for Hibs captain David Gray to make a goal-saving tackle, and then drew a good save from Ross Laidlaw with a powerful shot from 25 yards.
Hibs were more assertive after the break, with Boyle making several forays down the left with his quick and direct running. Lewis Stevenson also saw a strike bundled away by Dumbarton goalkeeper Alan Martin, with Humphrey then shooting wide
The home side remained ambitious, though, and some neat skill from Vaughan saw him skip past two Hibs defenders only for Laidlaw to rush out and smother the ball at his feet. Gray then had to head another effort off the line.
On a rare foray upfield by Hibs, an attack ended with Dumbarton defender David Smith clearing off the line. Moments later, Nade should have equalised at the back post, but failed to connect.
Dumbarton manager Steve Aitken: "My team were magnificent. They were up against a strong side, a big club and Neil will get them over the line, but we matched them and for spells were better. On another day, we would have taken more.
"We had chances, Christian's probably came too quickly at him.
"If they can keep giving me that [level of performance], we'll be fine."
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "It was very tough. Dumbarton are on the up, Stevie's going a great job, [and it was] difficult conditions.
"It's a fantastic win and in the end we missed some good chances to put a more flattering scoreline on it.
"Dumbarton put us under pressure for periods of the game and we had to see it out. In the end, we just about deserved to tip over the line."

Article text: She will address 120 chief executives at Irish business organisation Ibec and is expected to emphasise that "Scotland is open for business".
Ms Sturgeon will also visit the Scottish government's investment and innovation hub in the city.
She said she wanted to strengthen Scotland's Irish links "even further".
"Scottish exports to Ireland are worth Â£1.125bn and Irish investment into Scotland currently supports more than 6,000 jobs," she said.
"It's important to get across to our European partners, such as Ireland, that Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and that we are doing everything we can to protect our relationship with Europe.
"I want companies in Ireland to know that Scotland remains open for business and will continue to be an attractive place to invest.
"I will be asking the delegates at Ibec to work with the hub and to come to Scotland to see what we have to offer.
"A number of new Scottish investment wins have been landed this year and through the strong network the hub continues to develop with Irish-based investors - further projects are in the pipeline."
Ms Sturgeon said "Ireland has always been and will continue to be a key economic partner for Scotland".
"It is even more important than ever that our two countries work together for the benefit of both our nations," she said.
On Friday, Ms Sturgeon told a summit of the British-Irish Council that remaining in the single market was the UK's "least worst" Brexit option.
She said staying inside the common market after leaving the EU would be best for every part of the UK.

Article text: Fatbergs are caused when cooking fat, oil and grease are poured down drains and become tangled up with waste items like baby wipes and sanitary products.
The blockage is in a sewer beneath the Dublin Road in Belfast.
Northern Ireland Water said crews have already removed "a couple of hundred tonnes" of grease from the sewer.
The firm said cooking fat is a "significant" problem in the area as it houses several fast food outlets.
The company's networks sewerage manager, Gavin McCready, warned restaurant owners that fatbergs could have some very unpleasant side-effects.
"These fat blockages can not only result in out-of-sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises."
Mr McCready also said it was adding unnecessary costs to the businesses and the public purse.
"While most businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don't are contributing to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area.
"Our team has been on the site, working over a number of Sunday mornings, clearing the fat that has solidified.
"This is labour intensive work that can only be done early in the morning before the traffic builds up."
In the last two years NI Water has spent over Â£5m clearing blockages from the sewer system.
The company said up to 80% of blockages were caused by fat, oil and grease and other inappropriate items being flushed into drains.
The items get stuck together and form a ball, which can build up over time to block sewer pipes.
Earlier this month, NI Water spent five hours clearing a fatberg from a drain in Newry, County Down.
The blockage was at Buttercrane Quay in the city centre.
In August 2013, Britain's biggest ever fatberg was removed from a London sewer.
Thames Water said the lump found under a street in Kingston upon Thames was the size of a bus.
----------------------------------------
Ground truth Summary: An operation to remove a "massive fatberg" from a Belfast sewer has been ongoing for the last six Sundays and is expected to take several more.

Article text: Finance Minister Jane Hutt told AMs the 2016/17 draft budget backed Labour's "priorities for Wales and its future".
Total health spending rises by 4.1% while education and skills goes up by 1.1%, but local government faces a cut of 2%.
The Conservatives said the spending plans offered "too little, far too late for our hardworking NHS staff".
Ms Hutt said the Welsh government had faced a 3.6% cut in UK government funding over five years, once the effects of inflation were taken into account.
About £260m will go on day-to-day, or revenue, funding for the NHS and another £33m will be spent on infrastructure, maintaining the NHS estate and equipment.
There will, however, be a reduction of £15m from other parts of the health budget, giving a net figure for the NHS of £278m.
Although the education and skills funding is getting an increase, the body which funds Welsh universities said its budget was being cut by £41m, nearly a third of the total.
The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales had already warned not enough money was available to Welsh universities, because of the way tuition fees are funded.
Boosts to the Communities, Economy and Natural Resources budgets are largely made up of capital spending increases, for example housing and flood defence projects.
Their day-to-day, or revenue, budgets, are being cut.
Ms Hutt said her aim was to protect the services that mattered most to people, within the financial constraints.
"It has been another challenging settlement which has been set against the backdrop of successive real terms cuts to our Budget over the last five years," she said.
"We have continued our record investment in health with more than a quarter of a billion pounds going to the Welsh NHS in 2016-17 - demonstrating our wider approach to the health and social care and the value of preventative spend."
The lion's share of the Welsh government's total expenditure of £15.9bn comes from the UK Treasury, apart from about £1bn raised in business rates.
Almost half of the budget is spent on health, which has seen above-inflation increases since October 2013, when the Welsh government reversed its controversial decision not to protect the NHS budget between 2011 and 2013.
Conservative Shadow Finance Minister Nick Ramsay said Labour's latest budget boost for health could not make up for previous cuts to NHS funding.
"Hospital downgrading, huge delays in waiting times, a failure to recruit staff; this chaos is a direct result of Labour's record-breaking NHS budget cuts," he said.
"By failing to protect the budget, our health service has been starved of £1bn since 2010/11."
However, Plaid Cymru AM Alun Ffred Jones "warmly welcomed" the extra NHS cash.
"I do very much hope that this will enable waiting lists to be substantially reduced, in light of the harsh criticism of the Royal College of Surgeons in their statement yesterday," he said.
Liberal Democrat Peter Black highlighted an extra £1,150 each school would receive for every pupil eligible for free school meals, as part of a two year deal his party had struck with Labour ministers in 2014.
But he sought assurances that extra NHS money would not be used simply to pay off health board deficits, rather than to invest in the service.

Article text: The database is reported to contain information on 100,000 US Department of Defense employees, among others.
Troy Hunt, who published news of the leak, said the information had "enormous" potential for scammers.
Business services firm Dun & Bradstreet confirmed to tech news site ZDNet that it owns the data.
Information on government departments and private sector employees is commonly collated by business services that sell the data to other companies, such as marketing firms.
In this case, the records - including names, job titles and contact details - were originally compiled by NetProspex, which was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 2015.
Organisations with employees mentioned in the data include the US Postal Service, telecoms giant AT&T and the retailer Walmart.
Mr Hunt pointed out that people might try to use the names and email addresses in the database to scam or retrieve sensitive information from recipients - a practice known as spear phishing.
"The value for very targeted spear phishing is enormous because you can carefully craft messages that refer to specific individuals of influence and their roles within the organisation," he wrote on his blog.
Dun & Bradstreet told ZDNet: "Based on our analysis, it was not accessed or exposed through a Dun & Bradstreet system."
The leak is the latest in a long string of personal data caches dumped online.
In January, personal information of health workers in the US Army was found online by another security professional.

Marshall is the third player to refuse to stand for the anthem since Colin Kaepernick did so last month in protest at what he sees as racial injustice.
"I feel like this was the right thing to do," said Marshall.
Broncos beat Carolina 21-20 in a re-run of February's Super Bowl 50.
At a pre-season game in August, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Kaepernick chose to remain seated while the national anthem was played.
He said he would not "stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour".
Kaepernick's team-mate Eric Reid joined him in not standing during the team's final pre-season game while Seattle Seahawks' cornerback Jeremy Lane stayed seated ahead of a game with Oakland.
Marshall, a college team-mate of Kaepernick at Nevada, told NFL.com: "The message is I'm against social injustice. I'm not against the military or police or America at all.
"I knew what territory it came with, and I decided to do it. I feel like this is the right platform. This is our only platform to really be heard."

The NFL has previously said players are "encouraged but not required" to stand during the anthem.
The Panthers took a 17-7 lead into the fourth quarter of the first Super Bowl rematch to start a season since 1970, but running back CJ Anderson scored two touchdowns as the Broncos edged ahead.
Graham Gano's field goal pulled the Panthers within a point, but he then missed his next attempt from 50 yards with four seconds left as Denver held on.

Article text: DeFranco's family said the musician died on Wednesday evening at a Florida hospital.
His wife, Joyce, said his health had been poor in recent years.
DeFranco, a member of the American Jazz Hall of Fame, performed at venues around the world for 75 years and also recorded many albums.
The musician conducted the Glenn Miller Orchestra for eight years from 1966 to 1974.
He was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master and and later a Living Jazz Legend in a Kennedy Center ceremony.
And DeFranco won the Playboy All-Star award for top jazz clarinettist in the world 16 times.
"We have received condolences from around the world," DeFranco's wife told AP.
She said her husband's influence on music will last long beyond his lifetime.
Leading jazz clarinettist Ken Peplowski said: "Buddy DeFranco almost single-handedly was the clarinettist who moved the harmonic and rhythmic language forward from where Benny Goodman left off into the much more adventurous territory of bebop and beyond, while never forgetting his roots in swing music.
"He was also unfailingly kind and supportive to every other clarinettist who came after him."
Other top music stars he played with included Art Tatum, Ella Fitzgerald and Tony Bennett.
Originally named  Boniface Ferdinand Leonardo De Franco, the musician was born in Camden, New Jersey, but raised in south Philadelphia. He learned to play the mandolin at five, and took up the clarinet four years later.
He began his career as a teenager in Philadelphia and he went on to play with some of the major bands of his era including ones led by Tommy Dorsey, Count Basie, Gene Krupa and Charlie Barnett.
Later, composer Nelson Riddle was so impressed by DeFranco he wrote the musical Cross Country Suite in 1958 for him.
Legendary singer Nat King Cole, also introduced DeFranco when he premiered the work at the Hollywood Bowl.
Now, the annual Buddy DeFranco Jazz Festival is held each spring at the University of Montana.
DeFranco's family have asked that contributions in his memory be given to the festival so it can continue.
As well as his wife Joyce, the clarinettist is survived by his son Chad DeFranco.

Article text: Beatrice Lovane, 22, from Rochdale, fell ill before 21:30 BST on 26 August.
Returning a narrative verdict Heywood coroner Lisa Hashmi said she died of liver disease and damage caused by painkillers.
North West Ambulance Service admitted errors and is staging another inquiry.
Miss Lovane who was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, died in Fairfield General Hospital, Bury almost five hours after emergency services were called.
At Rochdale Coroner's Court, Ms Hashmi said "timely steps were not taken to instigate emergency treatment and basic life support" and there were "delays in indentifying the cause of her sudden collapse".
However, Ms Hashmi added it was "not possible to link the gross failure in care to the cause of death".
The North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) NHS Trust told the inquest, which concluded on Friday, it had identified a number of significant errors and omissions by the crew who attended.
After the verdict a NWAS spokesperson said in a statement it had received a complaint from Miss Lovane's family in March and a "full and thorough" investigation was undertaken.
The spokesperson added: "New evidence has recently been disclosed and as a result of this two paramedics and an emergency medical technician have been suspended from duty pending further investigation.
"We fully accept that the level of care Miss Lovane received was below the standard we would expect."
