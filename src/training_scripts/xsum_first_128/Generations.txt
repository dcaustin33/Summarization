Article text: The Cambridge University medical student, 29, left Blues for Racing 92 in 2013 and joined Quins this season.
He was preparing for the Varsity match when Quins posted a bonus-point win at Cardiff Arms Park in November.
"If you're playing against Jamie, you make your tackles," said Wilson.
Roberts was British and Irish Lions man of the series in their 2-1 Test defeat by South Africa in 2009.
The 6ft 4in, 17st 4lb centre also starred as the Lions beat Australia 2-1 in 2013 in a career that has seen him win 74 Wales caps.
"It'll be great for the players to shake hands and catch up with him before and after the game, but during the game it's business as usual."
Quins also recruited former Ospreys and Wales tight-head prop Adam Jones from Blues before the 2015-16 campaign.
Wilson added: "Our boys will be extremely motivated with a few links there, Adam Jones as well from last year."
Harlequins have four bonus-point wins and need only a point from the encounter at the Stoop to top the group.
They took the extra point in the last minute at the Arms Park, with a try from Danny Care thwarting Blues' hopes of a dramatic late win.
"It's obviously a huge challenge to go to Harlequins and get a win in front of their home crowd, but the boys want to put right the performance at home against a Harlequins side that deserved the win," said Wilson.
"Since then we've improved out performances with four wins out of five."
Blues had a weekend off before the match with the postponement of their fixture against Munster, while Harlequins inflicted a first Premiership defeat of the season on Saracens.
Wilson believes the the break will have benefited his side and they will travel "with confidence that we've played some good rugby to get the results we've had recently".
He added: "If we can perform to that level, we can cause Harlequins a headache."
Wales captain Sam Warburton, fellow flanker Ellis Jenkins and Wales full-back-fly-half Gareth Anscombe could all return from injury for Blues.

Article text: Police in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state, fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones and burning tyres in the streets, witnesses said.
Several protesters chanted slogans calling for the government's downfall.
Since June, Sudan has seen sporadic protests against government austerity measures, including fuel subsidy cuts.
The country's authorities have been trying to cut spending since Sudan lost three-quarters of its oil revenue when South Sudan seceded last year.
Demonstrators in Nyala chanted "No to high prices" and "People want to change the regime", according to witnesses.
Bothina Mohmed Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the state of South Darfur, said it was not known how the six deaths had happened, and that an investigation had been launched.
Opposition activists and media accused the police of using live ammunition.
The protests started on Monday when local students "rejected the price of transport announced by the government", Ms Ahmed said, adding that "other groups" had joined the protests and attacked government buildings.
"This has been happening on the main roads and in the main market area. There's been some damage to buildings," African Union-UN peacekeeping mission spokesman Christopher Cycmanick told AFP.
The anti-austerity protests in Sudan began in June among students in Khartoum, but have since spread to other social groups and areas.
They had recently dwindled as a result of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began on 20 July.
Until this year, Sudan had escaped the unrest characteristic of recent uprisings in Arab countries such as neighbouring Egypt, but correspondents say economic hardship caused by austerity has led to growing dissatisfaction with President Omar al-Bashir.

Swansea could name an unchanged starting line-up for a third successive game.
Captain Leon Britton has returned to training following a calf problem and will be part of the travelling squad.
Steve Wilson: "A few weeks ago, checking out Swansea's heaviest ever Premier League defeat was an essential task for whichever MOTD commentator was assigned to their next game.
"Under Bob Bradley they were lucky that record was only equalled when they lost 5-0 at Spurs - you suspect it could have been shattered had they played at Manchester City.
"But Paul Clement has already made such an impact that, incredibly, half of their Premier League wins this season have been accrued under his care - and he's only been in charge for four games.
"Getting something at City still looks a long shot, especially the way Pep Guardiola's men went about their oft-repeated task of ripping West Ham to shreds on Wednesday.
"But a Swansea thumping is not inevitable - and that's progress."
Twitter: @SteveWilson1967
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola on leaving out Sergio Aguero recently: "I understand the debate. But there is no doubt about the quality of Sergio."
"He's played all the games except one in Barcelona for a tactical decision and one when he'd come back from Argentina. The other games when he was not banned he always played - and played good.
"But now we knew from the beginning with have a new player [Gabriel Jesus].
"The big clubs in Europe always have a lot of strikers... you see at Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus - at Madrid [Alvaro] Morata doesn't play. Big clubs need a lot of strikers and we do."
Swansea City head coach Paul Clement: "We know there are 15 games to go with a hard game on Sunday.
"If we keep going as we are we have a big chance [of staying up] but there is a lot football to be played.
"There is a lot of hard work to do before we reach that point."
Swansea have seen an upturn in results since Paul Clement took charge but Manchester City have also improved dramatically of late.
A big part of that is the fact all of City's attacking players are in really good form and I don't think Swansea can keep them out.

Article text: The most extreme arctic blasts, blamed on a weather pattern known as the polar vortex, were said to have affected nearly 190 million people.
In Kentucky, an escaped prisoner turned himself in to get out of the cold.
Some parts of the Midwest hit -26C (-14F), as low as the Antarctic coast in winter, and much colder than the inside of a domestic freezer.
Temperature records were shattered in states across the US, including Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas, Michigan, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York.
It was -17C (1F) in the small town of Hell, Michigan, prompting online jokes that the weather was so bad even hell had frozen over.
But it was Embarrass, Minnesota, that experienced the lowest temperature in the nation on Tuesday: -37C (-35F).
That was colder than readings recently recorded on the Red Planet by the Mars Rover.
A video of a meteorologist tossing a pot of boiling water into the air in Wisconsin, to demonstrate how it immediately turns to snow, quickly went viral on the internet and was widely imitated.
A woman in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was taken to hospital with severe burns after she slipped on ice while attempting the trick, spilling boiling water on herself, the Argus Leader newspaper reported.
The extreme weather resulted in the usual travel chaos - nearly 2,700 US flights were cancelled on Tuesday.
More than 500 rail passengers on their way to Chicago were marooned overnight into Tuesday morning in northern Illinois on three Amtrak passenger trains after drifting snow and ice covered the tracks.
The big freeze was even testing the resolve of Canadians, no strangers to cold weather.
Temperatures in parts of Ontario fell to -30C (-22F), causing flights in and out of Pearson International Airport to be halted for several hours on Tuesday morning.
Roads in the cities of Toronto and Ottawa were coated in dangerous black ice.
Freezing temperatures were recorded even in usually mild southern states.
In northern Florida temperatures briefly dropped below freezing.
Atlanta, Georgia, was 25 degrees below average for this time of year.
"I didn't think the South got this cold," Marty Williams, a homeless man in the city, told the Associated Press news agency.
"That was the main reason for me to come down from up North, from the cold, to get away from all that stuff."
People in the Midwest are still digging out from two massive snow storms recently which dumped more than 2ft (61cm) of snow.
A reprieve is expected soon, however, with forecasters predicting temperatures above freezing for much of the US in the coming days.

Article text: Mr Bailey, 58, was arrested over the murder of French film producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier but never charged.
Ms Toscan Du Plantier was found beaten to death  near her remote holiday home in west Cork on 23 December 1996.
Mr Bailey told Dublin high court his life has been destroyed for the past 19 years because the police blamed him for a crime he did not commit.
However, on Monday, a jury found certain police officers had not conspired to obtain statements from a witness to implicate him in the murder.
Mr Bailey, who is originally from Manchester, had sued the Irish police (Garda) and the state for damages.
However, most of his claims were struck out in the closing stages of the case because the judge ruled they had not been made within the six year time limit required by law.
The case began on 4 November last year and heard from about 90 witnesses.

Article text: Nicola Sturgeon published an analysis of possible Brexit consequences, saying the Scottish economy could lose between £1.7bn and £11.2bn a year by 2030.
Ms Sturgeon said this could have a severe impact on public spending.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson urged the Scottish government to focus on stabilising the country in the wake of the Brexit vote.
She said it needed to focus on stability and "get back to the day job".
A spokesman for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Ms Davidson's comments as the "height of hypocrisy".
And he blamed the Conservatives for Brexit and the "huge economic damage" it could cause Scotland.
The UK as a whole voted to leave the European Union, but a majority (62%) of people living in Scotland voted to remain.
Ms Sturgeon said a second independence referendum was "highly likely" following the poll, but has promised to explore other options to safeguard Scotland's status in Europe.
Analysis published by the Scottish government suggested that by 2030, Scottish GDP was projected to be between £1.7bn and £11.2bn per year lower than it would have been if Brexit does not occur.
Tax revenue was projected to be between £1.7bn and £3.7bn lower.
Ms Sturgeon said "This paper shows, in the starkest possible terms, the potentially huge cost to Scotland of being taken out of the European Union and the single market.
"This analysis - based on a wide range of sources - demonstrates that leaving the EU, under any potential alternative arrangement, will have a profound and long-lasting impact on the public finances and the wider economic and societal wellbeing of both Scotland and the UK as a whole.
"That stark picture outlined today means that, whatever the model of relationship with the EU which is chosen by the UK government in their negotiations before and after Article 50 is triggered, it will not be as economically beneficial as full EU membership."
These figures are an arithmetical forecast, with caveats. They will be contested by those who argue that the UK/Scotland can thrive outside the EU. But they are also - indeed, primarily - a political tool.
Practical implications
Firstly, and most immediately, Nicola Sturgeon is seeking to some extent to pre-empt the publication on Wednesday of Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) figures.
Given that oil has continued to decline and that the economy generally is less than buoyant, the latest GERS verdict is unlikely to be rosy.
Secondly, and much more saliently, Ms Sturgeon is aiming an attack at the UK government and those who are currently pondering the practical implications of the Brexit vote.
She is saying that unless Brexit is accompanied by a soft landing, unless there is substantial mitigation, unless the terms can be made relatively favourable, the potential cost is huge. So today's paper is designed to contribute, sharply, to the Brexit preparation process.
However, there is a wider point. It is "simply unacceptable", Ms Sturgeon says, that "Scotland faces the prospect of being dragged out of the EU against its will".

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused Ms Sturgeon of using Brexit to deflect from the "underlying fragility" of Scotland's economy.
She said: "The first minister is in danger of losing the plot completely.
"Her own government's figures will show tomorrow that Scotland benefits from a multi-billion Union dividend.
"And yet, in order to revive her independence obsession, she is trying to pretend these facts don't exist."
Ms Davidson added: "Scotland benefits from being a member of the UK, and the UK benefits from our being there.
"It is time Nicola Sturgeon ended this charade, took her threat of a second independent referendum off the table, and got back to the day job of sorting out the mess her government has made of our public services."

Article text: Michael McFeat from Perthshire was expelled by the Kyrgyz authorities after comparing the national dish with the private parts of a horse.
Speaking to the Sunday Post newspaper, Mr McFeat described how he was helped to escape "a lynch mob".
He has now been banned from Kyrgyzstan for five years.
Mr McFeat told the newspaper he actually believed the traditional Kyrgyz dish - chuchuk sausage - was a horse's penis, but the remark on Facebook angered his local colleagues.
He had been working at the Kumtor gold mine, but had to be smuggled away after the incident.
When he arrived at Manas Airport in Bishkek, he was arrested by police under race hatred laws.
Mr McFeat said: "The police told me my act could send Kyrgyzstan to war with the UK."
After appearing in court and making an apology for his remarks, Mr McFeat was put on a flight to Edinburgh.
He added: "I was told there was a 17-page petition demanding I be jailed and the mine went on strike after I left, so they were making an example of me.
"I've always been up for a joke but this was one time I wasn't joking and it's been blown out of proportion."

Article text: Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said his party would oppose it, unless they were promised a second referendum on the UK's Brexit deal with EU leaders.
Several Labour MPs are also willing to vote against it, despite the Labour Party pledging not to do so.
The government says Lib Dem and Labour MPs are "trying to thwart and reverse the referendum result".
With the support of Conservative MPs and the support or abstention of most Labour MPs, the bill is well placed to pass through the Commons.
But the opposition of some MPs is likely to embolden critics in the House of Lords.
The Liberal Democrats have long called for a referendum on the outcome of the government's negotiations with EU, but only now have they said they will definitely vote against Article 50 if their demand is not met.
Mr Farron, whose party has eight MPs in the Commons, told BBC Radio 4's Today: "Article 50 would proceed but only if there is a referendum on the terms of the deal and if the British people are not respected then, yes, that is a red line and we would vote against the government."
For Labour, shadow minister Catherine West, former leadership contender Owen Smith and south London MP Helen Hayes all made clear they were prepared to vote against Article 50 - which begins formal exit negotiations with the EU - if amendments were not accepted.
Former Labour minister David Lammy and shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner have said they would oppose Article 50. Opposition whip Thangam Debbonaire said she would also vote against it, if a vote were held imminently.
The SNP's 54 MPs may join them. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said they will not vote for anything that undermines the will of the Scottish people, and has previously said they will vote against a bill to write EU provisions into British law to prepare for Brexit.
Dulwich Labour MP Hayes said she was prepared to defy Labour whips to oppose the measure unless the government promised a second referendum.
She said: "I had somebody in my surgery last week who was in tears because of Brexit and I see genuine distress amongst my constituents about what this path means.
"I would not be representing them if I voted to trigger Article 50 on the basis of no information from the government about the path that they would then take us on."
In posts on Twitter and Facebook earlier this week, shadow Foreign Office minister Catherine West wrote: "As I have said before, I stand with the people of Hornsey & Wood Green, and I will vote against Brexit in Parliament."
Owen Smith confirmed to Today that if his bid for a second referendum failed, he was likely to oppose the bill.
The SDLP's three MPs will also oppose the measure.
Ministers said MPs voting against Article 50 would effectively be trying to re-run the referendum in the hope of a "different answer".
"Parliament voted by a margin of six to one to put the decision on whether to remain in or leave the EU in the hands of the British people," said Brexit minister David Jones.
"Only the Conservatives can be trusted to respect the outcome of the referendum and make a success of Brexit."
Last week the High Court ruled Parliament must be consulted about leaving the European Union.
Unless the Supreme Court overturns the judgement in December, a bill to invoke Article 50 is expected in the new year.
Labour made clear its official position would be not to frustrate the process of leaving the EU after a newspaper report said the party leader Jeremy Corbyn intended to force a general election unless ministers caved in to demands.
After the story broke Labour sources said that while it would seek to amend the bill, it would provide "unconditional" support.
Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Labour would not frustrate the process and would not vote down Article 50.
However, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers will try to amend the bill in the House of Lords. So too will one Conservative peer - Baroness Wheatcroft.

Article text: Slovenia-born Bedene, who plays world number one Novak Djokovic in the third round of the French Open on Saturday, credits his work with Martin Skinner as the platform for his recent success.
"I was really unfit when I started to play grand slams," said Bedene, 26.
"Whenever I played a fourth set I was just losing them quite easily."
He added: "I remember once at the US Open, I lost 6-0 and I was struggling. I really wanted to improve on that.
"It obviously helps not only in the fifth set but also in the other tournaments."
Bedene is buoyed by Thursday's five-set, second-round victory against Pablo Carreno Busta when he recovered from squandering a two-set lead to advance at Roland Garros.
However, he lost his only other meeting with Djokovic in straight sets at the Australian Open in 2015.
He is hoping his experience of winning 16 Challenger and Futures events will stand him in good stead for the game, which is last on the main court.
"I love big crowds," he said. "I won a lot of Italian Challengers, and every time you play the final there are 1,000, 2,000 people, which is a lot for Challengers.
"So I did learn a few things. I know this stadium is bigger, but still you have to come from somewhere."
Djokovic has not hit top form yet and was given a tough test by qualifier Steve Darcis in round two, although he is still to drop a set.
The Serb is expecting more of the same against Bedene, who is being coached at Roland Garros by Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith.
"He's very talented, with a very quick motion for a first serve," said Djokovic. "So I'm expecting a tough one. I know he doesn't have anything to lose."

Article text: Fish oil has been marketed to women as a prenatal supplement.
But a 10-year study of more than 2,500 pregnant women found it did not improve babies' intelligence, according to the Australian research.
The findings suggested that fish oil might lead to slightly longer pregnancies, but that would require further research, the team said.
"If a pregnant woman has a healthy, balanced diet, then the baby's brain development is not going to benefit from having these fish oil supplements," study co-author Dr Jacqueline Gould told the BBC.
The research, by the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, followed women from their pregnancy to when their children were seven years old.
Participants were given either a daily fish oil supplement or a placebo.
The results found taking a 800mg dose of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 acid, had no impact on babies' intelligence.
Dr Gould said supplement makers had specifically marketed fish oil as a way to boost development in infants.
She said the research, detailed in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed fish oil might be linked with longer pregnancies.
"What that meant was, there were slightly fewer children born pre-term," Dr Gould said.
"We're currently trying to validate that in a much bigger study."

Article text: MEP Patrick O'Flynn said the party's support had broadened in the final days of the campaign and suggested their vote share would be more than 10%.
Earlier, deputy chairman Paul Nuttall said UKIP MPs could offer vote-by-vote support to a minority government.
But he told the BBC a referendum on the UK staying in the EU was a "red line".
UKIP is attracting around 14% support, according to the latest BBC poll of polls.
The party had two MPs at the end of the last Parliament - both of whom won by-elections after defecting from the Conservatives.
The party's leader, Euro-MP Nigel Farage, is standing for election to the House of Commons in the Kent constituency of Thanet South. Here is a full list of the candidates contesting the seat.
Speaking about UKIP's prospects, economy spokesman Mr O'Flynn said the party had managed to defy expectations of a squeeze.
He said: "Tomorrow we will significantly and perhaps dramatically outperform the expectations of pollsters and pundits alike.
What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
"That means doing much better than a political class consensus of a vote share of around 10% and one or two seats in the Commons.
"The so-called squeeze on the UKIP vote predicted by so many of the media class simply has not happened.
"On the contrary we are getting indications of a very substantial energising and broadening of our support in the final days of the campaign."
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Nuttall repeated that his party would not enter a formal deal after the election.
He said: "We've made it perfectly clear there will no coalitions, there will be no pacts, and if we did go down the line of a deal whereby we vote with the government on a vote-by-vote basis, it will be a loose deal."
He said a "red line" would be a "free, full, fair referendum" on EU membership "as soon as possible, preferably before the end of the year."
Mr Nuttall was asked whether a vote for his party could harm the prospects of Tory success and therefore an vote on the EU.
He said: "The problem you've got with Mr Cameron's promise of a referendum is one he's promised a referendum before and gone back on that deal and secondly he's talking about a negotiation through 2016 and into 2017 with an organisation that has made it perfectly clear that renegotiation isn't on the table."
He added: "We're looking to get as many votes as possible tomorrow to ensure we have real change in British politics, whether that's with the European Union or indeed electoral reform."

Article text: The application was approved on a majority vote at the organisation's congress in London, with no votes against and no abstentions.
The British Overseas Territory off the south coast of Spain has a population of just under 30,000.
Gibraltar will be allowed to enter qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
The territory tried to join Uefa in 2007 but the bid was controversially rejected. Spain opposed the move and threatened to boycott both club and international competitions if it succeeded.
Only three of Uefa's 52 associations voted in favour of Gibraltar - the English, Welsh and Scottish Football Associations.
Previously Gibraltar, which has six top-division teams and 600 registered senior players, had been told it could not join Uefa as it was not a country recognised by the United Nations.
It was accepted as a provisional member of Uefa in October 2012 and that membership has now been ratified.
Spain continues to claim sovereignty over the territory, which has been ruled by Britain since 1713 under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht.
The European Union has put pressure on Spain and Britain to resolve the issue of Gibraltar's status. Both sides, under the Brussels Process launched in 1984, have attempted to reach an agreement.
But Spain's insistence on eventually acquiring full sovereignty, and Britain's determination to retain full control of Gibraltar's military base, have been among the stumbling blocks.
Uefa president Michel Platini has confirmed that Gibraltar and Spain will be kept apart in qualifying groups.
"Gibraltar will not play qualifying matches with Spain - we also have this situation with Armenia and Azerbaijan," Platini said.
"This is a momentous occasion for football in Gibraltar. Uefa membership means that we can begin the next chapter of Gibraltarian football," the president of the Gibraltar Football Association, Gareth Latin, said.
"At last we'll be able to show the whole of Europe that we can match the best with football of a high standard and entertaining style."
Allen Bula, head coach of Gibraltar's national side, would relish the chance to play the country's neighbours.
"I always said I would love to play Spain. I would play them any day, anywhere, any time," Bula told the BBC's World Football programme earlier this year.
"When I took over the national team I had one purpose - to show Europe and the world that what Spain were saying about us, that we were only in it for political reasons and that we didn't have any quality, was a load of rubbish.
"They have not let us progress, we've never given up and now we are ready to show Europe what we are made of."
Gibraltar becomes the smallest Uefa member in terms of population, behind San Marino (just over 32,000), Liechtenstein (approximately 37,000) and the Faroe Islands (just under 50,000).

Article text: The 10km (four miles) sq area housing government buildings became off-limits to the public as a security measure in the wake of the 2003 US occupation.
It is the latest in a series of steps by Mr Abadi to ease sectarian tensions and crack down on corruption.
Baghdad has seen weeks of protests over poor services and abuses of power.
Earlier this month, in a rare show of unity, the Iraqi parliament backed Mr Abadi's programme to abolish top government posts and cut spending.
On Friday, the prime minister issued instructions to lift restrictions on the Green Zone. It is not clear when the plan will be implemented.
The compound, in the Karkh district on the west bank of the Tigris, is surrounded by concrete walls and heavily guarded by checkpoints and tanks.
It houses former palaces of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and was the administrative headquarters of the US occupation authorities. Several foreign embassies, including those of the US and UK, are situated there.
Most Iraqis have been excluded from the Green Zone unless they have special permission, and large bribes have been paid to get round stringent entry procedures, according to AFP news agency.
The zone has been targeted by bombings and rockets over the years, and the fortification measures were aimed at making it more secure, although attacks in Baghdad are still commonplace.
Mr Abadi also ordered the removal of barriers and checkpoints set up on main roads and sidestreets in Baghdad and elsewhere by prominent figures and militias.
The order to lift the restrictions is part of a series of measures to defuse tensions and root out corruption. A panel will also be set up to recover state property appropriated by elites which are found to have been illegally obtained.
In recent weeks, thousands of Iraqis have taken to the streets in Baghdad and other cities to protest against the failure to provide basic services and against corruption.
They have been backed by Iraq's preeminent Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and powerful Shia militia leader, Moqtada Sadr.

Article text: Since George Osborne applauded Google's tax agreement with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) two weeks ago, public sentiment has been mounting against what many feel are unduly favourable tax arrangements for the world's multinationals.
In front of MPs, Google's president for Europe, Matt Brittin defended the company's UK tax arrangements.  Its public stance has been that:  "Governments make tax law, the tax authorities independently enforce the law, and Google complies with the law."
In which case, the authorities in the UK and beyond seem to be concluding that what's required is a change in the law.
Chancellor George Osborne has already instigated a clampdown on the way multinationals shift their profits to different jurisdictions to pay less tax, known as the "diverted profits tax".
HMRC has said that the new tax, which came into effect in April last year, is aimed at capturing tax from organisations that don't pay corporation tax on their profits in the UK.
Google, says HMRC, has paid the taxes that it is supposed to pay.
Which, say critics, suggests this new tax doesn't go far enough.
Last month, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) successfully brokered an agreement designed to improve the current system.
All 31 of its member countries, which include the US, Bermuda and Guernsey, have agreed to share information on the tax international firms pay, leaving them less room for moving their profits into low tax jurisdictions.
But the plan would still require implementation at national level.
At the heart of the agreement is the concept of transparency, in particular what is known as "country-by-country reporting".
This would force companies to tell the tax office of each country in which they operate, how many staff they employ there, what their revenues and profit are and how much tax they pay.
The European Commission has proposed EU member states do the same.  If its plan is approved, which experts say is unlikely as any direct tax measures require unanimity, it could eventually be turned into law by individual countries.
The Commission has said it is also looking separately at whether these accounts should be opened up to public scrutiny and will publish its findings in the spring.
If such scrutiny were ever implemented, it could be a powerful incentive for firms to change, says Richard Murphy, professor of international political economy at London's City University.
"If multinationals feel that they are out of the public eye, then they feel they can carry on the same way with the tax authorities - and nothing changes.
"It is only by having their affairs in the public eye, when everyone can see the choices they are making and the press can have a field day, that you have behavioural change."
The prospect is already making investors nervous, according to Prof Murphy:
"Investors are crucial to this. They are beginning to question which companies are free-riding. If there is public scrutiny of their accounts that represents a real risk, it could result in a real change in perception of those companies."
Momentum appears to be building behind this idea. Even the UK government, having been criticised in the past for dragging its feet on the issue, has come out in favour of full transparency, with the chancellor telling the Financial Times he would like to see tax information made public as long as it can be agreed multilaterally.
However some in the business community are concerned.
"We recognise need for greater transparency and we share the common objectives to tackle fraud and evasion," says James Watson of the lobby group Business Europe which represents national business associations such as France's MEDEF and the UK's CBI.
"But we are concerned at initiatives that might make the EU a forerunner and create a competitive disadvantage.
"If companies feel they have to reveal more information and information that is commercially sensitive, that might damage the EU as an investment destination if the EU were to go ahead unilaterally."
For some, though, even the powerful incentive of greater transparency doesn't go far enough - they are calling for an overhaul of the system and the introduction of "unitary taxation".
This is a more radical solution to the problem that beset the UK while trying to tackle Google's tax affairs.
Google claimed that all its sales came out of Ireland, with the UK representing one of many marketing operations, and that it therefore made very little taxable profit in the UK.
But unitary taxation would see a company, however big, and however diverse, as one unit with one base and one profit.
Once the revenues and profits are added together they would then be broken down to represent the interests in each country, and the company would be taxed according to its activities there.
The European Commission has proposed a unitary tax system called the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), while both the US and Canada already have a form of unitary taxation for their corporations' domestic profits.
Sol Picciotto, emeritus professor at Lancaster University Law School, says treating multinationals as single entities makes sense, but that it can be difficult for countries to agree on how they work this out.
The most obvious formula, he believes, is to base taxation of profits on where a firm's assets, employees and sales are located.
"I think there must be some kind of change.
"The direction must be towards treating multinationals as single entities. Up until now they have been seen as a collection of independent entities, and I think that is a mistake," he says.

Article text: The parties are now in opposition together at Stormont.
Since going into opposition after the assembly election in May, the effectiveness of the arrangement between the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP has been constantly questioned.
The decision to invite Colum Eatwood to address the UUP conference can be seen as the response to that criticism.
Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said there was a lot of joined up work going on between the parties but he and Mr Eastwood were conscious people want to see tangible signs of co-operation.
Rather than dwell on what divides them, he said, they were focused on common ground, importantly the fact both want Northern Ireland to work.
Mr Eastwood said it was a demonstration of what genuine co-operation looks like - two leaders of parties with different views coming together in the interests of people who deserved better from the current Executive.
"It's the principle of partnership, ingrained in our institutions by the SDLP and UUP and degraded by the current government, that brings us together on issues of common cause where we can make a positive difference to the lives of the people we represent," he said.
Mr Nesbitt said that while there was a lot of co-operation between the UUP and SDLP behind the scenes, he was conscious that people wanted to see tangible signs of it.
"We will not agree on everything, but rather than dwell on what divides us, I am focused on the common ground, and importantly, the fact that Colum and I both want Northern Ireland to work, which opens huge possibilities for cooperating on the bread and butter issues of the economy, education, housing and the health of all our people," he said.

Article text: His side have won only two of their first seven league games following promotion and lie in seventh place.
"What I said at the start of the season, and I was very, very clear, was that we'd be highly competitive," the English manager told the media.
"You guys said about challenging Celtic and challenging Aberdeen."
Rangers are seven points behind reigning champions Celtic and three adrift of the Dons, who were last year's runners-up, after losing to both in recent weeks.
"I said we'd be highly competitive and that won't change," he said of a side beaten 2-1 at Pittodrie in their last outing.
"I think you saw on Sunday we were highly competitive, but we have to get the rewards for it.
"What we have to do is to turn our domination and ball possession into rewards.
"That's what we did against Queen of the South. Between the Ross County and Queens match, there was no difference between the displays, but in one game we were far more clinical than the other."
Warburton, who has received a one-match touchline ban for comments made after the loss to Aberdeen, insists it is still early in the season to express disappointment at Rangers' league position.
"You can say you are four points from the bottom or three points from second," he said ahead of Saturday's Glasgow derby against Partick Thistle.
"At this stage of the season, in any league, you win two games and the whole picture changes. The same if you lose two."

Article text: April Jones was playing with friends near her home in Machynlleth but was seen getting into a grey or light coloured van at 19:00 BST on Monday.
Around 200 people helped in a search of streets, farmland and woodland through the night.
April was last seen wearing a purple knee-length coat with a fur hood, white school polo top and black trousers.
The Ysgol Gynradd Machynlleth pupil had been playing on her bicycle with friends near her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate.
Dyfed-Powys Police said all the witnesses to her suspected abduction were children.
Det Supt Reg Bevan said getting information from the children would take time.
"It's a delicate and difficult process interviewing young children who were the witnesses to this," he said.
"That's continuing - it commenced last night and it will continue this morning and hopefully I will have more information for you later."
A hotline number has been released for people to call with information - 0300 2000 333.
Det Supt Bevan added: "We're liaising with our colleagues, neighbouring forces, [getting] specialist advice.
By Cemlyn DaviesBBC Wales
I've already heard shouts and cries of 'April' as the search resumed this morning.
I'm standing near the spot where the five-year-old was last seen around half past seven on Monday evening.
The community has really pulled together and that was clear last night.
A few hundred people gathered at the town's leisure centre.
I was there to watch them come together. They divided themselves into groups to go out into the town to keep searching for April.
This morning, I've spoken to the local councillors who have said they will do everything possible to help April Jones's family at this very, very difficult time.
They've described the family as a wonderful family who play their part in the community, and they'll do everything they can to help find April safe and sound.
"We've got specially trained family liaison officers supporting April's family."
He also praised the "tremendous response" from the community.
Local people gathered at Machynlleth Leisure Centre on Monday evening to help look for the girl, as news of her disappearance spread on social network sites.
Posters of April were also circulated and put up around the town.
Police also set up road blocks to check vehicles, while the street where April disappeared has been cordoned off.
Det Ch Supt Simon Powell of Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were "becoming increasingly concerned for her safety".
He said the force had launched an "intensive search and criminal investigation" into the abduction.
"April was last seen playing on a bicycle near her home address and was seen getting into what we believe was a light-coloured van which then drove off," he added.
Insp Kevin Davies said the fire service and police dog teams had been mobilised, and vehicle check-points set up.
"There is mention of a grey van, we're looking at that as one of the angles of inquiry," he said. "Nothing is being overlooked. It's an angle, it's an inquiry that we're pursuing along with other angles.
"We're searching the area.  Everything we can possibly do is being done.
"The family are obviously distressed. We're trying to keep them informed, we've got an officer allocated to them just to keep them informed as to what's happening. Any information, we'll share with them."
Shadow Welsh Secretary, Owen Smith MP, told the Labour conference in Manchester that the thoughts and prayers of all delegates are with the missing girl and her family.
"We all pray she's back in her community and with her family as soon as humanly possible," he added.
Meanwhile, Powys County Council said it was providing support for pupils and staff at April's school. Both the primary school and adjacent secondary school are open with lessons continuing as usual.
The council said refuse and recycling collections in the town had been suspended for the day, with the workers involved volunteering to join in the police search.
Machynlleth, an historic market town in countryside in the Dyfi Valley, has a population of around 2,100.
Search volunteer Anwen Morris said locals had searched an area with a 30-mile radius overnight using quad bikes and off-road vehicles.
Local people described the family as "very well liked" and said they had helped create a community garden on the town's Bryn-y-Gog estate, which has more than 100 homes.
Alun Hughes, a friend of the family, said: "We were out last night and at the moment we are waiting for the police to organise specialist searches of the town."
Brian Vaughn, whose daughter goes to school with April, described her as a "lovely little girl". He said: "Everybody just wants her back, really.
"Whatever we've got to do, we'll do it. We're just hoping for the best, that she's closer rather than further away."
Mayor of Machenlleth Gareth Jones, who was among those at the leisure centre, said people wanted to help the search in any way they could.
"We're all shocked, and it's the uncertainty of it all as well of course which is really worrying," he said.
"Our thoughts go out to the family, the close family and friends of April.
"We're all here to help as you can see by the amount of people we've got here this evening.
"Anything we can do, we will do it."
Machynlleth town councillor Michael Williams said people were "stunned".
Machynlleth is a quiet Powys market town.
Tourism is the town's major employment sector, with the countryside, along with its proximity to the coast, attracting people from across the UK.
Caravan and camping sites are dotted across the rural landscape and its rural setting and relatively slow pace of life has led to many visitors choosing to settle there in search of an alternative lifestyle.
The town, with its weekly market, remains one of the Welsh-speaking heartlands.
Crime is low with an average of 15 crimes a month reported in Machynlleth so far this year,  mostly for anti-social behaviour.
"I've lived here all my life and I've never heard of anything like this before," he said.
"The family must be devastated, and I hope to goodness the little girl is found without any huge delay.
Neighbour Rhydian Mason said: "Most of us I think have found out through social networking sites online like Facebook - that's where I first heard of it - and we all want to see what we can do to help.
"It's completely heartbreaking. I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of April's parents and it's an awful feeling in the pit of the stomach. We're all out here hopefully to see if we can get a positive outcome to this story, and we'll do our best even if we're out all night."
Dyfed-Powys Police have asked anyone with information to contact a dedicated hotline on 0300 2000 333.
