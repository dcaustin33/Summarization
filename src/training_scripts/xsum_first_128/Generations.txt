Article text: In a campaign tagged "We deserve better", about 1,000 people came out in the western city to chant "neither Le Pen nor Macron".
Riot police used tear gas to stop them reaching the historic city centre.
The far right's Marine Le Pen has spoken in Nice and centrist Emmanuel Macron visited a troubled Paris suburb.
Opinion polls taken since the first round on Sunday suggest Mr Macron, candidate of the En Marche (On The Move) movement, will easily beat Ms Le Pen, who has temporarily stood down as leader of the National Front (FN), in the second round on 7 May.
However, Ms Le Pen upstaged her rival on Tuesday when she turned up in his northern home town of Amiens just as he was visiting himself.
Ms Le Pen found herself under fire again on Thursday as EU sources accused her of defrauding the European Parliament of about €5m (£4m; $5.4m), allegedly paying FN assistants who were not really working for MEPs but were engaged in party work in France.

The polling average line  looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower.
In Rennes, between 950 and 1,500 demonstrators marched in the city centre, French media report, after a peaceful rally.
When a group of about 50 tried to occupy the railway station, police used tear gas and one officer cut off from the rest briefly drew his pistol to protect himself, Le Parisien daily reports (in French).
Unrest continued in the city centre, with police bringing in a helicopter to survey the crowd, AFP news agency says.
Placards read "Expel Marine Le Pen, not immigrants" and "We don't want Macron or Le Pen".
Other unrest was reported in the western city of Nantes and parts of the capital Paris.
Since Mr Macron and Ms le Pen narrowly won the first round on Sunday, some supporters of the losing candidates have advocated a protest vote against both on 7 May.
Mr Macron visited the deprived Paris suburb of Sarcelles on Thursday to meet local people in a stadium where he played football briefly with delighted children.
Sarcelles, home to large Muslim and Jewish communities, saw riots in the summer of 2014 in which Jewish-owned businesses and a synagogue were targeted.
Mr Macron accused Ms Le Pen of not being willing to visit "a district like this". "France is not hatred and rejection of others," he said.
Speaking later in an interview for the TF1 channel, he said France's biggest challenge was mass employment and it needed a policy "which allows companies to hire and invest".
He promised, if elected, fundamental reform of labour laws this summer.
Elsewhere in the interview, Mr Macron vowed to:
Ms Le Pen gave her first big rally of the second round in the southern city of Nice, which was traumatised by the Bastille Day lorry attack claimed by so-called Islamic State last year.
She accused Mr Macron, a former banker, of being the candidate of the "oligarch class" whose idea of France was a space where "everything can be bought and sold".
Portraying herself as a patriot to the cheering crowd, she said the election was a "referendum for or against France" and she promised to halt "mass immigration".
"I will give France back its borders immediately because I choose France," she said.
Describing Nice as a city "martyred by Islamist terrorism", she said she would show no "weakness in the face of Islamic fundamentalism".
The rally ended with a rendition of the national anthem, La Marseillaise, which was sung twice at Ms Le Pen's request from the stage. "Forward to victory, my friends!" she cried.
Local FN representative Lionel Tivoli told Reuters news agency earlier that party membership in Nice's Alpes-Maritimes region had jumped from 740 two years ago to 3,500-4,000 now, driven in particular by the attack.
However, sports coach Dominique Eche, 62, whose children narrowly escaped the attack, told Reuters:   "I saw the Nice attack from the inside and I find it appalling to try and benefit from such attacks, to say: 'It wouldn't have happened if I'd been in power'."

Article text: Staff were informed of the development on Friday by chief executive officer Thomas Mayer, a source told BBC Sport.
Administrators FRP said there was "a very limited window of opportunity" to save the team before the start of the 2017 season in Australia on 26 March.
FRP said it was "assessing options" and that the process affected Manor's operating company Just Racing Services.
Manor Grand Prix Racing, which owns the rights to the team's participation in F1, is not in administration.
Team owner Stephen Fitzpatrick said in a note to staff: "It was imperative that the team finish in 10th place or better in 2016."
Manor, who finished 11th and last in the championship last season, have been in talks with new investors but so far no deal has been concluded.
Administrator Geoff Rowley said: "The team has made significant progress since the start of 2015, but the position remains that operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment.
"The senior management team has worked tirelessly to bring new investment, but regrettably has been unable to do so within the time available.
"Therefore, they have been left with no alternative but to place [Manor Racing] into administration."
A source said several buyers had been lined up over the past few weeks and two had gone as far as conducting a due diligence process.
But none of them provided the funds necessary to buy the team, nor was there any proof they had the money to run it.
Fitzpatrick, the boss of the energy company Ovo, decided to put the team into administration on Thursday night.
FRP were also appointed the last time the team were in administration over the winter of 2014/15, after they collapsed with debts of £35m.
At the time, they were known as Marussia, and were reconstituted under their original name of Manor when Fitzpatrick bought them at the 11th hour just before the 2015 season.
Manor, who are based in Banbury in Oxfordshire, suffered a blow at the end of last season when Sauber moved ahead of them into 10th place in the constructors' championship thanks to the ninth place achieved by Felipe Nasr at the penultimate race of the year in Brazil.
"For much of the season we were on track," said Fitzpatrick.
"But the dramatic race in Brazil ended our hopes of [finishing 10th] and ultimately brought into doubt the team's ability to race in 2017.
"We made a huge amount of progress on and off track but ultimately it was not enough."
That cost Manor in the region of £10m in prize money - income they needed to survive into the new season - and the loss of it has made potential drivers and their backers reluctant to commit funds to the team, sources said.
Fitzpatrick said at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi that the loss of income was "not a deal-breaker" in the talks he was having with new investors.
But there had been no further news from the team until Friday's development.

Article text: It was jockey Ryan Moore's second win in the race, having ridden O'Brien's previous winner Gleneagles, in 2015.
Barney Roy (7-2) was second ahead of third-favourite Al Wukair (11-2) in the first Classic of the 2017 Flat season.
Frankel's offspring Dream Castle and Colts Eminent were fifth and sixth respectively over the mile distance.
The 1,000 Guineas, for fillies, takes place at Newmarket on Sunday at 15:35 BST.
Churchill, last season's champion two-year-old, was sitting third at the halfway stage and managed to get the first run on his main rivals as he won by a length from Barney Roy.
Moore said Churchill, who was making his three-year-old debut at Newmarket, had "everything you want in a racehorse".
"He has a magnificent mind, he travels, has speed and loads of class," Moore told ITV Racing. "He was always racing comfortably - he was there a little bit early.
"He always feels like there's more when you ask him."
O'Brien added: "I was very worried about it being his first run. He's a big horse and we knew he would come on for the run. Ryan gave him a lovely ride.
"Everyone at home was very happy with the horse which is why we took the chance to come first time, so I'm delighted."
BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
Am I the only one to feel a slight sense of anti-climax?
Obviously, Aidan O'Brien's latest record-breaking feat is a testament to the prolific skills and brilliance of himself, the rest of the Coolmore team, and, of course, of champion stallion Galileo, Churchill's father.
But as a race, I'm not sure. It was hardly the potentially epic showdown billed; the time wasn't great, and the first seven finished within about three lengths.
Churchill was good rather than sparkling, though it was his first run of the season. A word for Barney Roy who stumbled at a crucial moment late on.

Article text: The BHA aims to halt a decline in the number of horses taking part in races lower down the scale with an increase in prize money and appearance fees.
The scheme has the support of the Racecourse Association and Horsemen's Group.
The proposals come as the 2018 fixture list is released, with 1,508 meetings next year, 11 more than in 2017.
Richard Wayman, chief operating officer for the BHA, said: "Although there has been growth in total prize money in recent years, much of this has been at the top end. The returns to our sport's participants further down the scale are simply not sufficient at present to be sustainable.
"Targeting grassroots with extra funding will help racing's participants to maintain their involvement in the sport, keeping more horses in training, as well as helping with the recruitment and retention of staff to care for our horses."
The BHA proposes to invest additional levy income in racing from 2018, with the aim of delivering three key objectives for the sport - supporting ownership, delivering more competitive and compelling racing, and increasing customer engagement.
A statement by the BHA proposed that, in addition to the increased number on meetings next year, there will also be "customer-friendly slots on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons throughout summer with the aim of increasing attendances".
"We need the fixture list and race programme to work in a manner that meets our customer's requirements. As customer and betting habits change it is essential that our sport evolves with them," Wayman added.

Article text: Geoffrey Sutcliffe admitted causing the death of Lucille Abraham, 92.
When applying to renew his driving licence, a court heard, Sutcliffe said he met the "required eyesight standard" and did not need glasses to drive.
He was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years.
Sutcliffe hit Ms Abraham, from Baildon, at the junction of Godwin Street and Kirkgate, in Bradford, last October.
During an eye test the previous month, Prosecutor Michael Smith said, Sutcliffe told the optometrist he was not a driver.
Had he done so, Mr Smith said, she would have said that his eyesight had failed the visual acuity test.
"The defendant suffers from cataracts in both eyes and it seems that the medical opinion here is that he should not undergo an operation on his right eye because effectively that's the only eye that can see," said Mr Smith.
Barrister Ken Green, for Sutcliffe, said he had been driving for over 60 years without any previous offending and his client intended never to drive again and had surrendered his licence.
"He will never forget that day and I am sure he will never forgive himself for that error that he made," said Mr Green.
Passing sentence, Judge Colin Burn said "It is obvious that you should not, with the benefit of hindsight, have been driving at all on that day.
"Your eyesight wasn't up to it as a matter of objective fact."
He added: "The misrepresentation you made about your eyesight was a contributory cause of this collision because you shouldn't have been driving at all."

Article text: Chevron said the Alder project has already created hundreds of jobs across the UK, including in Aberdeen and Invergordon.
Gas produced from the field will be sent via a 17-mile (28km) pipeline to the ConocoPhillips-operated Britannia platform.
The Alder field was discovered in 1975.
Chevron said development was originally considered impossible due to the challenges of the field's reservoir, lying 14,700ft (4,480m) beneath the seabed.
The company said it was now viable due to the "right combination of technology, infrastructure for processing and export, and commercial conditions".
Chevron Upstream Europe managing director Greta Lydecker said: "First gas at Alder represents a significant milestone for Chevron and highlights our commitment to investing and developing resources in the UK.
"Alder supports our goal of helping maximize the economic recovery of the UK, adds significant production to our portfolio, and helps extend the field life of Britannia, an important asset to Chevron in the North Sea."
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of industry body Oil and Gas UK, said: "It shows the opportunities that are still out there."
She called for a "stable fiscal regime" to help boost investor confidence in North Sea exploration and production.

Article text: GCSE results are being changed to grades 9 to 1, with the first such grades to be published this week.
But there will be two different pass marks - grade 4 as a "standard" pass and grade 5 as a "strong" pass.
Researchers say pupils need to be at grade 5 to match global rivals.
The study from the Education Policy Institute says England's school system faces an "immense challenge" if it is going to match the levels of achievement in countries such as Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.
GCSEs in England are being made more challenging and will be decided by final exams rather than coursework, with the first results of these new-style GCSEs being published for English and maths this week.
These will be graded from 9 to 1, with a grade 4 being counted as a "standard" pass, similar to a grade C.
But the researchers say that on average pupils should be achieving a "strong" pass at grade 5, if England is going to keep up with international competitors.
At present, the researchers say, only 40% of pupils in state schools have reached this "world-class standard".
To keep up in maths, the study says, it would require an increase of over a third of pupils getting top grades and an average above grade 5.
"The old C grade is not an adequate national aspiration if England wants to compete with top education nations," says David Laws, former Education Minister and executive chairman of the Education Policy Institute.
"This analysis highlights the gulf between education outcomes in England and the performance of the world's best education nations," he said.
"In certain subjects, such as maths, England needs both to significantly raise the number of top performers and almost halve the number of low performers if it is to compete with the world's best."
Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: "This report shows that England's obsession with structural change, under a succession of governments, has had little impact on either standards or equity.
"Policy makers have routinely pursued the wrong priorities," said Mr Whiteman.
"The highest performing school systems are those that invest in their teachers and that respect and value education."
Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said that even if the overall results at national level were kept in line with previous years, individual schools "will still experience volatility in their results".
He warned that such volatility could have "unfair consequences".
There have been warnings about confusion over having two pass grades - with universities using different versions of a pass in their entry requirements.
Education Secretary Justine Greening had explained the plans for two pass grades to the education select committee earlier this year.
"I want to provide certainty about how this new grading will work and, in particular, the consequences for individual pupils of achieving a grade 4 or grade 5," Ms Greening had written to the committee chairman.
"Rather than reporting on the "good pass", we will instead distinguish between a grade 4 as a "standard pass" and a grade 5 as a "strong pass" and report on both."
A Department for Education spokesman said: "We know there is more to do and this report underlines the importance of our reforms to create new gold-standard GCSEs, benchmarked against the best education systems in the world so young people learn the knowledge and skills that will allow them to compete in an increasingly global workplace."

Article text: King Bhumibol Adulyadej has had a lengthy spell in hospital in Bangkok and has not been seen in public for months.
The king is widely revered and seen as an arbiter in the country's divided political arena.
Thailand is preparing to celebrate 70 years of his reign on Thursday.
The monarch was treated for narrowing of the arteries with "satisfactory results", the palace said in a statement.
Doctors performed a procedure known as balloon surgery to widen the arteries on Tuesday after tests had shown insufficient blood in the heart muscles, the statement said.
In the past month, the king has also been treated for a build up of fluid surrounding the brain and a swollen lung.
An X-ray on Saturday showed less fluid around the brain, the statement said.
The monarch's health is closely watched in Thailand as he is seen as a unifying symbol and pillar of stability in a society that has suffered increased political divisions and violence.

Article text: Khadija, Sugra and Zohra Dawood, from Bradford, and their children aged three to 15 have not made contact for a week.
Their brother is understood to be fighting with extremists in Syria.
The fathers' lawyer said the children said "we can't wait to come home" in a conversation before they went missing.
Balaal Khan said: "We've had no answers whatsoever, we don't know what's happened."
Newsnight reporter Secunder Kermani spoke to Khadija's husband, who said he wanted to tell his wife: "I love you, please bring the kids back".
The fathers - two of whom are in the UK and one in Pakistan - have been "distraught, crying, they don't know what to do", said Mr Khan, adding it was suspected the women had taken their children to Syria.
The fathers last spoke to their children on 8 June, when they were in the Saudi city of Medina, said Mr Khan, adding: "They said 'We love you, we're missing you, we can't wait to come home.'"
Mr Khan said it was feared the sisters had met up with their brother - but stressed that while family members had confirmed he was in Syria, he could not comment on what he was doing there.
The case follows the deaths of Dewsbury teenager Talha Asmal, who reportedly blew himself up in Iraq, becoming the UK's youngest suicide bomber, and Muslim convert Thomas Evans, 25, from Buckinghamshire, who was among al-Shabab fighters killed in an attack on a Kenyan military base.
Police have said they are "extremely concerned" for the family's safety and that enquiries are continuing on a "national and international level".
The Bradford family travelled to Medina on 28 May and were last seen in a hotel in the city.
They were supposed to fly to Manchester following their pilgrimage but the fathers reported them missing when they did not return.
There has been no contact with the sisters for one week. Their mobile phones have not been active, nor have their social media profiles been updated.
Travel agents confirmed that 10 tickets were bought for a flight on 9 June to Istanbul in Turkey, a commonly-used route into Syria.
Mr Khan said it was not known whether the family had boarded the flight - or if two children who were unaccounted for - five-year-old Nurah Zubair and her sister Haafiyah Zubair, eight - were still with the rest of their family.
He said it was hoped all of the family were together and that a "computer glitch" could explain why the two girls were unaccounted for. He said he had asked for CCTV footage from Medina and from Turkey.
The 15-year-old son Junaid Iqbal was acting as the family's mahram - an appropriate male responsible for the family - during the Saudi pilgrimage, he added.
However, Mr Khan told the BBC the family did not feel they were getting the answers they needed from police and that they wanted a "special task team" designated to the case.
Meanwhile, Bradford West MP Naz Shah said she had spoken to two of the fathers and they were "worried out of their minds".
"I asked them if there was any indication [this could happen] and they said absolutely not - it was a shock to them, it came out of the blue.
"At this time there is no contact, absolutely zero contact with the women or children. The last contact was a few days ago when they were due to leave."
West Yorkshire Police have contacted the Turkish officials but there have been no sightings or contact made in Turkey.
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "We are in contact with West Yorkshire Police and Turkish authorities and are ready to provide consular assistance."
A neighbour of the family in Bradford, Mohammed Saeed, said it would be "devastating" if the family had travelled to Syria.
"They can't grow up in that kind of area," he said. "You hear about it all the time. All these people going there. It's just a hellhole there isn't it."
And Bradford East MP Imran Hussain said: "We have nine children that are missing at the moment and in particular some very young children, three and four-year-olds, and we need to ensure the safe return of those children."

Article text: Crowds lined the route of the 24-hour torch relay which began in Stoke Mandeville on Tuesday night.
The relay ran more than two hours late but reduced breaks made up time.
A splinter flame was taken to the Stadium in case the delays were not overcome but the opening ceremony ran late and the flame made it on time.
A late-finishing ceremony in Stoke Mandeville and the time required for multiple exchanges of the flame between team members were blamed for the timing slipping throughout the relay.
Organisers Locog cut down on breaks and reduced the number of photo opportunities and a late-running opening ceremony meant the the flame was used to light the cauldron in the Olympic Stadium.
Crowds gathered in the market square in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to watch the start of the relay and thousands more turned out overnight along the route to cheer on the torchbearers.
After arriving in London, the flame, which is being carried by 580 torchbearers, was taken up the steps to Britain's first traditional Hindu temple, the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir temple in Brent, where a torch was lit at about 08:30 BST.
Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent, took part in a ceremony which involved pulling apart string made up of different threads and colours to "allow" the Paralympic torch through.
He said: "It was a very special moment. We have been waiting since 6.30am and the thrill and excitement is just fantastic. I don't think there has ever been a setting like this, for an Olympic or Paralympic flame."

The Paralympic Games are being talked-up a lot this year.
Channel 4 has put a lot of marketing and production effort into bringing the Games to a wider audience than before, with over 500 hours promised to UK viewers.
Important figures in sport and politics have stepped up to tell us that the Games will "dazzle" and "inspire". Seb Coe said those watching the sports would be "blown away".
But will we all want to see TV coverage of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi? Or the next summer Games at Rio 2016? And is there a worldwide clamour to push this recently unearthed disability agenda across the globe, or are we just feeling it more because it's our Games?
The significance of London 2012 Paralympics will be in the legacy and it might take a little while before we can fully appreciate the impact of that.

In Maida Vale a team of torchbearers was cheered by crowds as the flame was carried over the Abbey Road crossing, made famous by The Beatles album cover.
At London Zoo in Regent's Park the flame was held aloft in the penguin enclosure by torchbearers Adam Hollick, John Craig, Fiona Forsyth, Charlie Humphrys and Aruna Mahtani.
All members of the team, who were previously unemployed and have disabilities including spinal cord injury, blindness and impaired mental health, have trained and qualified as gym fitness instructors.
Former boxer Michael Watson, wheelchair racer Dame Tanni Grey Thompson and Paralympic swimmer Chris Holmes were in the team who carried the flame along Regent Street and through Piccadilly Circus.
Torchbearer Edward Parker co-founded the Walking With The Wounded charity, which raises money to support injured servicemen and women.
He was nominated to carry the flame by Prince Harry.
The 46-year-old from Norwich was joined by fellow nominees, his nephew Harry Parker, 29, who lost both his legs in Afghanistan and Captain David Wiseman, 29, who was shot while fighting the Taliban.
The charity's co-founder Simon Daglish, 46, and his son Felix Daglish, who has cerebral palsy also joined the team.
Edward Parker said carrying the flame was "a very special thing to be able to do. I felt a bit humbled by the whole thing. It was an amazing feeling."
He added: "It was great going past Horse Guards [Parade] and the Ministry of Defence. It means a lot to have their support."

Article text: Some people have been waiting up to three hours to clear passport controls, with freight traffic building up on roads approaching the Kent port.
A Port of Dover spokesman advised customers to allow plenty of time for their journey.
France has been under a state of emergency since last November.
The country's National Assembly voted to extend the measure by six months in response to last week's attack in Nice in which 84 people were killed and scores injured when a lorry was driven into crowds.
The state of emergency was brought in after terror attacks in Paris on 13 November that left 130 people dead.
Latest updates on the Port of Dover and other Kent stories
A P&O Ferries spokesperson said: "We are doing everything we can to allow passengers to begin their journey as quickly as possible.
"If passengers miss their allocated ferry they will be able to board the next available ferry at no additional cost."
Disgruntled travellers have taken to Twitter to express their dismay.
John Hippisley said "terrible PR for the French Authorities I appreciate the need to protect the border but clearly all tourist not terrorists".
The extra security checks have been causing delays since the early hours.
DFDS Seaways advised customers on Twitter at 13:00 BST that they should "allow 180 minutes to complete the check-in process... the port is very busy".

Article text: But his leadership of Cuba divided opinion, and leaders across the world have had to decide whether or not to attend the revolutionary's funeral.
In the end, the list of those wanting to pay respect Castro in person appears to be very short, with some notable allies choosing to send representatives instead.
So who is making the trip to Havana?
Perhaps most surprisingly, considering the two countries' long friendship, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will not be attending. His spokesman said he was too busy to travel to Cuba but that Russia would be sending a representative.
Less surprising is US President Barack Obama's decision to stay away. Despite the steps Mr Obama made towards fixing US-Cuban relations, Castro remains a divisive figure - not least for Cuban-Americans who fled his rule. The White House will not send an official delegation, but Mr Obama's pick for ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, and deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, will attend the commemorative event.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May, France's President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are all staying away. However, they will be sending government representatives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry will attend to represent the UK's Labour Party.
Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - whose late father Pierre was friends with Mr Castro - was one of the few Western leaders to release a message of condolences following the leader's death, but will not be attending. Governor-General David Johnston was attending Tuesday's commemoration.
China's President Xi Jinping paid his respects at the Cuban embassy in Beijing, saying the country had lost a "close comrade and real friend". Vice President Li Yuanchao is representing China at the commemorations in Cuba.
Despite their close friendship, Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang will also not be attending, sending National Assembly chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Nga in his place. The country will be holding a national day of mourning for Castro, however.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who paid tribute to an "iconic" world leader last week - will be sending his home minister but will not be flying to Cuba himself.
North Korea's Kim Jung-un will not be travelling to Cuba either, sending a delegation on his behalf.
The list of world leaders actually attending is relatively short.
A number of South American leaders will be making the trip: Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose late mentor Hugo Chavez had a special bond with Castro, Ecuador's Rafael Correa,  Bolivia's Evo Morales and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega have all indicated they will attend.
Also expected are Salvadorean President Salvador Sanchez Ceren and Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto.
At least two southern African presidents will also fly to Cuba, South Africa's Jacob Zuma, who has just survived a vote of confidence, and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, whose country has just brought in a new currency.
And it seems the European Union may be represented by just one leader, in the form of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Other notable Europeans attending include Ireland's Gerry Adams and Spain's ex-King Juan Carlos.

Article text: If the US team is right, they may have found a new route towards treating and preventing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's .
Their work, in the Proceedings B journal, lends weight to a scientific theory experts have been chasing for decades.
The story began in the 1950s on a small Pacific Island called Guam.
Many of the indigenous people who lived there - the Chamorros - were dying from a perplexing paralytic disease.
US Army doctors described symptoms similar to dementia, Parkinson's and motor neuron disease.
Post-mortem examinations revealed abnormal collections of proteins in the brain that can also be seen in patients with Alzheimer's.
Researchers began to look at the island environment and what the Chamorros were eating to see if there was any link.
And a hypothesis began to emerge that an environmental toxin called BMAA could be to blame.
Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine is made by bacteria found on and around the island.
Experts identified it in algae-rich pools of water and in the roots and seeds of the native cycad palm trees.
Fruit bats, known as flying foxes, a local delicacy, which feast on the cycad seeds, also harboured the toxin.
What was missing, until now, was experimental evidence that BMAA could trigger the telltale brain changes seen in the villagers.
So, Dr Paul Cox, from the Institute of Ethnomedicine, and colleagues from the University of Miami fed monkeys fruit laced with BMAA.
After 140 days, they all had abnormal proteins (tangles) in the brain.
The control monkeys, who received only regular fruit, had none of these brain changes.
Dr Cox repeated the experiment with more monkeys - 32 in total - and found the same.
"Every single one that had eaten the BMAA bananas developed the brain tangles," he said, "even the cohort given low-dose BMAA."
"If what we found in these animals holds up in man, then it means a few things.
"We need to protect people from this toxin.
"We have to get very serious about clean water supplies.
"And it may be possible to prevent some other neurodegenerative diseases."
Dr Cox has been focusing on motor neuron disease - a progressive condition that attacks the nerves.
Working with Dr Ken Rodgers and Dr Rachael Dunlop in Sydney, his team has found BMAA mimics an amino acid called L-serine and inserts itself into brain proteins, causing them to misfold and tangle.
And clinical trials are testing whether giving patients L-serine tablets might prevent this.
"We do not know if it will work, but we really hope so," Dr Cox said.
Dr Laura Phipps, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "This research in animals suggests that BMAA exposure could directly lead to hallmark features of neurodegenerative disease, providing new insight into the likely cause of this condition on Guam.
"While investigating rare forms of dementia can lead to insights into the more common causes of the condition, further research is needed to understand whether the findings have relevance to diseases like Alzheimer's or motor neurone disease in other parts of the world.
"The research suggests that L-serine could reduce the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain associated with high levels of BMAA exposure.
"There are early stage clinical trials for L-serine in motor neuron disease, and similar trials would be needed to explore whether L-serine could have any benefit for typical forms of Alzheimer's, not associated with the toxin.
"There is currently no evidence to suggest that taking L-serine supplements could help improve symptoms in Alzheimer's disease."
Most cases of Alzheimer's are caused by a mix of age, genetic and lifestyle factors.
The risk can be cut by:

Article text: The 24-year-old scored his third try in four games before teeing up debutant Rory Hutchinson to edge Saints 14-13 ahead at half-time, after Olly Woodburn had crossed to put Exeter in control.
Chiefs retook the lead after the break, with Gareth Steenson passing 2,000 points for the club to make it 19-14.
But Harry Mallinder kicked two late penalties to snatch victory for Saints.
Despite trailing for much of the contest, Northampton were good value for their win - a result that meant they avoided losing three successive home games for the first time in five years.
While France flanker Louis Picamoles caught the eye as a potent ball carrier and hard hitter, it was the brilliance of North that turned the game on its head in the space of three first-half minutes.
With his side trailing 13-0 early on, the former Scarlets back side-stepped his way inside for a trademark finish to reduce the deficit and then superbly set up Hutchinson after a jinking run straight from the restart.
Exeter, losing Premiership finalists in May, remained in touch after the interval and still looked on course for victory thanks to Steenson's accuracy from the tee.
But Mallinder, son of Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder, landed a 78th-minute penalty to give Saints their second win of the season.
Northampton Saints forward Courtney Lawes:
"Harry is growing as a player, he is learning from every mistake he makes - unfortunately when you are young you do make a lot of mistakes. He is growing as a character in the team and he is a brilliant player, he did fantastic today with unbelievable composure to get the win at the death.
"We were desperate for that win and I think it really showed out there - we came back twice.
"We really back ourselves, we know we have been playing in patches and if we can string it together for the full 80 minutes there are not many teams who can live with us. We are just looking to stop these lapses of concentration."
Exeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter:
"We never really grabbed control in that final quarter. There was an opportunity to squeeze the game out, but crucially we needed to hold up a bit better in the line-out, that is where we lost possession and it started to get a little bit messy.
"We looked a little bit too edgy in that final quarter, we didn't really look like the team going out to win the game and we were on the back foot for too long.
"There was a pretty clear block that opened up some space in their second try, but that is a bit churlish, we missed a couple tackles and sometimes when you get bumped it is because you are not focused."

Article text: NVA has concluded missives with the Catholic Church for St Peter's Seminary in Cardross, Argyll and Bute.
The A-listed building was designed and built in the 1960s as a training college for priests but it has not been used since the 1980s and is now a ruin.
NVA aims to restore part of the seminary and use it as an art space.
Its plan would stabilise the structure and gradually restore some interior spaces for cultural and educational use.
The charity has already received £100,000 from Creative Scotland's National Lottery Fund towards the project.
It still needs to raise £2m by 2013 to take its proposals forward.
St Peter's Seminary was designed by Glasgow architects Gillespie, Kidd and Coia.
The Roman Catholic seminary, which belonged to the Archdiocese of Glasgow, was completed and consecrated in 1966.
The distinctive zig-zag design and concrete appearance soon brought architectural recognition to the site.
However, as numbers entering the religious life fell and with high maintenance costs, the decision was taken to close the college.
In 1980 the seminary was deconsecrated and fell into a state of disrepair.
The building was Category A listed by Historic Scotland in 1992.
The World Monuments Fund, which works to preserve endangered cultural landmarks, added St Peter's College to its register in June 2007.
