All article text:Jonathan Martin has been claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers. Aday after his release from the San Francisco 49ers, the offensive tackle joins his third NFL franchise in three years. Martin was a second round pick for Miami in 2012 and was at the centre of the Dolphins bullying scandal. He was abused by team-mates Richie Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey and left the franchise in October 2013. Jonathan Martin heads to Carolina after drawing a close to his one-year stint with the San Francisco 49ers . Martin joined San Francisco last year and played 15 games at right tackle. The 25-year-old joins Michael Oher, who came to Carolina in free agency after a year with Tennessee, and the returning Mike Remmers on a revamped offensive line. 'Our goal is to build the strongest roster possible and add competition at every position,' Carolina general manager Dave Gettleman said in a team release. "Jonathan brings quality experience to our offensive line, having started 32 games in his career at both tackle spots.'' Carolina also strengthened their receiving corps with the addition of Jarrett Boykin on a one-year deal.

All article text:A man who was brutally beaten and left for dead after witnessing his mother's murder is still fighting for justice 36 years on - and says he knows who is responsible for her death. Eric Garrett, from Muncie, Indiana, was just four when a man entered the home he shared with his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, on March 25, 1979 and savagely beat them with a blunt object - killing her and fracturing the little boy's skull. A few weeks later, when he was finally well enough to speak with police, he named the attacker as Richard Green, his mother's on-off boyfriend and a married father-of-four. Even though prosecutors concluded Green was not responsible for the attack, Garrett continues to stand by his childhood claim, while neighbors have also recounted the couple's troubled relationship. Witness: Eric Garrett, pictured left, is calling for a new investigation into the 1979 murder of his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, right. He says he saw her boyfriend in their apartment before the attack . 'This case isn't unsolved, it's just unprosecuted,' Garrett, now 40, told NBC News. Paula Garrett and Green had met at the restaurant where Paula worked as a waitress and the night before her death, he was at her apartment, investigators told NBC's Dan Slepian. Green told police that he left late that night and then visited her apartment the following afternoon, where he came across her body. He then alerted neighbors. But family members told NBC's Dan Slepian that Green had been possessive and abusive, and that Paula had been trying to break up with him at the time of her death. A neighbor, Larry Smith, added to NBC that he often heard the couple fighting and the night she was killed, he heard Green shout: 'You think you're going to get away with this?' The following day, Green barged into Smith's apartment and told the neighbor that Paula had killed herself, he said. When Smith rushed into the apartment with Green, 'I immediately realized this was no suicide', he said. 'Blood was everywhere.' He also noticed that her son was covered in blood on the ground but was opening his eyes. He picked up the boy's limp body - all while Green did nothing, Smith said. When Eric was well enough to speak to police, he named the man and picked his photo from a lineup. He told NBC that he had been sleeping when Green walked in and switched on the light, giving him a good view of his mother's killer. But a defense team today would raise issues with Garrett's claims, considering his age, the passage of time and the injuries he sustained in the attack, experts told NBC. Questions: No one has ever been charged in the murder of Paula Garrett, left, or the attack on her son Eric, when he was four. Her boyfriend was initially arrested but was freed after passing a lie detector test . Two months after the death, Green was arrested and charged with his girlfriend's murder, although he protested his innocence. His wife and children also stood by him. During a bond hearing, a neighbor testified that they saw Green rushing away from the home around 3am on the night of the murder. He underwent two polygraph tests, both of which he failed. But there were questions over how the tests were carried out so police took him to Chicago for a further test. After taking it, Green went to the restroom and escaped police custody. The next day, after it emerged he had passed the third test, police spoke to him on the phone and convinced him to turn himself in. He was taken back to Indiana where prosecutors dropped the charges - to the anger of police, The Star Press reported. Despite the decision, Eric's father, Robbie Garrett, said that his son maintained Green 'sent my mommy to heaven'. In 1981, the case was turned over to a countywide homicide investigation team after a grand jury decided the original probe was 'incomplete and one-sided'. The city later withdrew this decision. Prosecutor Michael Alexander told NBC that there was no specific evidence indicating Green was the killer. He suggested that the killing could have been motivated by a robbery or a sexual assault. Testimony: Neighbors said they often heard the young single mother, pictured with her son, arguing with her boyfriend, while one testified that he saw the boyfriend, Richard Green, near her apartment that night . 'I was pretty well convinced he didn't commit the crime based on evidence at the scene,' he said. 'I didn't like the idea of charging someone on phony evidence.' Police officers from the original case and members of Eric's family have since called for officials to reopen the case, and Delaware County Prosecutor Jeff Arnold said that he has met with Eric and has asked police to look for further leads. But right now there is no new evidence to bring charges, he said. After the attack, Eric, who was struck as many as 15 times with the blunt object, was left with partial paralysis on his right side and still has nine dimples on his head where his skull was fractured. He was raised by relatives and graduated high school. He still lives in the area with his dog. Green refused to speak with NBC and his daughter told reporters to stop contacting them.

All article text:A 21-year-old man has undergone the world's first successful penis transplant. The 'ground-breaking' operation took South African surgeons nine hours to perform, and allowed the patient to urinate normally and become sexually active again. Three years ago the man, who remains unidentified, was forced to have his penis amputated after a botched circumcision. Each year thousands of young men, mainly from the Xhosa tribe in South Africa, have their foreskins removed in traditional rituals, with experts estimating around 250 losing their penises each year to medical complications. Scroll down for video . A 21-year-old man has become the first person in the world to undergo a successful penis transplant, in a nine hour operation at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa . The operation was carried out by surgeons from Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, using a penis donated from a deceased person. They said the procedure allowed the man to regain all function in the newly transplanted organ. Nine more patients will now receive penile transplants. Professor André van der Merwe, head of the University's Division of Urology, said they were surprised by the patient's rapid recovery. He said: 'Our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery. Professor Frank Graewe, another of the hospital's surgeons who assisted on the operation, said: 'It's a massive breakthrough. We've proved that it can be done – we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had.' 'It was a privilege to be part of this first successful penis transplant in the world.' Professor van der Merwe said  having a penis amputated is known to have a seriously adverse psychological effect on men. 'This is a very serious situation,' he said. 'For a young man of 18 or 19 years the loss of his penis can be deeply traumatic. As part of the procedure, doctors transplanted a new penis, donated by a deceased man. The pictures, left and right, show the veins and blood vessels they connected . After the nine hour operation, the man recovered rapidly. The procedure has allowed him to become sexually active again. The picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man's genital region . He doesn't necessarily have the psychological capability to process this. There are even reports of suicide among these young men.' He added that finding a donor organ was one of the main challenges to the procedures, and called the man who donated his penis, and his family, 'heroes'. The procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical South African hospital. The planning and preparation for the study started in 2010. After extensive research Professor Van der Merwe and his surgical team decided to use techniques developed for the first facial transplant. The operation was the second time that this type of procedure was attempted, but the first time in history that a successful long-term result was achieved. Image shows the nerves in the donated penis, which were joined to the man's groin area. This was the first successful operation of its kind, as a previous attempt did not lead to long-term recovery . A man in China received a transplant in 2005 but that man asked surgeons to remove the new organ two weeks later. Professor Van der Mewe said the procedure could eventually also be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last-resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction due to the side effects from medication. The South African Government praised surgeons who performed the operation. Dr Beth Engelbrecht, head of Western Cape Government Health, said: 'We are very proud to be part of this ground-breaking scientific achievement. 'It is good to know that a young man's life has been significantly changed with this very complex surgical feat. 'From experience we know that penile dysfunction and disfigurement has a major adverse psychological effect on people.'

All article text:A Premier League footballer's son was one of two boys expelled from a leading public school after they allegedly stabbed 15 other pupils with a used needle, causing an HIV scare. The pair, both 14, were dismissed from the school in south England after claims they found a used diabetes pen, which normally tests levels of glucose in the blood, belonging to a pupil before attacking their classmates with it. School authorities alerted the police and public health officials, who recommended that the students be tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV, it is claimed. Fifteen pupils at a leading public school have been tested for HIV after they were allegedly stabbed with a needle used by diabetics to test the level of glucose in the blood by two 14-year-old pupils . The father of one of the expelled pupils is a star with one of the country's top football clubs, according toThe Sun. The shocking incident happened last month when the teenagers jabbed their classmates in a prank gone wrong. They used the needle of the diabetes pen, believed to have been left behind by someone with the condition, which is usually used to test levels of glucose in the blood. Teachers immediately called the police and public health officials, with affected students undergoing emergency tests. The police took no further action but the boys were expelled. A spokesman for the school said: 'We can confirm that an incident took place at the school last month involving a diabetic testing pen. 'The incident was extremely concerning and as soon as we became aware of it all parents of pupils involved were contacted immediately and given the advice received from public health experts. 'While the risk of infection was low or negligible, children affected were advised to have blood tests all of which proved negative.'

All article text:The bodies of five dead babies have been found hidden in a house in France - four in the freezer and one in a portable cooler. Police made the macabre discovery after a 40-year-old father called them at 7am in the town of Louchats, in the south west, close to Bordeaux. In what is believed to be the worst case of infanticide in the country this century, the farmer first of all said he had found a tiny body in the thermally insulated container, one normally used to keep cold drinks. Police officers enter the home where the bodies of five babies were discovered in France . Officers searched the premises, and found four more babies in a large freezer regularly used by the family. The man's wife was immediately sedated and rushed to hospital, while the husband, who is a farmer, was arrested so he could be questioned at length. Neither has yet been identified. 'The first body was a newborn,' said a source close to the investigation which has been opened into the horrific case. It is believed that the woman had 'secretly given birth, within the last 48 hours', without telling anybody. The husband was said to be 'absolutely devastated and shaking uncontrollably' when the discoveries were made. The couple have two daughters, aged 13 and 15, who were thought to have been present when the first body was discovered. They are now in the care of the police, supported by social workers. There will be DNA tests to confirm the children's parentage. Locals who had seen the woman recently said there were no signs that she was pregnant. And a relative of the father said that he was not aware either and was in a state of complete shock at the discovery of the dead babies. The town's mayor Philip Carreyre, who went with police to the scene, said: 'I will not say anything about this. The only thing I can point out is that these are good people perfectly integrated in the town.' The father runs a small business maintaining gardens. Police were called to the address (pictured) after the 40-year-old father called them about 7am . Officers searched the premises, and found four more babies in a large freezer regularly used by the family . Pathologists need to establish whether the babies, all apparently self-delivered in secret, were stillborn or died soon after birth. The first baby found in a cool bag was 'viable' (capable of life) it was revealed tonight. Deputy Prosecutor in the High Court of Bordeaux, Anne Kayanakis, told a press conference: 'It is not yet possible to say whether this was a full term birth. Further analysis is needed to determine the cause of death.' Post mortems on the four other newborns discovered in a freezer will take place tomorrow. Depending on the results prosecutors will determine the nature of any criminal charges. 'Nothing has been established,' said Kayanakis. 'This is a particularly heavy and delicate investigation and a highly serious matter.' She said biological and genetic analysis was on going to determine the relationship of the babies in the case. But she said, the mother had immediately admitted to police giving birth to the child two days before he was found. She had now been placed in a psychiatric hospital. The tragedy, in Louchats, France, is believed to be the worst case of infanticide in the country this century . Meanwhile In Louchats, villagers were still in shock at the news that has unfolded. The couple and their two daughters were described as 'just a normal family.' Said one resident: 'Knowing them it is just unbelievable. They are discreet people who never posed any problems. Just people who get up every morning and go to work. 'We're all just stunned.' The bodies of five dead babies have been found hidden in a house in Louchats (shown in this file picture) in south west France . France has a sinister history of dead babies being found in freezers. In 2013 a 32-year-old waitress from Amberieu- en-Bugey, in the east of the country, admitted drowning her two newborns and placing their bodies in one. She had previous convictions for similar crimes and was sentenced to 15 years for infanticide. Her mother, who had helped her in the crimes, got an 18 year sentence. In November 2012 a three-month-old boy and a five-year-old girl were found dead in a freezer in Vienne, Isere. The mother was also found dead, while the father fled to Tunisia. And in March 2003 police in Tinteniac, Brittany, found the body of a new-born baby in a freezer and the remains of three other children buried in the garden of the house. The mother was later given a 15-year prison sentence. Such cases are often linked to 'pregnancy denial', where women refuse to accept that they are in fact pregnant.

All article text:A man who lost an incredible 390lbs just through good old-fashioned diet and exercise, and beat his chronic alcoholism without any treatment or support, has turned to a crowdsourcing website to help him with the final part of his journey. Brian Flemming, a 32-year-old music teacher from Canton, Michigan, is now barely recognizable as the 625lb man he used to be - but his massive weight loss has left with him between 30 and 40lbs of excess skin. 'It's a constant reminder of my past and it gets in my way every single day,' Mr Flemming, who is asking for $22,000 in donations for skin removal surgery via GoFundMe, tells Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . On display: Brian Flemming, a 33-year-old music teacher from Canton, Michigan, is barely recognizable as the 625lb man he used to be, but his massive weight loss has left with him between 30 and 40lbs of excess skin . Aid: Mr Flemming, who hopes he can pay for his skin removal surgery with donations from his GoFundMe page, lost an incredible 390lbs through good old-fashioned diet and exercise . In a YouTube video to assist the campaign, Mr Flemming - who was at one point guzzling a fifth of vodka (25 ounces) every night and chowing through 'well over 7000 calories' daily - bravely removed his shirt to show viewers the extent of his excess skin. 'This is something I'm very uncomfortable showing,' he admits in the video. 'I don't go out in public like this, and I haven't gone swimming in over a decade because I'm too ashamed really.' Mr Flemming says his rib cage sticks out as a result of it expanding to push his former weight away from his organs. He also displays a lymphodema on his inner thigh, which used to be a 'pocket of fat' but has now detached from the rest of his body and will need to be surgically removed. Beat his demons: Mr Flemming, pictured before (left) and after (right) his massive weight loss, beat his chronic alcoholism without any treatment or support . Immense progress: At one point, he was guzzling a fifth of vodka every night and chowing through 'well over 7,000 calories' daily . As he is today: These days, Mr Flemming can fit his entire frame into one leg of the pants he used to wear when he was obese . Before Mr Flemming began his weight loss journey, he was pre-diabetic and had been struggling with depression and alcoholism. 'My typical fast-food meal was a double cheeseburger with a large pop and large fries,' Flemming wrote on fitness blog Beyond The Miles. 'That usually wasn't enough, so I would have chicken nuggets with it as well. I also ate Arby's frequently. Large roast beef sandwich, large curly fries and drink, and a side of mozzarella sticks. I ate fast food every day,' he added. In the spring of 2012, Mr Flemming was playing Draw Something, a Pictionary-inspired app, which randomly matched him with Jackie Eastham, a woman 20 years his senior in London. He began chatting with Ms Eastham, who has myotonic muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes progressive wasting of the muscles. To manage her condition, Ms Eastham follows an extremely healthy lifestyle, and never takes her well-being for granted. A friendship grew, and Mr Flemming began to confide in her about his weight problems, and about his drinking - a secret he had kept even from his parents. He was expecting sympathy, and admits he was thrown by what was actually a brutally-honest response. 'She told me that I was wasting my life and that I should be ashamed that I was throwing it away when there are so many people out there who are fighting to stay alive, herself included,' Mr Flemming wrote. On October 13, 2012, he made the decision to quit drinking cold-turkey, and to drastically change the rest of his life too. Friendship: Jackie Eastham, a London-based woman 20 years his senior (left) who he met online in of 2012,  inspired Mr Flemming (right) to turn his life around, after she told him bluntly that he was wasting his life . Demo: Mr Flemming displays his excess skin (left) and what his arm will look like once the skin has been removed (right) New hobbies: In a bid to get fit, he began by simply walking in place for five minutes, then started running, and now, Mr Flemming in an avid cycler . 'Quitting alcohol was the most difficult step for me,' he tells Daily Mail Online, before advising that anyone else planning to stop drinking should consult a doctor about it first, because quitting cold turkey – like he did – can be incredibly dangerous. 'I wasn't aware of how bad the withdrawals were going to be, so the first few days were like torture,' he recalls. 'I had cold sweats and couldn't sleep. I also found myself fighting extreme boredom at first and it really helped having Jackie to talk to.' Still, Mr Flemming managed to quit without the assistance of rehab or a support group, and has been sober ever since. 'I think AA is a great support for people, but it never really appealed to me,' he remarks, adding that he is an atheist. 'I'm not a spiritual person and I don't really like the idea of surrendering my will to a "higher power". 'I like to think that I am in control of myself and it is all up to me.' Leaps and bounds: Mr Flemming, pictured (left) with Ms Eastham and (right) at a race, has something of an 'addiction' to running, and his next goal is to run a full marathon . Overhaul: 'I cut out all processed sugar and red meat,' says Mr Flemming, pictured before his weight loss. 'I limited myself to 1,400 calories per day for a long time' Once Mr Flemming had kicked the bottle, he began to address the rest of his lifestyle. 'I cut out all processed sugar and red meat,' he says. 'I limited myself to 1,400 calories per day for a long time. It was difficult at first, but it taught me to choose foods that were low in calories, but filled me up. I ate chicken breasts and rice quite frequently.' In a bid to get fit, he began by simply walking in place for five minutes. 'I did it little by little,' Mr Flemming states. 'I started walking outside and could barely make it around the block and I added to that little by little. Eventually I walked my first mile.' With Ms Eastham cheering him on by phone, Mr Fleming got to the point where he was walking five miles every morning. 'I dropped 100lbs over three months. It came off really fast. I was over 350lbs still when I started running in little increments at a time,' he says. 'The snowball was now rolling downhill and couldn’t be stopped,' He also began cycling 44 miles to and from work every Friday. Mr Flemming has since developed something of an 'addiction' to running, and his next goal is to run a full marathon. Getting thinner: Mr Flemming remarks, 'I dropped 100lbs over three months. It came off really fast. I was over 350lbs still when I started running in little increments at a time' Just friends? As for his relationship with Ms Eastham, and whether it ever turned romantic, Mr Flemming remains coy and simply says, 'we are very close' Mr Flemming and Ms Eastham began a website and a Facebook group, Team 383, to motivate others to achieve their weight loss goals. 'Brian has become a mentor and motivator to many throughout his journey and plans to continue paying it forward in the future, with the hopes of going back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety,' the GoFundMe page reads. 'If we manage to exceed Brian's goal, he has graciously offered to donate funds to Muscular Dystrophy charities in honor of his mentor.' As for his relationship with Ms Eastham, and whether it ever turned romantic, Mr Flemming remains coy. 'I always tread lightly around this,' he says with a smile. 'We are "very close".'

All article text:As  romantic comedy Pretty Woman celebrates its 25-year anniversary this week, the film's scriptwriter has revealed that the iconic fairy-tale ending could have been very different. The 1990 film, which is set in Los Angeles, sees Julia Roberts as Vivian, a down-on-her-luck prostitute who agrees to become a one-week escort for wealthy businessman, Edward Lewis, played by Richard Gere. The much-loved movie ends with the improbable pair going off in the sunset together - yet the original  ending was more realistic and was intended to reflect his story's 'dark and gritty' tone. Scroll down for video . The iconic necklace scene may have remained, but Pretty Woman was originally titled $3,000 and had an ending where the lead characters, Vivian and Edward, do not end up together . Edward and Vivian's clumsy-but-cute first-meet on Hollywood Boulevard never happens either. In the original script, Edward is seen to patrol around  intentionally looking for a prostitute . American screenwriter J.F. Lawton, who penned the original script, which was called $3000 for the amount Edward agrees to pay Vivian for a week of her company, revealed in an interview with Vanity Fair that: 'The tone and ending are completely different.' Most notably, in Lawton's original script Vivian and Edward do not find true love together. Indeed, Pretty Woman's Cinderella ending that sees Edward as a modern-day knight in shining armour, who 'rescues' Vivian from her apartment block would have been completely different. Instead, Lawton says: 'The film ends with Kit [Vivian's prostitute friend] and Vivian on a bus bound for Disneyland... with Kit anticipating a fun day financed by Vivian's week with Edward, as Vivian 'stares out emptily ahead.'' This dismal ending was just one of the many changes that happened. Lawton's script also portrayed  Vivian as a drug addict and the six pages include focus on her locking down a deal to buy crack cocaine. The original script dictates that Pretty Woman ends with Vivian and Kit on a bus bound for Disneyland as Vivian 'stares out emptily ahead'. There is no 'knight in shining armour' scene for Vivian (pictured) In the original script, Vivian is a helpless drug addict that must use prostitution to fund her crack addiction . Upon clocking the original script, even Julia Roberts described it as, 'a really dark and depressing, horrible, terrible story about two horrible people. She said: 'My character was this drug addict, a bad-tempered, foulmouthed, ill-humored, poorly educated hooker who had this weeklong experience with a foulmouthed, ill-tempered, bad-humored, very wealthy, handsome but horrible man and it was just a grisly, ugly story about these two people.' The lead characters' adorable meeting on Hollywood boulevard is no romantic affair either. The film's version portrays Edward comically and clumsily unable to drive his borrowed sports' car and stopping to ask for directions from a chirpy Vivian, who thinks he's a potential customer. In the original script,  Edward is very much looking for a prostitute when he stumbles upon Vivian . Pretty Woman stars reunited on NBC's Today show this morning, left to right: Hector Elizondo, Laura San Giacomo, director Garry Marshall, presenter Matt Lauer, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere . Pretty woman! The original scriptwriter has admitted that the ending could never have stayed the same 'dark and gritty' way once the film was cast, as Richard Gere and Julia Roberts 'just light up with each other' The iconic shopping scene where Vivian is given Edward's card and goes on a limitless shopping spree never happens in the original script . In the film,  Richard Gere's character Edward is constantly looking out for Vivian and even enlists the help of shop assistants to help her with her new wardrobe. In the original script he never tries to protect Julia Robert's character Vivian. He instead cruelly offers her up to his friend as if she were just a possession . And magical shopping scene, with the soundtrack of  Roy Orbison's catchy Pretty Woman? It never happens. The moment where Edward defends Vivian's honour by hitting his sleazy friend Stucky - who assaults her in Edward's hotel suite - is also a missing component in the original script. Instead Edward demeans Vivian and offers her up to his friend as if she were a possession: 'You want her? I don't mind. You want to try her?' While the last words that the couple ever say to each other in the first  script are definitely more than a little depressing. Rather than defend her from his sleazy friend, the  script sees Edward offer Vivian up like a piece of meat . The movie version sees Vivian having the confidence to gun for a relationship with the businessman before taking off to start a new life off the streets. Inspired by her, he jumps into his white limo to declare his undying love, asking, 'So what happens after he climbs up and rescues her? She replies: 'She rescues him right back.' They then kiss passionately on the fire escape as the credits roll. In the unrevised story, Edward is supposed to drag Vivian from his car, callously throwing her on the ground, where he first picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. He throws money at her and heartlessly gets back in the car, saying: 'You'll regret it tomorrow if you don't take it. You'll regret it the minute I drive away.' Vivian responds by screaming at him: 'Go to hell! I hate you! I hate your money! I hate it!' In the unrevised script, Richard Gere never 'rescues' Julia Roberts with roses up her apartment ladder, but instead throws her heartlessly from his car and chucks money at her . The original script show the heated and horrid final exchange between the two characters, who clearly never end up together . Lawton's script became hot property after it was pitched to Disney's production company, Touchstone. But after it was given a large budget and big name director Garry Marshall it was largely rewritten as a rom-com. Lawton suspects this rewrite was partially down to the casting of the leads Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. 'They had auditioned Al Pacino, they had auditioned Michelle Pfeiffer, and it would definitely have been a different movie if had it been Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer,' he said. Julia Roberts described her original character as 'this drug addict, a bad-tempered, foulmouthed, ill-humored, poorly educated hooker,' rather than the lovable and talkative Vivian in Pretty Woman . The Pretty Woman cast reminisced about making the movie 25 years after it came out on NBC's Today Show . Julia Roberts and Richard Gere have a laugh as they remember filming the 1992 blockbuster rom com . 'It might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending. 'But the chemistry between Julia and Gere, it is palpable on the screen, it was palpable in auditions. 'You can't really see how it could end any other way, because they just light up with each other,' the screenwriter admits. Garry Marshall agreed, and has also revealed that he had a set vision for what he wanted his fairytale rewrite to capture. Marshall admitted: ''My vision was a combination of fairy tales. Julia [Roberts] was Rapunzel, Richard [Gere] was Prince Charming and Hector [Elizondo - who plays the kind hotel manager] was the fairy godmother.' Even before the rewrite, Marshall described the film as a story about 'a girl who wanted to change her life, and did'. TITANIC: At the end of the film, instead of the elderly modern-day Rose dropping the iconic 'Heart of the Ocean' necklace into the sea without a word to anyone, she stands with the treasure hunter and launches into a cheesy speech about life being the only priceless thing. Then she drops the necklace into the sea. THELMA & LOUISE: Instead of the film ending mid-air during Thelma and Louise' death dive off the cliff  - which gives connotations of freedom and spirit - the car is seen violently tumbling down the mountain in a deathly fiery blaze. SWEET HOME ALABAMA: Rather than the tame ending where the couple kiss and then celebrate with their friends, an alternate ending sees Josh Lucas carrying Reese Witherspoon's lifeless body into the party. He is about to announce her sudden death, when they both reveal it's a tasteless joke...  Only then do they live happily ever after. ROCKY BALBOA: In the film, Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is defeated in his comeback fight by his younger and fitter opponent (a realistic offering). Whereas Rocky is victorious in the alternate ending. DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY: The Average Joe's team wins in the actual film, but an alternate ending sees them lose. This was changed after test audiences reacted badly to this first unhappy ending. At the end of the actual film, Ben Stiller references this by saying 'You happy now?'

All article text:British Islamic State hostage John Cantlie twice tried to escape his terrorist captors and suffered 'weeks and weeks' of torture as a result, a freed ISIS prisoner has revealed. Cantlie's punishment for trying to flee the Sunni extremists was so severe that the journalist almost drowned during one waterboarding session in northern Syria. Both of Cantlie's attempts to escape ISIS were carried out with the American journalist James Foley, who became the first Westerner to be beheaded on camera by the terror group's British executioner-in-chief Mohammed Emwazi - also known as 'Jihadi John' - last August. According to the former prisoner, during one of the escape attempts,  Foley, 40, had the chance to escape but refused to take the opportunity after his friend Cantlie, 43, was caught by the guards. Ordeal: British ISIS hostage John Cantlie (pictured in an ISIS propaganda video) twice tried to escape his terrorist captors and suffered 'weeks and weeks' of torture as a result, a freed prisoner has revealed . Tragic: Both of John Cantlie's (left) attempts to escape ISIS were carried out alongside American journalist James Foley (right). During one of the escape attempts, Foley, 40, actually had the chance to flee the prison but refused to take the opportunity after his friend Cantlie, 43, was caught by the guards . Sick: James Foley (left) became the first Westerner to be murdered by the terror group's British executioner in chief Mohammed Emwazi, also known as 'Jihadi John', (right) in a shocking filmed beheading last August . The details of Cantlie's punishment were revealed by Javier Espinosa, a Spanish journalist who was held by the radical Islamists between December 2013 and March last year. Mr Espinosa, a correspondent for Spanish newspaper El Mundo, wrote in the Times: 'Foley and Cantlie tried twice. The first was a failure before it started. They were caught trying to get off their handcuffs with a skeleton key they made. 'On the second occasion, the American showed his true humanity. After getting out of the room where the prisoners were, he had to wait for Cantlie who was to escape second. 'The guard saw that Cantlie (had freed himself) and Foley could have tried to escape on his own, but gave himself up. "I couldn't leave John on his own", Foley said. 'The attempts by Foley and Cantlie caused them weeks and weeks of punishment. Blow after blow. Attempted drownings. More blows. "They were literally trying to kill us for weeks until they realised that we had given up trying to escape", Cantlie had said.' Cantlie, who has been held captive for over two years, has appeared in multiple propaganda videos for the extremist group, often dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sitting behind a desk. Foley was the first of several hostages to be beheaded in a video posted online by ISIS last August. Film: Cantlie last appeared in a documentary-style production titled From Inside Halab, the ancient name for the Syrian city of Aleppo, reporting on a range of topics including education, drone strikes and Sharia law . Forced: John Cantlie, who has been held captive for over two years, has appeared in multiple propaganda videos for the extremist group, often dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sat behind a desk . Story: Details of Cantlie's punishments were revealed by Javier Espinosa, a Spanish journalist who was held along with his colleague Ricardo Garcia Vilanova (left) by ISIS between December 2013 and March last year . Freed: The moment journalist Javier Espinosa was reunited with his son on the tarmac of a Spanish airport after spending months in captivity, held by ISIS terrorists . Three British teenage jihadists were in custody last night after a dramatic security operation stopped them joining Islamic State fighters in Syria. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Turkey after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned at a high-security London police station on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. But last night they were released on bail. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'They have been bailed to return to a central London police station pending further inquiries.' Investigators hope to discover how they planned to reach the war zone and why they decided to try to do so. The case highlights the difficult balancing act the security services face in dealing with would-be jihadists desperate to sign up to the militant Islamist cause. The details of the escape attempts follow hints by Cantlie that he suffered waterboarding - a torture technique associated with America's CIA - in a propaganda video released by ISIS. In the fifth episode of a series titled Lend Me Your Ears, released in November, he said: 'Now, unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State. 'Some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors, as Muslim prisoners are waterboarded by their American captors.' Cantlie last appeared in a documentary-style production titled From Inside Halab, the ancient name for the Syrian city of Aleppo, reporting on a range of topics including education, drone strikes and Sharia law. The hostage seems well in the film released last month, appearing dressed in black trousers and a brown coat, although he ominously described it as 'the last in this series'. Mr Cantlie's father Paul, 80, died from complications following pneumonia last year. His sister, Jessica Cantlie, has previously appealed for 'direct contact' with the militants holding him. ISIS has posted a number of videos of hostages being murdered, including British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning last year.

All article text:As we approached another huge rapid, I had to pinch myself for a second. White-water rafting had been on my bucket list for years but to do it with Ben Fogle in the middle of the Amazon is a moment I will never forget. Hurtling along the Jatunyacu River in between steep mud cliffs with the loud buzzing noise of the jungle I felt like I was starring in my own version of Jurassic Park. ‘You can just imagine a teraductile flying overhead,’ Ben quipped. ‘The light, the scenery, the air, the people, it’s really unlike anywhere else in the world’. Trip of a lifetime: I was lucky to join adventurer Ben Fogle on a tour of Ecuador . Satey briefing: Ben watches on as our white-water rafting guide Gabriel gives us the lowdown . Setting sail on our Amazon adventure: Ben and I, on the right of the boat, receive instructions from our guide . I was invited to accompany 40-year-old Ben on a trip to the country where his life of adventure and travel all started. Ecuador has long-been associated as a gateway to the much more popular Galapagos Islands or simply a pit stop on a tour of South America. But from the bustling city of Quito to the stunning Andes, the Amazon jungle and the sublime beaches, it's much more than that. Ben’s first trip as an 19-year-old, unable to speak a word of Spanish, saw him spend a sobering night in a Quito prison cell and endure 15 rabies injections in his stomach after getting bitten by a dog. However the incidents did little to phase Ben as he says it was that trip that he decided he wanted to make a career out of travel. ‘I never believed I would do it,’ says Ben, husband to Marina and father to Ludo and Iona. Taking a breather: I prepare for the next stage of our descent down Cotopaxi volcano . The food: 'Guinea pig intrigues me. I'm still trying to master it. I’m an animal lover so actually one of the hard things I always have is embracing local food.' The people: 'In the South American countries the people are very friendly. The weather: 'We went from the Amazon where it was very hot to the chilly Andean Mountains. The light and sky is incredible in Quito.' Favourite moment: 'I've done white-water rafting a few times but this time was really amazing.' Weirdest moment: 'Getting whipped by nettles in the middle of a market near people eating their chicken and rice was a strange but memorable experience.' Scariest moment: 'When I first came to Ecaudor I was arrested and put in a  cell for a night for not having my passport on me. I was also bitten by a dog and had to have loads of painful rabies injections in my stomach!' The changes: 'Ecuador has changed unimaginably since I first came here. The infrastructure has vastly improved and it’s so much more geared to tourists.' ‘It’s gone in a strange convoluted way. It’s hard being away from home but I love my job. I love meeting people and exploring and experiencing new places.’ It was a place on BBC reality show Castaway in 2000 that propelled Ben into the spotlight. Since then he's raced 160 miles across the Sahara desert, rowed across the Atlantic Ocean with Olympian James Cracknell and presented numerous programmes including Countryfile, Crufts and Extreme Dreams. For the last 18 months he's also become a Worldwide Touring Ambassador for Virgin Holidays and using his vast experience he helped curate the itinerary for this trip. He's packed a lot into his 40-years but tearing down Cotopaxi Volcano on a mountain bike was a first for us both. He climbed the mountain as a teenager but this time took a more exhilarating route down. He said: ‘Everyone assumes I love everything but if you look at the history of all the adventure things I’ve done like they are usually slow. It was a bit scary but that’s what makes it so fun.’ Next up was a spot of horse-riding at the historic Hacienda San Augustin de Callo, which is built on the site of an Inca Palace. The current owner, glamorous Mignon Plaza, inherited the property from her grandfather, Leonidas Plaza, two-time president of Ecuador. Food for thought: Cow hooves and roasted guinea pig are popular local dishes in Ecuador . Llama selfie: I grabbed one of the friendly animals for a quick photograph . Llamas roamed around the hotel’s beautiful cobbled courtyard so I grabbed one for a selfie. Adventure sports aside we also took in the culture of the magical country. The voyage started in Quito, the highest capital city in the world, perched at 3000m on the eastern slopes of Pichincha, an active volcano. The Casa Gangotena Hotel, situated in the old town overlooking the Plaza De San Francisco, was a great place to recharge our batteries and adjust to the altitude. Joining  local travel film Metro Adventures we enjoyed a walking tour of the historic centre, a Unesco World Heritage Site, which features 40 colonial churches and chapels, including the stunning La Compania de Jesus church which is decorated in gold. 160 years in the making: The stunning La Compania de Jesus church was painted in gold leaf by hand . Bizarre medical practice: Ben Fogle gets his torso whipped by Señora Rosa in San Francisco market . I also witnessed bizarre scenes at the nearby San Francisco market where local healers whip willing punters with stinging nettles to raise energy levels. Ben took the plunge, stripping down to his underpants in between displays of meats from cow hooves to llama and paying $10 for the privilege. Afterwards angry red welts covered his body. He said: ‘It was a very strange but memorable experience. She said a had bad energy and a lethargy and a problem with my breathing which could be the altitude or from my recent bout of pneumonia. 'Maybe it was the relief of escaping the nettles, but I had a spring in my step and felt revitalised as I left the market.’ Flying the flag: Ecuador's national colours are seen above the Government Palace in Quito's Plaza Grande . Perfectly maintained: The beautiful Plaza Grande in Quito is a place for locals and tourists to relax . We also dropped in more unique local businesses including the famous sweet shop Las Colaciones De La Cruz where we tried our hand at sugar-coating peanuts in a wooden bowl over a hot fire. Carrion’s Restorations is a bizarre business which restores baby Jesus dolls while also doubling up as a facility to treat people with skin conditions. Jesus dolls are traditionally kept in the lounge of all of the Catholic households in Ecuador. Typically they are dressed in the occupation of the family members with a Jesus doctor, a construction worker and even a soldier with a gun among those we saw on sale. We also took part in a culinary masterclass at chocolatier Chez Tiff located in the Calle La Ronda art district. Strange tradition: Jesus dolls are sold wearing the traditional dress of various occupations . The area is home to lots of local artists and a place for children to play with games including hula hooping lining the main cobbled colonial street. After spending time in Quito we visited Guamote’s local market where thousands of indigenous people, dressed in traditional ponchos and hats and accompanied by pigs and llamas on leads, descend every Thursday. One of the busiest corners of the market was a café selling guinea pig. Previously faced with tarantula and rattle-snake, animal lover Ben admits this typical Andean cuisine still mystifies him. Ice cream break: Dulce Place in Calle La Ronda specialises in unusual flavours such as white corn . ‘Guinea pig intrigues me’, he said. ‘I don’t think it’s the tastiest of meats but the locals genuinely love the taste. It’s not something I’ve mastered yet. It’s very fatty.’ Locro (potato soup), Ceviche and a meat selection dinner, served on a hot volcanic rock which you then use to BBQ the food yourself, are other popular dishes we experienced on our journey, mixed down with a Canelazo, a traditional Ecuadorian drink of warm spiced cinnamon mixed with tequila. Cow foetus is also a delicacy in Ecuador but we steered clear of that. Each mealtime we quizzed Ben on his adventures and can report he is much more fun that I had imagined, even trying to help one young man in our party score a date on Tinder. Local life: Locals in traditional ponchos and hats descend every Thursday to Guamote market . Devil's Nose train: The route, which costs £15 per person, offers beautiful views of the Andes . Our tour also included an 800-metre descent on the Devil's Nose train, which zig zags down the spectacular mountainside on the route between Quito and Guayaquil and a trip to the lush hot springs in Papallacta heated from nearby Coxopaxi. Getting lost in the Amazon was an added bonus that was not on the itinerary. Due to a mix up with collection points after our rafting experience, myself, the Virgin Holidays PR and two fellow journalists found ourselves stranded along the edge of the Jatunyacu River. Impressive: Huge bridge which crosses the Jatunyacu River had a Jurassic Park vibe . Out of this world: Ben and I check out the Jatunyacu River before we go white-water rafting . Amazon life: Carly Reed, our lovely Virgin Holiday PR, and I meet the locals . QUITO . Casa Gangotena Hotel . RIOBAMBA . La Andaluza Hotel . BANOS . Samari Spa Resort . PAPALLACTA . Termas Papallacta . Activities arranged by Metropolitan Touring . The 11-day Andes to the Amazon tour with Virgin Holidays is available from £3645pp. For more details visit Virgin Holidays . With no shoes, phone, water or sun cream, we used our broken Spanish to mingle with locals and have a beer. When our mortified tour guide turned up three hours later we were almost disappointed. Ben, who had earlier dashed off to eat whittchety grubs at a local Amazon community during the incident (as you do), told us such moments are what adventuring is all about. He said: ‘I am an optimist so I always see the positives in everything. You got to experience a little bit of local life in the Amazon which is amazing. ‘An adventure is all about taking yourself out of your normal routine and experiencing something new.’ I couldn't agree more.

All article text:(CNN)Kids, being kids, like to climb on things. More often than not, that's OK. But when the thing in question is a war memorial? That's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington. The photographer, Matt Munson, described the shot on Facebook as "two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran." The parents, he said, were laughing. "It actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before I could take a picture of them all," Munson wrote. "The more I look at this photo the angrier I get." He has plenty of company there. As the photo went viral, comment after comment poured in on Facebook and Twitter, chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue, part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier. One nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet. The third looks skyward, to a rescue helicopter or perhaps God, according to the memorial foundation's website. In Munson's photo, a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair. The older man, wearing a Navy ballcap, and a woman also look on. The children's parents aren't shown. Disgusting. "Disgusting," Facebook user Trisha Davidson wrote of the children's actions. "So wrong," Twitter user karsonwithak chimed in. But not everyone was upset. "I fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that," Reddit user z3k3 wrote. But the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of World War II "loved watching the kids play on the local memorial." "He saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little," z3k3 wrote. Fair enough, some said. But some memorials are meant to be interactive. Others aren't. And a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just doesn't seem to be the place for play, a Reddit user with the screen name nickfree wrote. "Unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly 'use me, interact with me, to help carry my message' (e.g. memorial benches), the default is leave it respectfully alone," nickfree wrote. On the Mommyish parenting blog, associate editor Maria Guido wrote that "there's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some." "If these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- I wouldn't find anything wrong with the image, actually. But they're not," she wrote. "These parents were disrespectful," she wrote. "The kids were being kids and following their directives." Though the National Parks Service, which operates the memorial, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect. "Please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation's veterans," the group wrote on Facebook. "We hope our visitors understand this moving forward."

All article text:Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin is in line for a new contract following his breakthrough into the first-team. The Gunners want to tie the right-back down to a new long-term deal after a string of impressive displays in replacing the injured Mathieu Debuchy. Bellerin's current deal expires in 2017, but he is now set to extend his stay at the Emirates Stadium. Hector Bellerin has been in the Arsenal first team of late, and will be rewarded with a contract extension . The young defender is now a key part of Arsene Wenger's first team squad after some impressive displays . It is common practice at Arsenal to hand improved contracts to young players who make a consistent impact on the first-team. The 19-year-old has made 17 appearances for the club already this season, firmly establishing himself as a regular member of Arsene Wenger's first-team squad. The news casts further doubt over Carl Jenkinson's career at the Emirates Stadium. With Mathieu Debuchy out injured, Bellerin has become the club's reliable full back ahead of Calum Chambers . Bellerin started against Manchester United in the FA Cup, as Arsenal rely on him to fill in for Debuchy . The right-back is currently on loan at West Ham, with the east London club are keen to turn his deal permanent. And the emergence of Bellerin, as well as last summer's capture of Debuchy, has pushed Jenkinson further down the pecking order at Arsenal. And the Gunners are likely to listen to offers for the full-back at the end of the season. Carl Jenkinson (left), on loan at West Ham, will be offered to other clubs after falling down the pecking order .

All article text:Aston Villa face a major FA inquiry, a substantial fine and the threat of a ground closure after West Bromwich Albion players appeared to be assaulted as the FA Cup quarter-final at Villa Park descended into chaos with an unrestrained pitch invasion joined by thousands of Villa fans. In alarming scenes, which were a throwback to the football hooliganism of the Seventies and Eighties, West Brom players were left defenceless as fans rushed on to the pitch. Scorer Fabian Delph claimed he was bitten, while Boaz Myhill, Craig Dawson and Callum McManaman all appeared to be barged aggressively, and the latter seemingly struck on the back of the head by one fan as Dawson attempted to shepherd him off. VIDEO Scroll down to see the moment a match official ran for his life during pitch invasion . Aston Villa supporters stormed the pitch following the club's FA Cup victory over West Brom on Saturday . Police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after Aston Villa booked their place in the semi-finals . The Midlands club could face an FA probe after hundreds of fans stormed the Villa Park pitch . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way off the field following the full-time whistle . In a comprehensive breakdown of crowd control, Villa fans had even invaded the pitch in injury time with their team leading 2-0, with referee Anthony Taylor having to stop the game and West Brom forced to play the final minutes with fans spilling on to the pitch and gathered on the touchline. On the final whistle, thousands of fans came on and even Villa players were threatened by the melee. Villa captain Delph, who scored the first goal in the 2-0 win, said: 'It was very, very scary. My armband got nicked, some got my boot but I could appreciate the relief the fans are feeling after a result like that. People tried to kiss me, and were biting me. It was dangerous.' Villa seemed to exacerbate the problem by playing the celebratory song 'Que Sera Sera' over the PA while fans were still streaming on to the pitch, and put a video of fans celebrating on the pitch on their official Twitter feed. Meagre numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play . A club statement read: 'The club does not condone supporters invading the field of play under any circumstances. 'We are very disappointed that what should have been a very memorable and proud moment for our fans was marred by the actions of those who could not control themselves. 'They have let both themselves and their club down. 'The club extends its sincere apologies to the Football Association, the West Bromwich Albion directors, manager Tony Pulis and all his staff and players.' West Brom manager Tony Pulis said: 'It's disgraceful. We don't want to see those scenes. They've beaten us and for that to happen, that's just mindless idiots. If you're Villa, you need to look at the stewards as they came over to our fans and there was nobody there. 'Aston Villa should look at the stewarding. It's a quarter-final, it's a full house and you know it's going to be tasty. So you should have stewards both ends of the pitch. 'Supporters were coming on with a few minutes to go. They were congregating at the ends anyway a few minutes from time, so it puts player at danger and you don't want to see that. We were seeing that in the Seventies and Eighties and we don't want to see that. 'I'm sure the FA will look at it without be poking my nose into it. If you ask me from a football point of view, if you had a load of stewards then it would be sorted out. Most of the grounds in the Premier League are well stewarded. I'm sure Villa are disappointed this has happened.' Scorer Scott Sinclair (second left) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates Ashley Westwood and Jack Grealish . Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood admitted he could understand the fans' emotions after the victory . Asked whether any West Brom players had been assaulted, Pulis said: 'I don't know. I didn't ask them. Everyone looked as though they had their heads and arms on. They looked OK to me. They got in, intact. It's happened. I'm more concerned with trying to stop it before it happens.' West Midlands Police confirmed on Sunday that they had arrested 17 men for various public order offences, including one on suspicion of assaulting an officer, and authorities are also investigating an incident in a nearby pub before the game. A police statement read: 'We carried out a large policing operation for the FA Cup yesterday evening (March 7) to ensure supporters could enjoy the game in a safe environment. 'During the course of the operation 17 men were arrested for various public order offences. An investigation has been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the Witton Arms pub. 'Anyone who saw what happened should contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. 'We will also be supporting the Football Association to identify people involved in pitch invasions that happened at the end of the match.' The FA, who are believed to have had a 'crowd control advisor' present, will begin investigations tomorrow, asking Villa for their observations and their plans for stewarding. West Midlands Police will also submit evidence and the report of referee Taylor will be taken into consideration. Though Villa had a significant presence of stewards by the West Brom fans, there were far fewer by the Holte End where the Villa fans sit and they were quickly overcome by the scale on the invasion. West Brom boss Tony Pulis believes Aston Villa need to look at their stewarding following Saturday's incidents . Fans sing and chant on the pitch following Aston Villa's win during what has been a disappointing season . The FA can impose a range of sanctions from ground closure to fines, if the club have been considered negligent. There is no prospect of Villa being thrown out of the tournament but any ground closure or reduction in capacity could affect the team in their fight against relegation. The most likely outcome would seem to be a fine in the region of £100,000. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood said: 'I didn't know West Brom players had been hit. I can understand the emotions of the fan beating their local rivals twice in a week but you can't condone fans coming on the pitch. We don't condone it, especially if anyone was touched. 'What can you do? The stewards did their best. I saw them rugby tackling a few guys. But when they're coming in such numbers it's difficult to stem it. 'It has been a good week. I'd rather talk about the football. The players want to dedicate the victory to the fans because they've had some hard times here. And we're going to need those fans. It's been a very good week but here's stil a lot of hard work and we need those fans every step of the way.' Mark Lawrenson, who was co-commentator for BBC1's coverage added: 'It's like a scene from the 1980s all over again. Absolutely ridiculous.' West Brom fans also acted irresponsibly, ripping out several seats in the away section and launching them onto the Villa fans below when Scott Sinclair scored the second goal. Goalscorer Fabian Delph claims fans nicked his captain's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion .

The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name due to government policy, said Trevino Morales, 41, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey. The Mexican government had offered a $2million reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges. Scroll down for video .

Morales, also known as Z-42 is taken under custody to the Attorney General Office's hangar at the airport . The US Drug Enforcement Administration, which had Morales on its 'Most Wanted' list, had offered a $5million reward for his capture on cocaine-trafficking charges. Trevino may also face charges for several abductions and murders. Trevino's give name is Alejandro, but he has had multiple aliases and nicknames, including 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42.' The arrest of Morales comes just days after the capture of Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the the most wanted capo still at large in Mexico.

Soldiers escort a man who authorities identified as Omar Trevino Morales, whose aliases include 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42' The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent organized crime group. Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano 'El Lazca.' ‘Omar Trevino was the heir to all the Zetas who were going down,’ said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel, claiming upwards of 100,000 lives since 2007.

Once the flashpoint for the worst of the violence, security in northern Mexico has improved considerably, except for the lawless northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, said Raul Benitez. Founded in the late 1990s by deserters from an elite Mexican army unit, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the powerful Gulf cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest criminal syndicates in Mexico. But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in Mexico's drug war.

Pete and Jennifer Schultz, who live in the Kansas City, Missouri, suburb of Raymore, say they need the playhouse for their 6-year-old daughter, Ella Joe, because her health keeps her from playing with other children. 'She's earned this — she deserves it,' Pete Schultz told The Kansas City Star. 'She can't get out and play with other kids. This playhouse is what she would have. Is it really going to hurt someone?' Scroll down for video . Ella Joe Schultz of Raymore, Missouri is battling leukemia. When Make-A-Wish asked what she would like she asked for a playhouse, but the local homeowners association said no. Ella Joe and her family live at this home in Raymore, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, and had wanted to erect a 'barn-style' playhouse outside it . The Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children with life-threatening illnesses, contacted Ella Joe's parent offering to grant a wish to Ella. The young girl said she wanted a playhouse and at first everything seemed to be going well. The shingles of the house were even going to match the ones throughout the neighborhood. But the homeowners association said no. 'The proposed plan they've given us is a violation of our covenants,' Stonegate HOA board president Stacy Bayers told KCTV. The homeowners group has since published a statement on its website saying the proposal for a 'barn-style' playhouse was denied because it didn't have enough details to merit an exemption. 'Our hearts are with Ella Schultz and her family as they battle this terrible illness,' it read. 'She's earned this — she deserves it': Father Pete Schultz said his daughter asked for the playhouse because she can't get out and play with other kids . Stonegate HOA board president Stacy Bayers told KCTV that the initial request was turned down because it violated covenants . The Stonegate of the Good Ranch is committed to working with the Make-A-Wish Foundation 'to see if we can figure out a way to make Ella's wish come true,' and the group has requested additional information from the charity and a construction company that has committed to building the play house. One local man has even offered via Ella Joe's GoFundMe page to put her playhouse in his yard. As this plays out, Ella Joe has been in the hospital fighting complications from her cancer. The Schultz's neighbors have rallied around the family before, including last year, when after spending several months in the hospital, Ella Joe came home to a neighborhood parade.

All article text:Stone Age farmers in Italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in Puglia, south eastern Italy. These cuts and scrapes, made with stone tools, suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave. Many bones, such as this fibula, found in the Scaloria Cave showed fine cut marks made with stone tools . Archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process. Dr John Robb, a reader in European prehistory at the University of Cambridge, and his team say it might have been a way of returning the bones to their stone like origins. In 3,800BC a young couple were buried together in a final embrace that was hoped to keep them together for all eternity. Now the remains of the man and woman - who are said to have died in their twenties - have been uncovered in the Diros Caves in the Peloponnese region of Greece. An archaeologist leading the excavation of the ‘underworld’ cavern described the find as ‘stunning’ and said it is possibly the oldest grave ever found in the country. The remains were initially unearthed in 2013 and have now been analysed using radiocarbon dating. The results of the analysis showed the bones belonged to a man and a woman, both aged between 20 and 25, dating back almost 5,800 years. The cavern is known as Alepotrypa - or 'foxhole' - and was found in the 1950s. Experts believe hundreds of people lived inside Alepotrypa before the entrance collapsed burying everyone alive. They say that many of the stalactites in the cave resemble bones themselves and the floor of the cave is littered with long, thin broken stalactites. Farmers from villages up to 12 miles away are thought to have brought their dead to the Scaloria Cave in the Tavoliere region of Italy. Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Robb and his colleagues said: 'Neolithic people at Scaloria Cave engaged in a varied range of funerary practices including primary burial, skull removal and redeposition, and defleshing and secondary deposition. 'If we suppose that stalactites were understood as equivalent to bones on a stone-like plane of existence, then cleaning bones and returning them to the stalactite-filled cave may have been understood as returning the bones to an eternal place where they came into being, the conclusion of a cycle of temporal incarnation. 'Conversely, the water that formed 'stone bones' in the cave (stalactites) and hence bones in the living may have been understood as spiritually powerful or nourishing.' Scaloria Cave stretches deep underground and is composed of at least two main chambers. It was completely sealed off until its discovery in 1931, when human remains, stone tools and broken pottery were discovered inside. The lowest section of the cave is only accessible though a narrow and steep passage that can only be crawled through. There Neolithic people placed pottery vessels where dripping water from the stalactites collected. Scaloria cave is a deep multi-caverned grotto in Tavoliere region of Puglie, in southeastern Italy, shown above . The delicate stalactites in the cave (left ) resemble bones as can be seen in the image on the right where a collection of bones recovered from the cave and stalactite fragments found among them on the cave floor . Archaeologists found more than 40 pots encrusted into the stalactites themselves. The upper chamber is more than 260 feet (80 metres) long and around 6 feet (2 metres) high. This area was occasionally inhabited and used to keep livestock but was also were farmers from the surrounding area placed their dead. In 1978 the fragmented remains of between 22 and 31 individuals were discovered in the chamber, around half of which were children. In one case one child aged between five and seven years old that dated to 5463-5221 BC had been buried complete but the skull had been later removed. An isolated adult skull was also found in a small stone niche in the cave. Dr Robb and his colleagues, which include Dr Ernestine Elster at University of California Los Angeles and researchers from the University of Rome and the Italian Institute of Experimental Archaeology, examined the bones, which have been lent to the University of Cambridge by the Archaeological National Museum in Manfredonia. The bones were found among pieces of broken pottery in the Scaloria cave during excavations in 1971 . They found no evidence of gnawing or damage caused by animals and few of the bones had been broken. However they did find that the bones were covered in small, barely visible cut marks made using flint or other stone tools. They found no heavy chop marks and instead it appears they had been cut using controlled, fine incisions. They said they found cut marks through out the skeletons they found, particularly around major joints or tendon attachments. Dr Robb and his colleagues conclude that the cutting technique was not aimed at removing major muscles in butchery. They wrote: 'Instead it seems to have been aimed at removing residual ... muscle tissue by working down the shaft and pulling or cleaning with the hands until some particularly tenacious bit required a few slices to free it. 'We have called this technique 'nick and strip'.' They added that the absence of violence and butchery suggests the flesh was not removed for cannibalism. Instead they believe the remains were brought from the farming settlements surrounding Scaloria where any remaining flesh was removed, the skeletons were dis-articulated and then strewn on the cave floor. They say some of the remains may have been previously buried before being brought to the cave. The ritual could have been similar to the Huron Feast of the Dead in North America, where the buried remains of dead relatives were dug up, cleaned and then reburied when the village moved location. Dr Robb and his colleagues said it appeared there may be a link between the pottery placed in the lower cave the ritual burials in the upper chamber. They said disposing of bones in this way may have marked an end to the mourning. Speaking to Mail Online, Dr Robb said: 'They had a remarkable variety of burial practices, which often created prolonged interactions with the dead. 'In this case, the paradoxical thing is that they seem to have cleaned the bones and then immediately disposed of them. 'It seems likely that producing clean bone was the end point of a longer ritual of mourning. 'Here at Scaloria people deposited both bones from elsewhere and whole bodies, and they seem to have cleaned the bones within less than a year after death, when some soft tissues were still on them. 'But it probably was an occasion for the community to come together and remember the dead.'

Article text: Stone Age farmers in Italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them, a new study has found. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in Puglia, south eastern Italy. These cuts and scrapes, made with stone tools, suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave. Many bones, such as this fibula, found in the Scaloria Cave showed fine cut marks made with stone tools . Archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process

Aleksandar Pantic was given his marching orders after just six minutes for the visitors, but this didn't stop Florin Adone from giving them a shock lead in the firs-half. Imanol Agierretxe equalised for Sociedad before the interval though and Chori Castro was able to make the most of the one-man advantage after the break to give the hosts a 2-1 lead. Inigo Lopez was then shown two yellow cards in quick succession, before substitute Alfred Finnbogason wrapped up the win with a late goal. Daniel Pinillos became the third Cordoba player to be sent off in injury time on a truly awful night for the club. More to follow later...

Nick Clegg today showed how his conversion into the comedy character has stepped up a gear with the unveiling of a bright yellow mobile radio studio almost identical to one used in the hit film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. The Lib Dem leader is to tour the country in an election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before May 7. He will hope to avoid the fate of Partridge in the 2013 movie, which saw the DJ accidentally shoot himself in the leg on Cromer pier. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg posed in the doorway of his yellow battlebus, echoing Steve Coogan's appearance as Alan Partridge at the premiere of the 2013 film Alpha Papa . The bright yellow Lib Dem battlebus will tour marginal seats across the country as Mr Clegg tries to prevent electoral wipeout on May 7 . Mr Clegg's bus bears a striking resemblance to the Radio Norwich mobile radio van used by Partridge . The Lib Dem vehicle has even been fitted with a radio studio to allow Mr Clegg to continue broadcasts. In the film Alpha Papa, Partridge is take hostage by DJ Pat Farrell and they continue their broadcast on the road . Mr Clegg is pinning his hopes of survival on wooing women in key parts of the country. The Lib Dems claim that a drop in undecided voters in selected marginal seats has coincided with a rise in support for their party. Today he appeared with his battlebus in Abingdon, part of a key marginal seat the Lib Dems are hoping to win back from the Conservatives. Party officials said that Mr Clegg's battlebus has been fitted with a satellite radio transmitter so that he can do interviews and radio phone-ins while he is on the road. Since January 2013, the Deputy PM has hosted Call Clegg on LBC, answering questions from listeners ranging from the political to the personal. Conversations about where he buys his underpants, wearing a onesie and  the price of diesel could have been lifted straight from a Partridge script. In the film Alpha Papa, Steve Coogan's character is taken hostage by sacked fellow DJ Pat Farrell and they continue their broadcast on the road using the bright yellow roadshow truck. Mr Clegg appeared with his battlebus in Abingdon, part of a key marginal seat the Lib Dems are hoping to win back from the Conservatives . Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge at the 'Alan  Partridge: Alpha Papa' world premiere in Leicester Square in July 2013 . Mr Clegg will hope to avoid the fate of Partridge in the 2013 movie, which saw the DJ accidentally shoot himself in the leg on Cromer pier . The Lib Dem vehicle is decorated with abstract images by two graphic design students and the slogans 'stronger economy, fairer society' and 'opportunity for everyone', in contrast with 2010's campaign bus which featured prominent photographs of Mr Clegg and Vince Cable. Addressing activists today Mr Clegg took aim at both the Tories and the Labour party, ahead of the election on May 7. He warned that leaving the European Union would be an act of economic 'self harm' and said it was 'stating the flaming obvious' that the UK needed to be at the heart of Europe. He said he was 'dismayed' by Ed Miliband's failure to spell out details of when he would balance the nation's books. Mr Clegg lent a helping hand to putting up election boards for local candidate Layla Moran . Mr Clegg said: 'Of course we have different views to the Conservatives. I'm the leader of the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron is the leader of the Conservatives. 'They have a completely different attitude towards Europe. They have this hokey cokey where one day they want to leave, the next day they don't want to leave. 'We are unambiguous as a party that says 'yes, Europe needs to be reformed, yes there needs to be a referendum when a decision needs to be made about the transfer of powers to the European Union, we guaranteed that in law'. 'We are not like the Conservative Party, half of whom are straining at the leash to leave. We think that would be a terrible thing for the British economy. 'But in the same way I strongly disagree with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls's failure to spell out when they would actually balance the books. I am dismayed the Labour Party want to borrow GBP70 billion more than we think is needed.' He added: 'Of course it would be an economic act of self harm to leave the European Union. 'Large parts of the Conservative Party and Ukip appear to want Britain to cut itself off from what is the world's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for British goods and services. 'For me it's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure Britain's presence at the heart of the European Union in the same way it's flaming obvious that we should secure the British economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts, which is the Conservative approach, nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing, which is Labour's approach.' Lib Dem strategists believe that winning over the female vote will be crucial to their chances of success across a range of key battleground constituencies. The Tories have often been accused of having a 'woman', with support much higher among male voters. The latest YouGov poll for the Sunday Times shows 33 per cent of men plan to back the Conservatives, compared to 31 per cent of women. For Labour it shows 35 per cent men, 36 per cent women. But for Lib Dems, just 6 per cent of men plan to vote for Mr Clegg's party, rising to 9 per cent among women. Mr Clegg warned it would be an 'economic act of self harm' if Britain were to leave the European Union . The Lib Dems point to internal polling which suggests women voters coming over to them in a series of must-win seats . They point to internal polling which suggests women voters coming over to them in a series of must-win seats. Their analysis of 18 marginals shows that the number of women who say they are undecided as to which way they will vote on May 7 has fallen from 30.6 per cent in 2014 to 22.6 per cent - a drop of 8 per cent. Over the same period they say that support for the Lib Dems in those seats has risen from 15.2% to 24.9 per cent - an increase of 9.7 per cent. They say younger women particularly are attracted by their policy on shared parental leave, while headline plans to prioritise mental health, raise tax thresholds and cut the deficit are popular among women generally.
