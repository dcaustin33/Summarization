All article text:The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage . Controversial Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will keep her job if the Tories win the election, the Prime Minister revealed yesterday. David Cameron said Mrs Morgan will be put in charge of plans to create 500 new free schools, which he claimed would drive up standards across the country. He said the schools – which can be set up by parents, faith groups or other organisations – were helping to wrest control of education out of the hands of 'pointy-heads in Whitehall'. He claimed the Tories are 'the only party that is opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children', adding: 'With me as Prime Minister and Nicky Morgan as Education Secretary, that's exactly what you're going to get.' Mrs Morgan is said to be 'delighted' to be the first Cabinet minister to be guaranteed her job if her party wins in May. But the move will alarm critics, who have accused her of watering down the radical approach to schools reform taken by her predecessor, Michael Gove. The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage, which she opposed before joining the Cabinet. But friends say she is only carrying out Downing Street's orders to mend fences with the teaching establishment, which Mr Gove derided as 'the Blob'. A Tory source said last night: 'The Prime Minister is a big fan of Nicky Morgan – he thinks she is doing a good job.' The Education Secretary confirmed that a future Tory government would not allow free schools to make a profit – an idea that was floated by Mr Gove but blocked by the Lib Dems. Free schools legislation allows groups to establish new state-funded schools which are independent of local authorities. As with academies, they do not have to teach the National Curriculum. Fewer than 300 have been opened to date, although 49 were given the green light yesterday. Labour has claimed it would not allow any more to open – and warned existing free schools could be placed under some form of local authority control. The move will alarm critics, who have accused her of watering down the radical approach to schools reform taken by her predecessor, Michael Gove (pictured) But Mr Cameron said a Tory-led government would open 500 new free schools after the election. Speaking at an academy in West London yesterday, he hailed the reforms as 'the most successful schools programme in recent British history'. He also insisted he is not trying to block controversial plans to allow a grammar school in Kent to expand by opening an 'annexe' in another town, saying: 'Grammar schools are good schools and I like good schools. 'Like other schools, if they are good, and want to expand, they should be able to.' Mrs Morgan is expected to take legal advice in the coming days on whether she can approve the expansion of the Weald of Kent Grammar School in Tonbridge, which wants to open a new site nine miles away in Sevenoaks.

All article text:Greek ministers have threatened to send ‘millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadis’ to Western Europe if it is forced out of the euro. The country’s defence and foreign ministers made the warning as eurozone creditors urge them to speed up promised reforms to receive payments on a £172billion bailout. Without the funding, the country – which shares a border with Turkey - will go bust, forcing it out of the EU’s single currency. Scroll down for video . Greek ministers threatened to send 'thousands of jihadis' to Western Europe as pressure mounts on them to speed up on promised reforms ahead of a bailout. Hundreds of extremists have left Europe via Turkey to join militants in Syria (a radical is pictured in Raqqa, above) Turkey has become the preferred transit route for European jihadists travelling to fight in the Middle East for extremist organisations such as Islamic State. Nikos Kotzias, the Greek foreign minister, told EU colleagues in a meeting last week that there would be far-reaching consequences in the event of a breakdown of order in his country. He said: ‘There will be tens of millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadists, if you take out Greece. ‘The Western Balkans is not stabilized. Then you have the Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, North Africa.’ In a similar warning, Panos Kammenos, the Greek defence minister, said that if the eurozone allowed Greece to go bust it would give EU travel papers to illegal immigrants crossing its borders or the thousands held in detention centres. Nikos Kotzias, the Greek foreign minister, said there would be far-reaching consequences in the event of a breakdown . He said: ‘If they deal a blow to Greece, then they should know the migrants will get papers to go to Berlin. ‘If Europe leaves us in the crisis, we will flood it with migrants, and it will be even worse for Berlin if in that wave of millions of economic migrants there will be some jihadists of the Islamic State too.’ Mr Kammenos, who is the leader of the Right-wing Independent Greeks party which is in coalition with Greece’s ruling Syriza government, said: ‘If they strike us, we will strike them. We will give to migrants from everywhere the documents they need to travel in the Schengen area, so that the human wave could go straight to Berlin.’ Most Greeks want the country to keep the euro, but two-thirds also continue to back the government’s tough stance to renegotiate the bailout package. Last month, Greece and its Eurozone creditors struck a deal to extend the Greek bailout to June. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister and leader of the Syriza movement, had to bow to German-led pressure to stick to the broad terms of its £176bn bailout in order to obtain the four month extension. The country’s creditors in the 19-country eurozone endorsed Greece’s request for the extension after the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund — the main institutions handling Greece’s loans — provisionally backed a list of reforms that Athens proposed.

All article text:She may be known for her gleaming, blonde locks, but Gwyneth Paltrow has made no secret of the fact she can’t style her own hair. Such is her love of a professional look, she invested in a chain of U.S. blow-dry bars last year. The first branch has just opened in London, offering seven Hollywood hairdos inspired by the actress, who is also the creative director — all at just £28 a throw. Scroll down for video . Sleek Volume: Fellow blonde Mandie Gower (pictured) made her way to Blo, in Covent Garden, to try out some of Gwynnie's signature looks . Blo, in Covent Garden, promises to bring Gwyneth’s signature looks to busy British women. The chain also has to satisfy her eco-credentials, so the salon does not use styling products that contain any chemical preservatives — called parabens — or sulphates. As a customer, all you have to do is point at the look you like best on the salon menu before you sit back for 45 minutes and sip a green tea as the stylist gets to work. Fellow blonde Mandie Gower went along to try four of Gwynnie’s most distinctive styles, and see if it really is possible to get Hollywood hair on the cheap. SLEEK VOLUME . Sleek Volume: Gwyneth rocked the 'sleek volume' at the 2005 Oscars (pictured) The style: The salon’s name for this look is the Red Carpet. Gwyneth rocked a similar look at the Oscars in 2005. And even the shampoo the stylist is rubbing into my hair has Hollywood connections. The salon uses a range called Unite by Beverly Hills celebrity hairdresser Andrew Dale and is free from paraben preservatives and sulphates. It turns out this is the first of many products that I need to be red carpet-ready. There’s a conditioner, then a mousse, followed by volumising spray. Then a slick of another Gwynnie favourite — argan oil. Once my pampered hair has been rough-dried, my Blo stylist Sundya divides it into small sections, rolling each one up into pin curls and securing them on my head with a grip. Another blast with the hairdryer and these are gently unrolled. Sundya then backcombs the roots before smoothing and separating the curls and fixing the whole look with a whoosh of hairspray. Verdict: My hair has more energy and bounce than Gwyneth after a pint of organic green juice. And it feels beautifully soft and natural rather than set and brittle. It’s me, but with added va-va voom. Result! 5/5 . TOUSLED TRESSES . The style: This just-got-out-of-bed look, called Pillow Talk, is easy to achieve when you have your own Beverly Hills celebrity stylist on speed dial. But if my pillows could talk, they would swear blind they’d never seen my hair looking like this first thing in the morning. Sundya reveals Gwyneth’s secret — a salt-water spray to give the hair that matt, slept-in look. Tousled Tresses: This just-got-out-of-bed look looks easy to achieve but is actually far from it, Blo stylist Sundya reveals salt-water spray is the secret to creating that slept-in look . Once she’s sprayed this on and blow-dried my hair using a medium round brush, she twizzles small sections into tight twists, and winds them individually around the barrel of a tong, holding them in place with her fingertips for about 15 seconds each. ‘This gives more of a wave than a curl,’ she says. She then gently brushes through the Medusa-like tendrils to create a more relaxed effect, before fixing it with hairspray. Verdict: I don’t look ‘sensual and innocent’, as promised on the salon menu. Even ‘messy beach waves’ doesn’t describe my hair at the end of 45 minutes. Far from looking like the sexy surfer girl I had imagined, I am reminded of a bowl of spiral pasta. 2/5 . AMAZING GRACE . The style: Gwyneth is no stranger to an up-do. Sundya says the key is ‘all about prepping the hair for a sleek finish’, and I soon discover this involves lots of products, from leave-in conditioner to a ‘Lazer Straight Relaxing Fluid’ which smoothes frizz. My hair is blown straight and pulled into a high ponytail. Amazing Grace: Gwyneth showed off a classic updo in 1996 film, Emma (left). Mandie (right) learnt that the key to this delicate look is preparing your hair for a 'sleek finish', which can involve a lot of products . To create the topknot — Gwynnie calls this look the High Society — the ponytail is divided into thick sections and tonged into a chunky curl to help coax a rounded bun shape out of my straight hair. As Sundya works her way round the ponytail, she carefully fans out each section, spreading and pinning it to create the bun. Verdict? Forget Gwyneth Paltrow. When I look in the mirror through the fog of hairspray, I swear I can see Grace Kelly. The menu ‘guarantees this coif will get you what you want’, and it’s true, my bun stays firm and perky all day, even winning a few compliments from strangers. 4/5 . BACKCOMB PONYTAIL . The style: Gwyneth rocked a beehive at a Louis Vuitton event a few years ago. But as I soon discover, this is a seriously high–maintenance look — not for nothing the salon calls it the Hunt Club — that takes a lot of backcombing. Backcomb Ponytail: Another favourite of Gwyneth's (left) is the beehive inspired ponytail. Mandie (right) discovered that this seriously high-maintenance look took a lot of backcombing . The vigorous brushing begins after my hair’s been washed and dried. And I panic at the sight of the matted bird’s nest on the top of my head. But minutes later Sundya has pinned it back and miraculously smoothed away the coarse texture with a brush, while keeping all the volume. The lower lengths (which weren’t backcombed) are swept into a side ponytail and fixed with a minimal band. Sundya then wraps a small section of hair around the band to cover it — the ultimate Gwynnie touch. Verdict: My ponytail looks a bit sparse compared with the enormous pouffe on top of my head. The menu suggests it is ‘a polished look for an impromptu polo match’. Sorry, but there are none of those going on where I live. 3/5 .

All article text:A volunteer middle school basketball coach has been charged with having inappropriate sexual contact with one of her 14-year-old players during a team sleepover, authorities said. Shakyla Wilson, 22, of Naperville, Illinois, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, according to DuPage County prosecutors. The abuse reportedly happened on February 20 at a player's residence after Wilson accompanied some of the girls from the Hill Middle School basketball team to a movie and spent the night at the sleepover, authorities said. Shakyla Wilson, 22, was charged with one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse after being accused of having inappropriate sexual contact with a Hill Middle School basketball team sleepover. She was a volunteer coach with the team . Wilson, also known as Kiki, began volunteering with the team in an unpaid, unofficial capacity at the end of January, Indian Prairie School District Superintendent Karen Sullivan said in a statement on the district's website. The district immediately notified police when officials became aware of allegations and told Wilson she could not be on school property, Sullivan said. She added: 'We want to stress that the district takes these charges very seriously. As this is now a matter for law enforcement officials to handle, we encourage anyone who may have pertinent information regarding this investigation to contact the Naperville Police Department. 'We are providing support in the school for any student who may need to discuss this issue. If your student wishes to talk with someone at school, please direct him or her to speak with their social worker or guidance counselor.' Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall told the Chicago Tribune that he was 'deeply disturbed' by the recent events. 'Ms Wilson purposely put herself in a position of influence and trust in order to prey on the innocence of young girls,' he said. State's Attorney Robert Berlin said that the allegations against Wilson are appalling. 'A coach's role is to motivate and inspire athletes to be the best they can be, both on the court and off it,' he told the Tribune. 'Coaches are there to help athletes attain their goals, not to take advantage of the trust their position holds just to satisfy their own sickening desires.' Wilson was an unpaid, unofficial volunteer girls basketball coach at Hill Middle School in Naperville, Illinois. She played basketball with the same team when she was in middle school . Though the district does not fingerprint volunteers at elementary or middle school levels, it does background checks through the Raptor system, which is used by 12,000 schools across the United States, according to the Tribune. The program screens a person's driver's license information to find registered sex offenders, Janet Buglio, director of communication services in the district said. 'Everyone entering our schools, including parents and volunteers, surrender their driver's license every time they enter a school to be used for a screening using the Raptor system,' she said. Wilson played basketball on two high schools state championship teams before joining the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee team for a year. She then transferred to St Joseph's College where she played basketball for two years. Before entering high school, she played basketball at Hill Middle School, the same place she was volunteering in January and February. Bail was set Friday at $100,000 and Wilson is due in court on March 24.

All article text:Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease . A grandmother claims she was left 'looking like Nanny McPhee' after 13 of her teeth fell out due to dodgy dental treatment. Alexandra Walkden, 62, was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease. Her grandchildren likened her appearance to the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. As a result, she was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. Now Mrs Walkden, a telesales worker from Preston, Lancashire, has won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave, 57. She said: 'I had to have surgery to remove 13 teeth and eventually have implants fitted. 'I looked like somebody who had been in a car crash. I had black eyes, swollen mouth and I couldn't eat for a week. It's ruined my life. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. 'My grandchildren would call my Nanny McPhee when I didn't have my dentures in because I had just one tooth at the top.' Mrs Walkden had been a patient of Dr Musgrave at the Preston-based Incisive Dental Practice for 30 years and attended dental appointments with him every six months. She said: 'During these years I didn't think anything was wrong. I'd get the all clear. 'Or I would say I was having problems and he would say he would have a poke around and say its fine and to see him in six months. 'If there were problems or a tooth was twinging, he would look at it or find a cavity and say it needs filling. I trusted him implicitly. Whatever he said, I believed. She added: 'As far as I know he did a routine check but he never told me I had gum disease. He never offered for me to see a hygienist.' The truth emerged during a holiday in 2013 with her partner when Mrs Walkden's crown fell out and she went to see a local dentist. To her horror, it emerged her teeth were rotting from the inside out. She said: 'When I went to see him the first thing he said was "when was the last time you went to the dentist?". 'When I said "3 months ago", he said "that's not what your teeth are telling me". 'I was completely shocked. We cut our holiday short and came home. 'I went to another dentist close to home and they confirmed I was going to lose all my top set of teeth.' 'You can't imagine the reaction when someone tell you they will have to take all your teeth out. It was horrible. 'They asked if I wanted to sit down.. It was a feeling that was absolutely horrendous. I had 13 teeth removed. 'I also had a wisdom tooth on the bottom removed that was beyond saving and had to have an implant to replace that wisdom tooth.' Despite paying for regular private dental treatment for 30 years, Mrs Walkden was horrified to be told by another dentist that her teeth were rotting from the inside out - and the top row would need to be removed . Her grandchildren likened her appearance to Nanny McPhee, the screen governess with magical powers played by Emma Thompson. Mrs Walkden, had to endure a number of deep cleaning treatments to treat the gum disease before all but four of her top set of teeth were removed. She said: 'I had to go through a few treatments of that. I have never experienced pain like that before as they clean beneath the gum line - it's very high powered. It was like torture but it had to be done. 'Then I went to have my teeth extracted, all but 4 at first. They fitted me there and then with a partial denture.' 'I had to get used to something so alien in my mouth and learn how to speak again as it changes the shape of your mouth. I didn't want to be left with dentures for the rest of time.' Mrs Walkden eventually underwent implant surgery in April 2013 and had to go to the dentist every week. She said: 'I have spent hours at the dentists and thousands of pounds and I have only been left with around £11,000 for pain and suffering. 'Compensation is not a "pay out". No amount of money can compensate for having lost my teeth. 'The money I've received will be used to cover the thousands of pounds I have paid out of my own pocket for all the necessary remedial and cosmetic work. 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now.' She added: 'This is all because this dentist didn't do proper checks. If he had done X-rays he would have known. It is basically negligence. 'I put the time in going to the dentists and I expected to be taken care of. If you look at the dentists records you see check-up after check-up every 6 months. You just don't expect to end up going through this.' 'I felt utterly betrayed by Dr Musgrave when I found out the extent of the damage to my teeth and gums. 'I've worked hard all my life to pay for extra things in life like private dental insurance and have never missed a dentist appointment. Mrs Walkden was forced to pay £24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants. She has now won £35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist, Dr John Musgrave . She said: 'If I weren't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought, I don't know what state my mouth would be in right now' 'I thought I was taking good care of my teeth and assumed that my dental insurer would have taken steps to screen its members. It was wrong to assume that my dentist's inclusion on the insurance register was a quality guarantee. 'It ruined my confidence. In that situation you just don't want to go anywhere - it's horrendous. It does nothing for your confidence and leaves you very self-conscious.' Associate solicitor, Heather Owen at the Dental Law Partnership which represented Mrs Walkden said: 'Alexandra's case was one of long-term mistreatment, compounded by a string of failures by her dentist Dr Musgrave. 'He routinely failed to check the health of her teeth, screen for gum disease, remove decay or even carry out appropriate preventative care. 'At no point was the patient advised of alternative treatment options or referred to specialists when her oral health started to decline.' Dr Musgrave, who did not admit liability, refused to comment.

All article text:Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara pointed the finger of blame at ref Craig Thomson after Paul Paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1-1 draw with Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Paton was astonished to be shown a red card along with Virgil van Dijk after the Dutchman and Calum Butcher clashed on the ground following a poor tackle by Celtic captain Scott Brown on Nadir Ciftci – who appeared to kick Brown’s head in retaliation. McNamara vowed to appeal in a bid to clear Paton for next Sunday’s League Cup final against Ronny Deila’s men at Hampden, and it remains to be seen whether SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan will take retrospective action against Butcher, Ciftci or Brown, with TV pictures indicating they could all have seen red. Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara wasn't impressed with referee Craig Thomson's performance . Paul Paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1-1 draw with Celtic . But the United boss claimed that, had the match official sent off Brown for the initial challenge, the ensuing melee and embarrassing card blunder would have been avoided. ‘I think we will be appealing,’ said McNamara, whose team were reduced to nine men in the second half when Paul Dixon was sent off for handling the ball in the box. ‘Paul Paton feels a bit hard done to for being sent off for nothing. He wasn’t even involved in the incident. But I think the ref should have dealt with the original bad challenge (from Brown) that sparked the whole thing off. But that went unnoticed. It was a two-footed challenge off the deck. It was a bad onebut it didn’t get dealt with properly. ‘We should be talking about the football rather than the ugly scenes. But, for me, the officials should have dealt with it first and we would not have had the problems we had today.’ Asked if he expects Brown to be hit with disciplinary action from the SFA, McNamara replied: ‘No comment.’ Ciftci scored United’s opener on the stroke of half time after Aiden Connolly appeared to go down easily in the box, with Celtic boss Deila later insisting the player should be punished for diving. Three minutes after the break, United’s Dixon was dismissed for blocking a goal-bound drive by Leigh Griffiths but the striker’s penalty was saved by keeper Radoslaw Cierzniak. Thomson ended up sending three players off, and United will appeal the red card of Paton . Griffiths had the last laugh, however, with a headed equaliser in the 71st minute to take the match to a replay at Parkhead on March 18. Ciftci was lucky to still be on the park after kicking out at Brown but McNamara claimed not to have seen the incident. ‘I need to see it. I haven’t looked back at the TV footage. And when Nadir gets tackled by Brown, the ball breaks and Butcher wins the challenge to put us through and I was looking at that next bit of play. I did not see what happened with van Dijk, Butcher or anyone else. I actually didn’t know the ref had got the wrong man until Paton came over and told me. It was a melee but the ref did not deal with the original bad challenge which sparked it all off.’ McNamara, whose side will now face Celtic four times in March, also defended young striker Connolly. ‘I don’t think he dived,’ he said. ‘I think he (Anthony Stokes) has caught him although he hasn’t caught him on the leg. It might have been soft but it was a penalty.’ McNamara had no complaints about the spot-kick award and red card when Dixon handled a shot by Griffiths. ‘Rules are rules but Rado made a great save. He didn’t deserve to lose a goal today. But we switched off for one moment and Griffiths peels off and scores a header. ‘We can take certain things from today’s game but Celtic will be saying the same. Cool heads will be needed for the final next week. The disciplinary side needs to be better. ‘It’s a chance for silverware and for the lads to create a bit of history. Will I be sick of the sight of Celtic by the end of our four games this month? Not if we beat them.’

Nicknamed 'al-Britani Afro' because of his hairstyle, rapper Raphael Hostey, 22, has allegedly been instrumental in luring Britons to become fighters or jihadi brides in Syria. The news came as a shock to his neighbours, who remembered him as an innocent-looking 12-year-old boy obsessed with Manchester United. Menacing: A masked Raphael Hostey, 22, brandishes AK47s in a photo on Twitter while wearing a floppy hat . Fresh faced: Hostey was remembered by his neighbours in Moss Side, Manchester, as an innocent boy . Just a few years later he would shun his British upbringing and leave his wife and child to join IS. Posting raps about jihad on Twitter, he has urged young women considering joining IS to 'come as soon as possible'. Hostey's identity was revealed by an alleged Syrian double agent arrested in Turkey, who was involved in recruiting the three teenage girls from east London who flew to Syria last month. Hostey left behind a wife and child to travel to the country in 2013 with two friends, Mohammed Javeed and Khalil Raoufi, both 20. All three were students at Liverpool John Moores University. Javeed and Raoufi are thought to have died in fighting. Hostey, from Moss Side in Manchester, is known among jihadis for his afro hairdo. Under the name Abu Qaqa, he is thought to have used social media to lure many more British recruits to IS, including jihadi brides. In raps posted on Twitter, he has urged video game-loving followers to stop playing 'Call of Duty and Fifa' and come 'to the khalifa' (or head of a Muslim state). He also posed wearing a floppy fisherman's hat with his face covered and assault rifles on each shoulder. Commander: Under the name Abu Qaqa, he is thought to have used social media to lure  British recruits to IS . Football fan: Hostey was remembered as a 12-year-old boy who was obsessed by Manchester United . Since travelling to Syria, he is believed to have risen to the rank of senior commander. Hostey was injured in fighting but has not come home and still brags of his exploits on social media sites. On Tumblr he told 'a sister in London' to contact him privately when she asked for advice on life under IS. Born Raphel Saiho Hostey, he preferred to be known by the more anglicised name Raphael. Yesterday, neighbours said he 'loved playing football with other local lads'. They also revealed his family home was raided by police in September, with officers searching it for days. Siful Khan, 27, who lived opposite the red-brick semi for 15 years, said he was 'shocked' to hear about Hostey's alleged activities, adding: 'He used to wear a Manchester United shirt. He loved them.'

All article text:The Church of England yesterday published a prayer for the General Election that called on its congregations to vote for ‘policies that sustain the poor’. In a move likely to plunge its relations with Tory leaders to a new low, the Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’. In the wake of controversial election advice put out by CofE bishops earlier this year that urged support for the European Union, the prayer also asked churchgoers to ‘work for unity and co-operation throughout the world’.the Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’. The Church issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest’ It was published in a ‘study guide’ to the ‘pastoral letter’ on the election produced by bishops in February. The letter was taken by Tories as a campaign against the market economy, consumerism and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher. The new study guide from the Church’s Mission and Public Affairs Division underlined the call for consideration of ‘relationships among the nations of Europe who share a long history moulded by the Christian faith’. It repeated demands for ‘a fresh debate’ on nuclear weapons, and said those who care about tackling debt should also care ‘about the burdens borne by the most vulnerable in society’. Two prayers were offered: in one worshippers were asked to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest and to support policies that sustain the poor, the vulnerable and the frightened people of this world’. A second prayer calls for protection ‘from the sins of despair and cynicism’ and ‘the idols of false utopias’. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘It is truly bizarre that they are praying to sustain people in poverty. Surely the aim should be to support people to lift themselves out of poverty? Which is exactly what we have been doing through our welfare reforms: giving everyone who is able to work the skills and the opportunities to do so.’ Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: ‘The Church of England needs to be very clear that it is not endorsing the Labour Party, whose language this slightly mirrors.’ Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Tory defence minister, said: ‘The Church of England needs to be very clear that it is not endorsing the Labour Party, whose language this slightly mirrors’

In the region, where clusters of hundreds of galaxies are colliding, a rich variety of objects are visible only to radio telescopes. Scientists created a ‘true colour’ image of the region to reveal what it would look like if humans could see radio waves, rather than just visible light. Researchers have released an amazing image of Abell 2566. In the annotated image (move the slider to see the markings), the point sources (examples in red) are galaxies like ours. Blue objects are radio galaxies with streams of plasma, and in green is the 'Large Relic', which could be a shockwave as the clusters collide. Researchers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) made the image using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico. In the image, red colouration shows longer radio waves, moving down to blue, which is composed of shorter radio waves. The region is known as Abell 2256, and is about 800 million light-years from Earth and about four million light-years across. The image covers an area in the sky almost as large as the full moon. In the image, the multiple ‘dots’ that can be seen are ‘normal, everyday galaxies’ as big as the Milky Way, Dr Jean Eilek of the NRAO told MailOnline. A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous at radio wavelengths. It is usually composed of two jets being expelled from a large elliptical galaxy. Radio galaxies can be detected at large distances, which makes then useful tools in studying the structure of the universe. ‘Star formation in such galaxies is a strong source of radio waves, which come from supernova remnants and cosmic rays that are energised in the star formation regions.’ There is also a handful of objects known as radio galaxies, which each have a massive central black hole that emits jets of plasma. ‘In clusters like this the unusual shapes of the radio galaxies are due to the interaction of those jets with the cluster atmosphere,’ Dr Eilek continued. ‘We don't yet understand just why each of those sources have the shapes they have - we’re still working on that. ‘But these are definitely radio galaxies in the cluster; we think the merger happening in the cluster has something to do with the large number and unusual shapes of these radio galaxies.’ Resarchers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) made the image using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, shown here. The VLA is at an altitude of 6970ft (2125 metres) and consists of 27 independent antennae . Two of these, towards the right-hand side of the image, have long trails with them. This may be due to them speeding very fast through the cluster, with their plasma left behind in a tail. Perhaps the most notable part of the image is, as Dr Eilek calls it, the ‘big fuzzy thing’ to the upper right. This is known as the Large Relic, and it is a million light-years across but its formation is a mystery. ‘One possibility is that this is a huge shockwave, caused when the two clusters ram together supersonically,’ said Dr Eilek. However, she notes that it could also be a ‘reconnection layer’, where magnetic fields are pushed together until they annihilate. This same process is thought to drive solar flares in our sun, and also Earth’s aurorae.

All article text:For desperate Chinese families whose children suffer from debilitating brain conditions such as cerebral palsy, there is only one place to go. Those who have little or no money to pay for treatment flock to a ramshackle village in Changsha, one of China's fastest-growing cities, which has sprung up in the shadow of a specialist hospital. The community has become known as the 'brain paralysis village', as families from around the country set up home there in the hope of receiving crucial treatment than can improve the quality of life for their children, according to a report on People's Daily. Father and daughters: Village resident Zhu Dongwen (middle) and his twin daughters, who were born in 2011 . Hundreds have moved there - spending upwards of ¥100 (£10.6) per month on rent - because the treatment at the nearby Xiangya Bo'ai Rehabilitation Hospital is completely free, as it is funded by a government scheme. Roughly 10 kilometres from the Changsha Railway Station, the village has formed spontaneously, as desperate families arrive to seek medical advice from the largest rehabilitation hospital in central China. The free service is only open to parents who have run out of money and no longer have any other way of getting help for children who suffer from serious brain problems. Zhu Dongwen, 43, is one of the many parents living in this village. Both of his twin daughters, born in 2011, suffer from brain paralysis. 'I never found out what that really meant, or why it happened, although I spent all my savings looking for an answer and looking for a cure,' said Mr Zhu. 'In the end we were turned out on the street and in desperation in April last year I managed to get taken in here. I had almost run out of hope, but the community gave me back my hope.' Mr Zhu came to the village with ¥1,000 (£106) in his pocket in April 2013. Although the treatment is free-of-charge, the families still need money to live off. Now a full-time carer for daughters Zhu Sihui and Zhu Siying (not their real names) without any stable income, Mr Zhu is spending around ¥3,000 (£318) to support the family's life in the village. He took out a loan of more than ¥250,000 (£26,422) from various sources, which was spent on seeking care for his daughters, according to another report onChina Daily. Road to recovery: Both of Mr Zhu's daughters are recovering slowly. In the picture, Mr Zhu is dressing his  Zhu Siying while Zhu Sihui is warming up her hands near the fire . Inside hospital: Mother Wang Qun is helping her daughter Xiang Liping with rehabilitation . Under the intense treatment being carried out at the centre, the first of his daughters recovered enough control over her body to be able to walk. A month later his second daughter followed suit, and now they are able to interact with him and carry out many tasks that would have been impossible a year ago. Mr Zhu said: 'I am finally starting to believe that my girls will now be able to live relatively normal lives and even if something should happen to me they will be able to look after themselves one day. It is an impossible dream come true and all thanks to the chance I had to come here.' The project is unique to the area and it is not clear where the funding comes from, but children get rooms and care on-site. And with his daughters' care in hand, Zhu Dongwen is even able to do some work locally to start to save again and build a future for them all outside of the village once they are well enough to leave. He said: 'I have hope again and it is this place that has given us that hope.' Treatment in demand: A governmental report suggested that there are around 20,000 children with some form of 'brain paralysis' in Hunan Province in southern China . The village: Housing around 100 families, the neighbourhood is located close to a major hospital offering a scheme which gives free treatment to children with brain paralysis. According to People's Daily, the scheme plans to help 9,000 such children under seven years old in Hunan. All of the children are classified as critical when they arrive, and most of them are unable to do anything for themselves. A government report suggested there are around 20,000 children in Hunan Province who are diagnosed with some form of 'brain paralysis', but only a small portion of them can afford to be treated properly.

All article text:A four-year-old girl has been found distraught and dehydrated after she was left inside a hot school bus for several hours in Victoria's west. A statement on behalf of the driver from Bus Association Victoria  says the service collected the girl from her home however upon dropping her to kindergarten the driver 'couldn't locate the child.' He says he then parked at the bus depot and performed a routine check of the vehicle before leaving at approximately 9am. The four-year-old should have been dropped to Warracknabeal Memorial Kindergarten on Tuesday morning . The girl's parents only learnt of her absence upon arriving at the school to collect her at about 1:30pm Tuesday afternoon. Unable to find their daughter they contacted the bus company and the police. The driver was contacted by the bus company and was the first to the scene. He says he found the child in the bus 'in good spirits and well'. 'This is a terribly unfortunately circumstance. The child may have been asleep under the seat - but we're unsure,' says the statement. The bus driver alleges a parent of the child physically assaulted him at the depot causing him to be visibly shaken. The police confirmed they attended an incident at Warracknabeal bus depot where two men were involved in a 'scuffle'. Police were called to the scene however the investigation is ongoing and no charges have been laid. Warracknabeal was 'lucky' to be experiencing mild weather on Tuesday unlike the hot day that claimed the life of a 22-month-old child in February . Yarriambiack Shire Council chief executive Ray Campling told the ABC it's lucky the girl got out unscathed however if it was much hotter she may have been seriously hurt. Noah Krespanis was found unconscious and was unable to be revived . 'The little girl either fell asleep at the back or just slipped down between the seats and unfortunately she was left in the bus for a few hours,' he said. 'It's a sad case, but if anything it's a reasonable outcome for what could have been a drastic outcome.' This comes less than two weeks from when a 22-month-old boy was found dead after being left inside a hot car at Kyneton, just north of Melbourne. Noah Krespanis was found in a car parked outside a home on Acacia Drive in Kyneton in 31 degree heat. The car window was smashed in order to rescue Noah but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. It's been reported that temperatures would have reached up to 60 degrees inside the car on the hot Summer day. Public Transport Victoria are investigating the bus provider Annascott Pty Ltd who is contracted to provide the Willenbrina to Warrackanbeal service. The operator says they consider this a very serious matter and will co-operate fully with the authorities. Ambulance Victoria were called in to help at least six young children locked in hot cars in separate incidents during February, and a total of 200 children in the first five weeks of 2015 .

All article text:(CNN)All you need is luck, to misquote one of Liverpool's most famous exports, The Beatles. But Liverpool's footballers won't mind one bit that a fortunate goal sealed a vital win at Swansea to set up a pivotal clash with Manchester United at the weekend. One of English soccer's biggest rivalries is renewed on Sunday with vital points at stake in the race for a place in next season's European Champions League. Jordan Henderson knew little about his winner in Wales, the ball flying in after Jordi Amat's clearance struck him, but it helped make it seven wins out of eight for the Reds. A sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home pulled it within two points of Manchester United in fourth, with just four points separating Liverpool from Manchester City in second. "It's a great result," Henderson told Sky Sports. "The first half was disappointing but I felt as though we did better in second half, passed the ball and created a few chances. "It was a great pass by Daniel, I got a little fortunate with the finish but you've got to be in the right position to score. "Overall we're delighted with three points and we now look forward to Sunday. We can't wait for it, we are high on confidence and have great momentum but United played well the other day. "It'll be a tough one but at Anfield we go in confident and hopefully we'll get the result we need." In a lackluster start, Daniel Sturridge dragged a shot wide of post for Liverpool before England international Adam Lallana fired a fierce half-volley right at Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. From then on Swansea asserted control. Martin Skrtel had to be alert to clear as Swansea's French striker Bafetimbi Gomis -- starting for the first time since collapsing on the pitch at Tottenham earlier this month -- headed at goal. Gomis then played a neat one-two with Wayne Routledge before forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet into a fine low save. Next to threaten Liverpool's net was Iceland international Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose effort was arrowing for the top corner before Mignolet intervened. Just before halftime Jonjo Shelvey, a former Liverpool player, went close with a shot from a right wing corner that was deflected wide by Alberto Moreno. But having had a chance to regroup, Liverpool came out galvanized after the break and were soon on the front foot. First Fabianski made a brilliant save to keep out Philippe Coutinho's near post effort before the Pole was then in action again to deny Joe Allen. Though Liverpool were in the ascendency, its opening goal was down to a stroke of luck. As Henderson galloped onto a through ball Swansea's Spanish defender Amat got there first, but his clearance ricocheted off the Liverpool player and into the net past Fabianski. From then on Liverpool did a fine job of squeezing the life out of the game and playing on the counter, striker Daniel Sturridge hitting the post late on as Swansea left gaps at the back. Reading seal Wembley berth . In the FA Cup -- England's premier cup competition -- second tier Reading sealed a trip to Wembley to face Arsenal in the final four after beating Bradford 3-0. Goals from Hal Robson-Kanu and Garath McCleary inside nine minutes punished third tier Bradford, before Jamie Mackie added a third in the closing stages. Reading will face Arsenal in April while the other semifinal sees Aston Villa play either Liverpool or Blackburn, who meet in a replay.

All article text:Seven-year-old Faith Lennox never thought she needed a left hand; after all, she couldn't remember losing hers when she was only 9 months old. The 7-year-old,  grabbed the replacement as soon as it came off a 3-D printer on Tuesday in Los Alamitos, California. She put it on and raced off on her bicycle. Later, Faith happily showed off the hand to others, flexing its pink and blue fingers as she gripped her small, stuffed 'Finding Nemo' fish. The prosthetic was constructed overnight at the Build It Workspace studio. It represents a breakthrough in small, lightweight hands that are economical and easy for children to use. Scroll down for video . She doesn't need any help: Faith Lennox, 7, right, smiles as she holds an extra plastic prosthetics part with her newly 3-D printed hand at the Build it Workspace in Los Alamitos, California on Tuesday . A new addition: Faith Lennox, 7, adjusts her newly 3-D printed hand which is the result of an emerging technology that is revolutionizing prosthetics . But when it came to getting one custom made in a day by a 3-D printer, that was a different story. Particularly when she got to pick the colors — her favorite pink, blue and purple, like the ones on the tank top she was wearing. It didn't hurt, either, that the appendage, called a robohand, looks a lot like the pair Marvel superhero Iron Man wears. 'It's really cool!' the otherwise shy little girl said with an exuberant grin as she stood surrounded by high-tech computers in the Build It Workspace in this Orange County suburb on Monday. Build It Workspace is a 3-D printer studio that teaches people to use high-tech printers and provides access to them for projects. It also does commercial printing. She had gotten out of school early to go there with her mother, Nicole, to watch in fascination as her new hand began to take shape. She stood for several minutes transfixed as it slowly moved from computer image to hard-plastic reality. The finished product will be the result of an emerging technology that is revolutionizing prosthetics, said Build It's Mark Lengsfeld, especially for children like Faith, who quickly outgrow expensive prosthetic limbs and have trouble even using them because of their size and weight. Many functions: Faith Lennox, 7, rides her bicycle with her newly 3D printed hand outside the Build it Workspace parking lot  on Tuesday . Cool tricks: Greg Lennox holds a 'Nemo' plastic fish as his daughter Faith grabs it with her newly 3-D printed hand as her mother, Nicole and Build it Workspace president, Mark Lengsfeld, looks on . 'It's an amazing thing to be doing,' the company's president and founder said of making a hand that weighs less than a pound out of the same kind of plastic used in automobile parts. Although Lengsfeld's company has printed out everything from pumps for oil and gas companies to parts for unmanned aerial vehicles, this is the first hand he and his three employees have built. Airwolf 3D, whose printers built Faith's hand, recently cranked out 200 hands for children around the world as part of an international competition to see which company could use the most 3-D printers in one space at one time. Airwolf, with 159 printers going, won by one, said the company's creative director, Tyler Caros, who was keeping watch on Monday as the hard plastic going into Faith's hand slowly unspooled. In love with her hand: Faith Lennox, 7, left, forms a heart with her newly 3D printed hand on Tuesday . Going for a ride: Faith Lennox, 7, adjusts her helmet before riding her bicycle with her newly 3D printed hand outside Build it Workspace in Los Alamitos, California . The oldest of three children, Faith had compartment syndrome when her position during childbirth cut off the flow of blood to her left forearm, irreparably damaging tissue, muscle and bone. After nine months of trying to save the limb, doctors determined they had to amputate just below the elbow. Faith's parents were working with the nonprofit group E-Nable to get her a 3-D-printed hand, but the technology is so new there's a waiting list, her mother said. Then she learned of what Lengsfeld's company could do from a friend whose son visited with his Scout troop. E-Nable provides open-source technology for building the hand, Lengsfeld said, making it economical for anyone with the right printer and a set of instructions to create one. Faith's only costs $50, and when she outgrows it she can easily build a bigger replacement. 'It's been an honor to help her,' he said. The little girl who taught herself to swim at age 3 and surfs with her father already knows what she plans to do when she puts that new hand on. 'Ride my bike!'she said with a big grin. Although she's already a competent rider, she noted that making turns with just one hand can be a little tricky. Family fun: Faith Lennox, 7, left, shows her mother Nicole her newly 3-D printed hand on Tuesday .

All article text:Is your libido flagging? If so, then a lack of sleep may be the reason why, researchers claim. A study has found a direct relationship between how much sleep a person gets and their level of desire the next day. The amount of shut-eye also affects how aroused they will become. The study, involving 171 women, showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent. Poor sex drive? Getting more sleep is directly linked with an increase in libido, new research has shown . Sleep was also important for genital arousal, according to the research, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. Specifically, women who slept longer experienced fewer problems with vaginal arousal than those who obtained less sleep. 'The influence of sleep on sexual desire and arousal has received little attention in the field,' said Dr David Kalmbach, of the University of Michigan. 'But these findings indicate that insufficient sleep can decrease sexual desire and arousal for women. He added: 'I think the take-home message should not be that more sleep is better, but that it is important to allow ourselves to obtain the sleep that our mind and body needs.' And it's not just women - previous research found men with poor sleep patterns have significantly lower levels of testosterone, which results in a lack of sex drive. Experts say that reduced levels of the hormone can bring a host of other negative consequences for young men, including reduced libido and poor reproduction. They can fail to build enough strength through muscle mass and bone density, leading to low energy levels, poor concentration and fatigue. Low testosterone levels are also linked to the metabolic syndrome - a cluster of metabolic risk factors that increase the chances of developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Scientists from the University of Chicago found men who get less than five hours sleep a night for a week or longer suffer have far less levels of testosterone than those who get a good night's rest. The study showed that each additional hour of sleep increased the likelihood of sexual activity with a partner by 14 per cent - and increased levels of arousal . Their study found that the levels of the hormone are reduced dramatically to levels more akin to someone 15 years older. 'Low testosterone levels are associated with reduced wellbeing and vigour, which may also occur as a consequence of sleep loss,' said Professor Eve Van Cauter, who led the study. Other reasons for low libido include poor diet, being overweight and low iron levels. An estimated one in four British women doesn’t get enough iron from their diet, and iron deficiency is known to leave your libido lagging, says Dr Radha Modgil, a GP in West London with a special interest in sexual health. ‘Low iron levels are thought to reduce the quality of blood flow and so sap energy,’ she explains. ‘If you’re exhausted, sex is obviously the last thing you feel like doing.’ ‘The best source of easily absorbable iron is a nice juicy steak,’ adds dietitian Helen Bond. ‘Red meat like steak helps release key amino acids from the brain which are important for good mood.’ Other reasons for low libido include poor diet, being overweight and low iron levels. Dietitians say red meat such as steak is a good, easy-absorbed form of iron . ‘Red meat is also a good source of B vitamins, which help convert the carbohydrates we eat into energy. It’s also a rich source of zinc, important for the production of the sex hormone testosterone, which women also need for sexual desire. Other good sources of zinc include beans, nuts and oysters.’ Eating too much white bread and other refined carbohydrates can sap your sex drive, says Helen Bond. ‘Foods such as white bread release the sugar more quickly than their wholegrain counterparts — and too much sugar is associated with energy slumps, which mean you won’t have the energy for sex,’ she adds. Too much sugar also makes you fat, raising the level of oestrogen in the body, in turn reducing testosterone levels in men, says gynaecologist Peter Bowen-Simpkins, . ‘If you’re obese, you feel less attractive. You also have reduced blood flow to the sex organs.’

All article text:Facebook is to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, with users able to put on a VR headset and explore a virtual location. The social network announced that users will be able to view videos filmed with multiple cameras, and move the viewpoint in order to explore a location. The innovation is being showcased at the firm's F8 developers' conference in San Francisco under the name Teleportation Station - a name that was leaked via an app notification this morning. Scroll down to see a 360 degree video . Facebook is hosting two-day developers' conference F8, where Mrk Zuckerberg revealed its VR plans . The company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week's F8 conference by showing off a 24-camera-view of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. On a desktop computer, it is controlled by a mouse. 'You're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset,' Zuckerberg said, 'and view spherical videos there too.' The  videos are shot with twenty-four cameras working in parallel. 'You can move around inside the video,' Mark Zuckerberg said, 'and view it from different angles.' The company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week's F8 conference by showing off a 24-camera-view of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. On a desktop computer, it is controlled by a mouse. However,  the company describes its spherical videos as a 'first step' toward even more immersive videos that we'll view through virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift, which straps over your eyes and provide the illusion of stepping inside a digital environment. 'You're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset,' Zuckerberg said, 'and view spherical videos there too.' He also announced that users will soon be able to share content from third-party apps in their Messenger - Facebook's instant messaging service. 'One of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is Messenger,' said Mr Zuckerberg. 'Facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things, now Facebook is a family of apps,' he said. 'Moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we've made in our strategy in helping connect people.' The Messenger Platform was also launched, allowing developers to build new services into the app, which is used by 600 million users each month. Mr Zuckerberg said it would give users 'more tools for expression'. The new Platform will give users the chance to communicate directly with businesses, for example to change an order as well as track its delivery. The move will allow users to see 360 degree videos using the Oculus Rift headset (pictured) Facebook's David Marcus, vice president of messaging products, took to the stage to confirm that apps like ESPN have already built apps that will now be supported in Messenger. Over 40 apps will be launched in the coming days, he confirmed. The initial kit for developers to build their software into Messenger will be available from today, though no general release date has yet been confirmed. Mr Marcus also spoke of Facebook's desire to revolutionise online shopping by allowing users to receive real-time shopping updates via Messenger. This will start a message thread with the brand a user has shopped with, so they can track and alter an order via an instant message conversation. Users can then send a thumbs-up to confirm an order. It will begin rolling out in the 'next few weeks', according to Mr Marcus. 'It's time for us to reinvent how people and business communicate,' he said. Ilya Sukhar, from the social media site's Parse department, the area of Facebook made for developers, also announced that the social network will begin supporting software development kits (SDKs) for the 'internet of things'. This is the idea that all a person's smart devices can be connected together, enabling developers to create apps for Facebook that can control part of the home. Facebook is trying to mould its Messenger app into a more versatile communications channel as smartphones create new ways for people to connect with friends and businesses beyond the walls of the company's ubiquitous social network. To pull it off, Facebook is opening Messenger so outside programmers can build features tailored for the service. Messenger will also be adding the ability to display store receipts and shipping information to help consumers keep track of their interactions with merchants and other businesses. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted the Messenger expansion Wednesday during his opening speech at a two-day conference for developers in San Francisco. The push to plant more features in Messenger underscores the growing importance of apps that enable more intimate and direct conversations than social networks. The example of receiving a notification when a garage door is opened was demonstrated on-stage. The F8 developers' conference, which is being attended by more than 3,000 Facebook app developers, is the social network's only major live show of the year. The company, which has more than 1.3 billion monthly users, also unveiled a range of new tools for advertisers, including new analytics tools to monitor ad campaigns. 'All of you are the ones building the services that are unleashing this new wave of expression,' said Mr Zuckerberg, as he returned to the stage. 'It's really our honour to serve you and to be on this journey together. Let's go connect the world,' he said.

All article text:The small foam pieces used to protect fragile goods in boxes could soon power your phone thanks to a battery breakthrough. Researchers have developed a way of turning the so-called 'packing peanuts' into carbon, which can then be added to the types of lithium batteries used in everyday gadgets. During tests the packing peanut-based batteries could store 15 per cent more power than current technology - and they even outperformed similar batteries made of graphite. Scroll down for video . Researchers have developed a way of turning  so-called 'packing peanuts' (pictured) into carbon, which can then be added to the kinds of lithium batteries in everyday gadgets. During tests the packing peanut-based batteries could store around 15% more power than current technology . This breakthrough was made by Dr Vilas Pol, Dr Vinodkumar Etacheri and their colleagues at Purdue University. They presented their findings at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600°C (1,100°F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. These sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mAh per gram. By comparison, an iPhone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mAh and weighs 0.9oz (28 grams), while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mAh/g. This means the packing peanut technology could make batteries smaller and lighter, yet more powerful. Typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200°C (4,100°F), meaning Dr Pol's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly. Dr Pol got the idea to turn these peanuts into nanoparticles and microsheets when he was taking delivery of new equipment for his lab. 'I looked at the packing peanuts and thought that while we are exploring "green" technologies, we should not be harming the environment by throwing them away,' he said. The researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600°C (1,100°F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries. These sheets had a lithium-ion storage capacity of 420 mAh per gram. By comparison, an iPhone 6 battery has a total storage capacity of 1810mAh and weighs 0.9oz (28 grams), while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mAh/g.

Typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200°C (4,100°F), meaning Dr Pol's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly. The researchers at Purdue University began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600°C (1,100°F) to create blocks of black carbon. These blocks were then flattened into microsheets (pictured) and nanoparticles, which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries . Drs Pol and Etacheri then tested the microsheets and nanoparticles as anodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The lithium ions move between the electrodes during charging and discharging and the researchers said their anode works so well 'it outperforms commercial [anodes], with a storage capacity higher than graphite, a typical anode material.' And although the higher temperatures used to create other sheets create a more layered arrangement of carbon atoms to maximise  performance, Dr Pol's less-ordered materials are said to have a 15 per cent higher electrical storage capacity. Typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200°C (4,100°F), which creates more structured sheets. By comparison, the 'disordered crystal structure' of Purdue University's sheets (shown) lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit - making them more powerful . Dr Pol hopes his group's new, scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries (pictured) within two years . '[The batteries] have disordered, porous structures,' said Dr Etacheri. 'The disordered crystal structure lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit, and their porous microstructure lets the lithium ions quickly diffuse into the microsheets and creates more surface area for electrochemical interactions.' Dr Pol hopes his group's new, scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries within two years.

All article text:A man died after he dived into the path of a Tube train to try to save his younger brother who had jumped on to the tracks. Nick Mann, 35, was killed as he attempted to rescue Robert, 32, who is believed to have dropped his mobile or wallet on to the line at Old Street station in London. He tried to pull his brother to safety but suffered severe head injuries when a Northern line train ploughed into them both. Siblings: Nick Mann (left), 35, died after he was hit by a Northern line train at Old Street station in the early hours of Sunday - while trying to save his brother Robert Mann (right) who had jumped onto the tracks. The pair were taken to the Royal London Hospital where Nick, a writer from Wimbledon, died. Robert, who lives in Manchester, was yesterday in a stable but critical condition. Hours before the tragedy – just after midnight on Saturday night – Nick took a selfie with his brother at Fratton Park in Portsmouth where they had gone to watch their favourite football team Shrewsbury play the home team. Friends yesterday paid tribute to former Manchester University student Nick, who they said ‘would have done anything for anyone’. One friend, who did not want to be named, told the Evening Standard: ‘The fact that Nick passed away while saving his brother is the least surprising thing in all of this. Emergency services: The scene outside Old Street station in central London after the incident  on Sunday . Ambulance on the scene: Police  said that on arrival officers discovered two men with serious injuries . ‘He had all the time in the world for anyone, and gave so much to everything he had passion for. He loved two things in equal measure – music and football. He was one of the most passionate people I’ve ever known. He was a great dude.’ Josh Retallick, who had known Nick for eight years, said: ‘It was such a heroic act. I just hope his brother recovers.’ Eyewitnesses said the pair were hit by a train as Nick – who ran a rock music fanzine – desperately tried to pull his younger brother, who studied history at Manchester Metropolitan University, on to the platform. A Tube worker said: ‘The man dropped something down on to the track, a mobile phone or something, and then somehow he’s got into trouble down there. ‘This other person then tried to help him out and pull him up back on to the platform in time before the train came, but it wasn’t in time and they both got hit. It was pretty bad.’ Another said: ‘It happened at the back of the platform, just as the train pulls in, so maybe they didn’t realise how close the train was.’ British Transport Police described the incident as a ‘tragic accident’. Location: Both men were hit at Old Street station (under this roundabout), and Nick Mann died in hospital . Hit: One Tube worker said a man had been spotted dropping something onto the track on CCTV (file picture)
