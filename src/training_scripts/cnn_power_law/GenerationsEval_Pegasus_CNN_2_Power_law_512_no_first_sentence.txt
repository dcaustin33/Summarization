All article text:The family of black teenager Tony Robinson, who was shot and killed by a white police officer on Friday, have demanded justice in the wake of his tragic death, while court documents have revealed the health problems he was experiencing. A report by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections suggests the 19-year-old was an impulsive risk-taker who had ADD and experienced anxiety and depression. It stated the teenager also faced a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster after being exposed to a 'chaotic' family situation. The revelations were announced as close to 2,000 students marched in Wisconsin's capital to protest the fatal police shooting, while the police chief apologized. Students crowded into the rotunda of the state Capitol in the morning, chanting, waving signs and demanding justice. Scroll down for videos . Demanding justice: Demonstrators protest the shooting of Tony Robinson at the state Capitol in Wisconsin on Monday. The 19-year-old was gunned down by a white police officer in Madison on Friday . Symbolic: Students held up signs saying 'Hands Up, Don't Shoot' and raised their hands into the air as they stood on the rotunda of the building . Deadly incident: Robinson, 19, was shot by officer Matt Kenny at an apartment in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday evening. The teenager's family have demanded that a full investigation be launched into his death . Madison police officer Matt Kenny shot Robinson on Friday evening while investigating a call that the young man was jumping in and out of traffic and had assaulted someone. Turin Carter, Robinson's uncle, said his family was calling for a thorough investigation and was concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males,' but did not endorse blanket anti-police sentiments. 'We are not proponents of anti-police (attitudes)... We understand that law enforcement is necessary and mandatory and we need to change our mindset about the police,' Carter said at a news conference outside the house where Robinson was shot. Standing near a memorial of candles and balloons, Carter said it was simplistic to call Robinson African American, saying he had a mixed heritage and his racial ambiguity was a central issue in his life. Many teenagers at the morning protests were from Robinson's alma mater, Sun Prairie High School. 'There is an indifference between people and police. We all need to come together,' said Ali Asafford, 15, after leaving class at Madison's East High School. The march was orderly and police presence was minimal. Plea: Turin Carter, Tony Robinson's uncle, tells the media there should be a thorough investigation into his nephew's death and is concerned about the 'systematic targeting of young black males, . Issues: Court documents revealed that Robinson suffered from mental health problems - such as anxiety and depression - and had a choice between a middle-class lifestyle and that of a gangster . Powerful image: Angelica Alv holds up a sign which reads 'Our Lives Matter' while using paint to signify blood . Gesture: Demonstrators raise their fists in unison inside the government building. Earlier on Monday the Madison police chief apologized for the deadly shooting . Officer Matt Kenny, the 12-year police veteran who shot Robinson, is on paid administrative leave while the Wisconsin Department of Justice investigates the shooting. In 2007, Kenny was involved in a fatal shooting that was found to be justified. Police Chief Michael Koval apologized on Monday after praying with Robinson's grandmother over the weekend and pledging transparency in the investigation. 'Reconciliation cannot begin without my stating 'I am sorry,' and I don't think I can say this enough. I am sorry. I hope that, with time, Tony's family and friends can search their hearts to render some measure of forgiveness,' Koval wrote in his blog. Attorney General Brad Schimel asked the public to be patient with the investigation, saying his office would not be able to disclose details since it could taint testimony from witnesses. Gathering: Madison Mayor Paul Soglin addresses a crowd of protestors on Martin Luther King Boulevard. Around 2,000 students descended on the city to protest the teenager's death on Monday . March: Demonstrators make their way down East Washington Avenue, approaching the State Capitol\ . Official efforts to be transparent, apologetic and light-handed with protesters followed months of heightened attention to police use of deadly force across the United States. Last year, the police shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, set off weeks of protests that sometimes turned violent. Police reaction was criticized as heavy-handed, and critics were outraged at the long delay in releasing the name of the officer who shot Brown. Madison, a city of 240,000 people about 80 miles (130 km) west of Milwaukee, has a mostly white population. The city is 7 percent African-American, U.S. Census figures show. Last year, Robinson pleaded guilty to armed robbery, and was placed on probation. Sentencing documents show it was his first brush with the law, and he was not the armed person in the group that committed the robbery. Heartfelt note: Most of the protesters who had walked out of their classrooms. One had scrawled a message on a lamppost . The robbery case file includes a letter from Robinson's grandmother, Sharon Irwin, to the judge. In it, she asks for her grandson to be sentenced to probation, saying he was just following his co-defendants' lead. Robinson 'is a great kid in between being a teen and a man,' she wrote. 'That is one of his issues. Impulsive. The other is being a follower.' His aunt, Loren Carter, wrote a note to the judge asking for mercy in sentencing. She said Robinson grew up poor without his father but was kind-hearted and intelligent. Robinson's defense attorney, Michael J. Short, wrote to the judge that Robinson had taken special-education classes and had never been in trouble with the law before. Studensts and some adults stood arm-in-arm as they made their way down the streets . 'He was an easy choice for the seasoned co-defendants to manipulate into participation,' Short wrote. 'He did not give any orders but just followed the instructions meted out by the other defendants.' Keith Wessel, a Madison family law attorney who said he was married to Robinson's grandmother for a time, wrote to Short in September and told him that he raised two of Robinson's uncles and knew Robinson from birth. Wessel wrote that some branches of Robinson's family exposed him to a 'chaotic environment.' He did not elaborate but said Robinson faced a choice between a middle-class life and the 'gangsta' path. He warned if Robinson went to prison on a felony charge he would continue toward the gangster world. He said Monday he was shocked at the shooting. He said Robinson stood 6-foot-5 but was a 'teddy bear.' Remembrance: A memorial for the teenager was set up outside the apartment where he was shot. It has gradually built up with flowers and tributes . Laid down: Flowers, balloons and candles line the road near the location where officer Matt Kenny gunned down Robinson on Friday . Emotional: Destiny Marshall of Atlanta, Georgia, is consoled by friends during a protest . 'I can't imagine Tony is going to fight a cop breaking into his house,' Wessel said. 'I just don't see that as likely ... I really think we need to examine our police policies.' Concern about Wisconsin's own history of police use of deadly force prompted passage of a law last year requiring independent investigators to probe such incidents. The bill had support from police associations. The head of the local NAACP chapter said the Madison police department did not engage in the sort of racial targeting that the U.S. Justice Department found prevalent in Ferguson. 'I have observed what I think is a very effective community policing structure, and I think it makes a difference,' said Greg Jones, president of the Dane County chapter of the advocacy group.

Mali's desert north, where French forces wrested control of territory from separatist rebels and al Qaeda-linked fighters, is plagued by frequent political violence - but this is the first militant attack for years in Bamako, in the south. Three Malians were also killed in the violence, which began about 1am, in and around La Terrasse restaurant, which is popular with expatriates. Police carry out their investigations at the scene of the militant attack in Mali's capital . Soldiers gesture in front of the La Terrasse restaurant where five people were killed . Blood stains on the floor of the restaurant show where the group were killed . A group of soldiers controlling the crime scene perimeter carry gear into the zone . An armed soldier stands guard after French and Belgium nationals were killed in the attack . It also left nine people injured and authorities said two people have been arrested. Senior police officer Falaye Kanta said: 'There were two individuals who were armed and hooded. 'One burst into the La Terrasse restaurant and opened fire on people. Then he got into a vehicle in which the other was waiting. 'As they fled down a neighbouring street, they shot a Belgian man who was in front of his house. 'He's dead. Not far away they came across a police vehicle and threw a grenade, killing the driver.' Those killed included a girl who died in hospital, Kanta said. Witnesses said police secured the street where the restaurant shooting took place because of unexploded grenades. Two international experts with the United Nations Mine Action Service were among the wounded, according to initial reports, said Mongi Hamdi, U.N. special envoy for the peacekeeping mission to Mali (MINUSMA). French forces took control of northern Mali two years ago but insurgents continue to mount attacks. France has more than 3,000 soldiers in West Africa as part of a counter-insurgency force against al Qaeda-linked militants. Mali's government signed a preliminary peace proposal on Sunday meant to end fighting with northern separatists, but the Tuareg-led rebels demanded more time before agreeing to any accord. Police said they arrested two men who they believe carried out the attack . Those killed included a girl who died in hospital, police said . Two international experts with the United Nations Mine Action Service were among the wounded . France and Belgium condemned the attack at La Terrasse restaurant and bar in Bamako and their foreign ministers confirmed the deaths of their nationals. European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said one of the victims of the Bamako attack was a Belgian security officer with the EU delegation in the capital. 'This terrorist act strengthens even more our resolve to help fight terrorism throughout the region,' she said. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders denounced a 'cowardly act of terror' and France's Laurent Fabius said 'everything must be done to find those responsible for this crime.' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed a French citizen was among those killed and said the attack strengthened France's resolve to 'fight terrorism in all its forms'. The French embassy in Mali said on Saturday it had alerted its citizens and beefed up security.

Kam Brock, from Long Island, has filed a suit at Manhattan Federal Court saying she was wrongly told she had bipolar disorder and was forced to endure eight days at the mental facility at Harlem Hospital. The Jamaican-born 32-year-old also says that doctors didn't believe her when she told them that the President followed her on Twitter, even though her account, @AkilahBrock, shows he does. Ms Brock's Twitter account, under the handle @AkilahBrock, which shows Barack Obama is indeed one of her Twitter followers . According to the New York Daily News, a treatment plan for Ms Brock at the hospital states: 'Objective: Patient will verbalize the importance of education for employment and state that Obama is not following her on Twitter.' Ms Brock, an Astoria Bank worker, ended up in the psychiatric ward last September when the NYPD seized her BMW car as they suspected she had been smoking marijuana. A day later she went to an NYPD station to retrieve her car, and claims police put her in handcuffs and in an ambulance after she became 'emotional'. She told the Daily News: 'Next thing you known, the police held onto me, the doctor stuck me with a needle and I was knocked out.' The president, pictured, currently follows more than 640,000 different accounts on the social media website . According to her lawyer Michael Lamsoff, she was forced to endure injections and group therapy for eight days before she was finally allowed to go home. Both the NYPD and Harlem Hospital have declined to comment on the case. President Obama was one of the first politicians to harness the power of Twitter and currently follows more than 640,000 different accounts. These include both celebrities and ordinary people. In 2012, a picture posted of him hugging his wife Michelle after winning a second term in office, with the caption 'four more years', became the most retweeted post of all time.

All article text:(CNN)Gov. Mike Pence unleashed a firestorm on Indiana last week when he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Critics of the law contend it could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate -- particularly against the LGBT community of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals -- on the basis of religion. The ramifications for the Hoosier State are just starting to be felt in the form of boycotts, petitions and travel bans. As the controversy mushrooms, here's what got us to where we are. And where things are headed. Last week, Pence put his signature on the RFRA -- a law that allows Indiana businesses to cite their religious freedom as a legal defense. The law states that the government can't "substantially burden a person's exercise of religion" and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be "substantially burdened" can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Pence says the RFRA "ensures that Indiana law will respect religious freedom and apply the highest level of scrutiny to any state or local governmental action that infringes on people's religious liberty." Pence notes that there is no reference to sexual orientation in the law. Civil liberties and gay rights groups hold to their stance that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief. "Silence is consent!" tweets Laurel Davilia, a commentator on Brass Knuckles Progressives Radio. From sports teams to musicians to other cities and states, they fell like dominoes. The NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis and set to host its men's basketball Final Four in the city this week, said the law could lead it to move events elsewhere in future years. The NBA, WNBA and NFL issued critical statements too. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay says fans of all stripes are welcome. "The Colts have always embraced inclusiveness, tolerance, and a diverse fan base," Irsay tweets.  "We welcome ALL fans to Colts Nation.   ONE FAMILY!" A petition posted on change.org hopes to get the Big Ten Conference to move its football championship out of Indianapolis. "I think that Indiana needs to be told that it must respect all persons regardless of sex, age, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation," Sean Burke of Madison, Wisconsin, says in the petition.  "As a football fan, I think we can send a message by calling on the NCAA and Big Ten Conference to take a stand." Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis is scheduled to host the league's championship game through the 2021 season. At last check, the petition had more than 11,000 supporters. The mayors of San Francisco and Seattle have barred spending on travel to Indiana.  The governors of Connecticut and Washington state did the same thing. And you can add Wilco to the boycott bandwagon. The group is canceling its May 7 show in Indianapolis, it says on Facebook. "The 'Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act' feels like thinly disguised legal discrimination to us," Wilco says.  "Hope to get back to the Hoosier State someday soon, when this odious measure is repealed." Cher is among the artists speaking out.  Her son Chaz Bono is a transgender man. "#GOVPENCE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF RIGHT WING RACISM, ASAULT ON WOMANS RIGHTS & HATRED OF LGBT AMERICANS," she tweets. Indiana's top two state lawmakers pledged Monday to amend the state's controversial "religious freedom" law to clarify that it cannot be used to discriminate against gay people. "This law does not discriminate, and it will not be allowed to do so," David Long, the Indiana Senate president pro tem, said during a news conference with state House Speaker Brian Bosma. Pence had said earlier that he was working with lawmakers to clarify the law. Critics still weren't on board with the anti-discrimination claims.  Opponents of RFRA marched around the state capitol. Someone even created a satire ad:  "Indiana. It's a great place to be a bigot.". The rhetoric has reached such a fever pitch that a front page editorial in Tuesday's edition of the Indianapolis Star blares the headline:  "Fix.  This.  Now." The editorial suggests the RFRA and protections for gays and lesbians can co-exist. The state is at a crossroads it says. "(N)o matter its original intent (the law) already has done enormous harm to our state and potentially our economic future," according to the editorial.  "Only bold action -- action that sends an unmistakable message to the world that our state will not tolerate discrimination against any of its citizens -- will be enough to reverse the damage." The editorial closes with: . "Governor, Indiana is in a state of crisis. It is worse than you seem to understand. "You must act with courage and wisdom. You must lead us forward now. You must ensure that all Hoosiers have strong protections against discrimination. "The laws can co-exist. And so can we." Some of the GOP's top figures are backing Pence despite the controversy.  Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have voiced their support.  Both are considered likely Republican candidates for the White House. Sen. Ted Cruz, who announced his candidacy last week, is also on board. "I'm proud to stand with Gov. @mike_pence for religious liberty, and I urge Americans to do the same," Cruz tweets. Indiana is the 20th state to adopt a "religious freedom restoration" law, most of which are modeled after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993. But that law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition and wasn't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years. Adam Talbot, a spokesman with the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, stresses that those 20 laws are "dramatically different in their scope and effect." "Calling them similar in this way risks being misleading. Indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country," Talbot says. Arkansas' legislature passed an Indiana-style law on Friday, which now heads to the state's governor for approval. Despite the controversy, the Indiana governor says concerns that his state's new "religious freedom" law will allow businesses to turn away LGBT customers is the result of a "tremendous amount of misinformation and misunderstanding." Still, he was hard pressed to explain why that wasn't the case. Given a chance on Sunday to add some clarity, Pence refused to answer at least six yes-or-no questions from ABC's George Stephanopoulos about whether the measure legalizes discrimination against gays and lesbians. Jeremy Diamond and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.

After the Milibands’ two-kitchens saga, last night the BBC took us to David Cameron’s constituency kitchen in Oxfordshire in the latest example of ‘Hello’ television political coverage. It was there that the PM announced that he might not look for a third term in Downing Street. Er, might be worth waiting until you’ve won a second one before you start talking about a third, comrade.

Whatever, the BBC’s James Landale was shown chopping vegetables with the PM as lunch was prepared for the Cameron family. The slinky Samantha, looking as though she was just out of some foam-scented bath, wandered towards the cooking area in a loose-fitting lumberjack shirt and announced that her husband was ‘definitely the best man for the job’. She added that ‘me and the family’ (did they not teach grammar at her public school?) kept him grounded. Kept him in the kitchen chopping carrots, more like. But what a healthy lot the Cams are. Did you see those lettuce leaves in the colander? No wonder he has lost weight, poor man. Can a man really run a country on rabbit food? This latest up-close-and-gooey film with a party leader – which came after the Miliband domestic epic disaster, and a little-noticed shocker with Nick Clegg and his parents – started with Mr Cameron on the touchline at a children’s football game in his Witney constituency. His son Elwen, aged nine, was playing. ‘Come on, Chads! Great save!’ bawled the PM, making sure the camera crew had a good view of him. Mr Cameron said that he felt ‘fit enough’ for another term of the premiership, and would be gutted if he lost the election. It was country casuals time. The aesthetic was one of Boden clothes and gummies and Chelsea tractors in Oxfordshire lanes. In the kitchen it was Belfast sinks and nourishing stews. Then came a moment from the Carry On films, surely. We followed Mr Cameron on a visit to his butcher. Chicken was on the shopping list. Past: David Cameron invited the cameras into his kitchen in Oxfordshire in 2006 - and commenters said that it now looks a lot more cluttered . Labour leader Ed Miliband previously allowed the cameras into his 'second kitchen' - an area for snack-making in his north London home . Mr Cameron: ‘I like the thighs because they’re very juicy.’ Ooh, missus. Kenneth Williams or Frankie Howerd could not have delivered it better. The butcher did not seem entirely keen to take part in the political promo’. Reporter Landale enquired if ‘David’ was the shop’s most famous customer. No answer from the man with the sharp knife and bloody apron (borrowed from the PM after his last reshuffle?). But Mr Cameron announced that one Jeremy Clarkson sometimes visited the butcher. So now we know where Clarkson gets his old beefs. Talking of the Top Gear presenter, Mr Cameron disclosed that his daughter Nancy, 11, had threatened that very morning to go on a hunger strike if Clarkson was dropped by the BBC. Oops. Tricky moment for Landale and his editors. But to their credit they kept it in. Mr Cameron said he had told Nancy that this was ‘not exactly Gandhi’ (a reference to the emaciated Indian Mahatma who used to fast in protest at British imperialism). Later we learned that Nancy had tucked into a hearty lunch, so her hunger strike had ‘lasted five minutes’, said her father. Longer than some election promises, darling. Kitchens update: Not to be outdone, ITV earlier in the day gave us an interview from the sparse wee scullery of gnasher-toothed Scots Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon. It looked about as warm and inviting as the sea off Aberdeen.

All article text:Stuart Lancaster has urged Twickenham to will England to victory on Saturday evening as he prepares to order his RBS 6 Nations title hopefuls to carry the game to France. Lancaster believes the noisy support of a sold-out 82,000 home crowd will have a critical role to play in edging rivals Ireland and Wales for Championship glory on a nerve-jangling final day of staggered kick-offs. England are favourites to lift a first piece of silverware under Lancaster and their head coach refuses to view the match through the prism of the looming World Cup on these shores. England scrum half Ben Youngs fires out a pass as Courtney Lawes and Joe Marler (left) watch on . 'It will be hugely important that the crowd get behind the team,' Lancaster said. 'If there's ever a day when we need the crowd to push us over the line and give us the momentum we need then it's Saturday. 'Whether we just need to get the win or win by 10 points or whatever it might take, the crowd will have a huge part to play. 'This game is not about the World Cup, it's about winning the Championship. And that's all it's about. It's about Saturday night only. 'Our mindset is to go and win the game. We can't play just to hang in there. We have to have a front foot mentality and have an intensity and tempo to our game from the first minute.' England fly half George Ford winds up a pass in training at his side's team base at Pennyhill Park . England head coach Start Lancaster has backed his side to handle the pressure of their final day shoot-out . England enter the final round of matches with a points cushion of plus four and having digested earlier results from Wales' trip to Italy and Ireland's visit to Edinburgh, their victory target against France will be made clear. The scheduling appears to have favoured England, but Lancaster insists providing the climax to the tournament creates its own challenges. 'I don't think we can be seen as favourites. I don't think anyone can. It will play out on the day,' Lancaster said. 'Whether the staggered kick-offs help us depends on what the other scores are. 'If we have to win by 20, psychologically if you concede seven points in the first five minutes and then a penalty, you then have to score 30. 'Psychologically it's an interesting dynamic for the players to manage. The danger is that sometimes you can want to chase the game too early rather than build the score. 'It's an 80-minute game. Knowing that is one thing, but dealing with everything that's around it puts incredible pressure on the players. The England squad gather for a huddle at the end of their training session as Lancaster looks on from afar . Former France No 8 Imanol Harinordoquy insists all the pressure will be on England on Saturday . 'On the staggered kick-off times, we all know the rules when we start. It makes it exciting.' Lancaster has made one change to the starting XV, promoting lock Geoff Parling at the expense of Dave Attwood, who drops out of the 23 altogether, with Nick Easter recalled to the bench. Attwood has started all four matches of the tournament but misses out on the final instalment with Lancaster believing the street-wise Easter is a better option to reinforce the final push for silverware. 'When you boil it down, it's the experience that Geoff brings. He didn't go on the Lions tour by accident, he's a high quality player,' Lancaster said. 'Dave is a very good player who has lots of qualities, but Nick will make a stronger impact from the bench and that's why the decision was made. 'Dave understood the decision. There were performance reasons as well. It wasn't just done because of Geoff. There are areas of Dave's game we've been asking him to improve on. 'It was a difficult conversation but ultimately done on a performance point of view. Dave accepted it and knows the areas he has to work on.' England have finished runners=up for the last three years running with points difference alone deciding the 2013 and 2014 tournaments. When asked if he was fed up at finishing second, Lancaster said: 'Yes! It would be nice to win this time.'

All article text:In five weeks time Las Vegas will pay host to the biggest boxing match in history when Floyd Mayweatehr Jnr and Manny Pacquiao roll into town for their $300million mega fight. It is an evening Amir Khan desperately wanted to be involved in after repeatedly calling for Mayweather to take him up on his challenge to dethrone the undefeated American. It hasn't kept the Bolton-born boxer away from the bright lights of Vegas, however, as he was pictured at 1 Oak Nightclub in the Mirage Hotel and Casino on Friday night. Amir Khan poses with TV personality Scott Disick during night out in Las Vegas . Khan's wife Faryal Makhdoom uploaded this picture montage from the night out at 1 Oak Nightclub . Khan uploaded a picture taken from his taxi as he drove to his hotel in Las Vegas . Khan posed for pictures during the night out with his wife and television personality and star of American show Keeping Up With the Kardashians Scott Disick. Khan, who has yet to agree his next opponent after missing out on securing a bout with Mayweather, believes the American will emerge victorious against Pacquiao on May 2. Khan told Sky Sports News: 'It's going to be a great fight and I think five years ago it would have been ever better because they were both at their peak and it was a fight that everyone was dying to see. Khan trains in the gym as speculation continues over who his next opponent will be . Khan hits Devon Alexander during their welterweight bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena last year . 'Since then Manny Pacquiao has had two defeats. He’s been knocked out once by (Juan Manuel) Marquez and then he got beat by (Timothy) Bradley which was a little controversial, but I think Mayweather will take the fight. 'He will be much smarter and he’ll pick his shots a little bit better. He’ll make it a little boring at times because Manny, as we know, is a come-forward fighter who likes to do a lot of punches. 'But Mayweather will try to avoid all those punches and just maybe throw that one shot that will count and then move away again. But time will tell. 'I’ve been watching Mayweather train on social media and he has been training very hard so he might come up with a different gameplan this fight, something that we have not seen before.

The 23-year-old asked on Twitter: ‘If Arsenal win 2-0 they go through?’ No, afraid not, Emmanuel. Arsenal officially had 1,200 fans in the Stade Louis II — but an estimated 5,000 were in the 18,000 crowd with Monaco having put the tickets on general sale. Despite their renaissance, the Principality, with a population of 38,000, unsurprisingly struggles to fill the stadium, even on big European nights. Five thousand Arsenal supporters packed in to the Stade Louis II for their tie against Monaco on Tuesday . It perhaps should come as no surprise that a tax haven inhabited by the super rich should lack passion — but it was difficult to avoid the comparison with the ferocious atmosphere of Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon Stadium, the other venue hosting a Champions League fixture on Tuesday night. Monaco’s Stade Louis II stadium had all the intensity of a yacht club soiree. This was Arsene Wenger’s first win as a manager against Monaco. He had previously drawn four and lost three. Despite Bono, Larry Mullen and the Edge all of U2 fame, watching the game from the stands, Wenger and his side still couldn’t find what they were looking for in Europe .

Taken at the Atmen refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey last December, the image shows the young girl frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed. The child has been identified as Adi Hudea, whose father died in the 2012 Hama massacre and who has been living with her traumatised mother and three siblings at Camp Atmen ever since. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: Taken at the Atmen refugee camp on Syria's border with Turkey, the image shows four-year-old Adi Hudea frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed . Shocking: Palestine-based photojournalist Nadia Abu Shaban tweeted the image along with the caption: 'Thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up' The image was taken by Turkish photojournalist Osman Sagirli but went viral earlier this week when it was shared on social media. Palestine-based photojournalist Nadia Abu Shaban tweeted the image along with the caption: 'Thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up'. Turkish media researching the origins of the photograph later suggested Adi Hudea was a four-year-old boy, not a girl, and revealed he was a resident of the Atmen refugee in Syria. But BBC Trending have subsequently spoken to Sagirli himself who confirmed the image shows a little girl. Ms Shaban's tweet has since been reposted more than 14,000 times and prompted emotional responses from social media users. One wrote: 'I'm actually weeping seeing this. We've made this planet a horrible place, haven't we?', as another said: 'We are failing the younger generations and those still to come. SHAME ON US.' Horrified: The image has  prompted emotional responses from social media users, especially on Twitter . One Twitter user wrote: 'I'm actually weeping seeing this.

Terror: A man walks with his children past the site of a Syrian government barrel bomb attack in Aleppo's Dahret Awwad neighbourhood . The five-year-old Syrian Civil War has so far claimed more than 220,000 lives, including an estimated 10,000 children. Millions of people have been displaced by the conflict, with more than 12 million people - including five million children - still in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. The image emerged as the Syrian government announced plans to import 150,000 tonnes of wheat for its starving population - just weeks after saying it had no need to do so. Despite millions of Syrians fleeing the fighting to neighbouring countries, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is grappling with ensuring there is enough grain for all. Trade sources say Damascus faced challenges importing sufficient stocks as payment problems and fighting have deterred many international firms from trading. Terrorists: Militants from the Islamic State (pictured) have seized control of vast swathes of northern Syria, subjecting millions of people to their brutal oppression . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has also been accused of numerous atrocities as he desperately tries to cling to his . Ruined: An apartment block in the city of Aleppo is seen destroyed following five years of conflict in Syria. The Civil War has so far claimed more than 220,000 lives, including an estimated 10,000 children . Before the war, Syria kept annual strategic stocks of around 3 million tonnes of wheat. The state-run General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob) has declined to give a figure for how much is left but said it is seeking 150,000 tonnes of wheat in an import tender that will close on April 13. The announcement came three weeks after the minister of internal trade and consumer protection Hassan Safiya said an improved wheat harvest in 2015 would translate into self-sufficiency. 'We need to import to bolster our strategic stocks and have started with this tender to test the market,' a Hoboob source told Reuters. Hoboob said the government was currently relying on its 2014 local harvest and drawing on its strategic reserves to keep its bread subsidy programme going.

Milstein's Cruise Ships series gives a bird's-eye view of the huge floating holiday vessels. The New York-based photographer uses high-resolution camera equipment to capture views from a helicopter with an open door. They include the Disney Dream, which features a nine-hole mini-golf course, 11 nightclubs and lounges and the first 'water roller coaster': a 765-foot long winding waterslide called the AquaDuck that goes through the ship's funnel. Scroll down for video . The Royal Caribbean Majesty of the Seas and Freedom of the Seas are photographed from above by Milstein in a helicopter . And this is how the majestic cruise ships look from the side as they force their way through the sea, the Majesty of the Seas on the left, and the Freedom of the Seas on the right . Milstein also shot the fourth largest cruise ship in the world in the form of the Royal Caribbean Freedom of the Seas. The $800 million vessel can accommodate 3,634 passengers and 1,300 crew on 15 passenger decks. Mr Milstein said: 'Giant cruise ships, over three football fields long, have become unique floating cities. Photographed symmetrically from directly above in very high resolution, the large gallery prints, up to 74 inches, show the viewer a detailed view not commonly seen. 'The ships can be seen with their passengers lounging on deck chairs, playing on water park slides, putting greens, running tracks, and basketball courts. They have a curious beauty and tell us something about how we as a culture form instant communities for shared recreation and relaxation. The Disney Dream cruise ship is radiant in the sea with a nice clash of lighting, while right, The Carnival Victory can cater for 2,754 people and is an awesome sight at night . Disney Dream looks somewhat different when viewed from land, showing its height and the navy and red livery, and right, The Carnival Victory is an imposing sight . The Caribbean Princess has a giant poolside movie theatre that will impress, while right, The Carnival Victory has fine dining throughout . The modern Caribbean Princess ship offers all the comforts of home and more, with space for 3,082 guests and all of the signature features . 'The ships which continue to be built larger and larger are fascinating to ponder as engineering marvels. Seen as a typology, they share a common symmetry derived from function, yet juxtapose design elements both decorative and functional that set them apart. 'This ongoing series which began in 2013, is related to the Aircraft series which I have been shooting for over 15 years. I take most of these photos using an 80 mpxl digital medium format camera with a gyro stabilizer, shooting from a helicopter with the door off.' The large highly detailed gallery prints will be on exhibit at Benrubi Gallery in Manhattan, from July 9 until August 22. The Carnival Sensation has three waterslides, and makes two trips a day to the Bahamas from the US; pictured right is the Norwegian Sky Cruise Ship has 13 dining rooms and 12 bars .

Todd Hall died March 8 in Athens where he had been getting treatment for the last several years, according to the Lawrence County Prosecutor's Office. A cause of death for the 43-year-old couldn't be immediately confirmed Monday. Suspect: Todd Hall, center, miles before leaving court in Ironton, Ohio (2002 file photo).  Hall was accused of starting a 1996 fire at an Ohio fireworks store that killed nine people . Hall, of Proctorville, was 24 when prosecutors say that, as a prank, he threw a lighted cigarette on a shelf crammed with fireworks at the Ohio River Fireworks store in Scottown, about 100 miles southeast of Cincinnati. The blaze on July 3, 1996, killed nine people and eleven people were injured. Five of the victims were from Ohio; the four others were from nearby West Virginia. According to court testimony, Hall had part of his brain removed after suffering a serious injury in a 1987 skateboard accident and had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old . The Daily Independent reported that victims included 24-year-old Ryan Aldridge; 3-year-old Shelbi Cron; 21-year-old Misti Cron, 31-year-old Candy Lee, 14-year-old Matt Sansom, 8-year-old Ona Tolliver, 34-year-old Floyd Tolliver, 9-year-old Jason Wallace, and 71-year-old Kathlene Wilks. According to court testimony, Hall had part of his brain removed after suffering a serious injury in a 1987 skateboard accident and had the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. Charged with aggravated arson and nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, he repeatedly was ruled incompetent to stand trial in the years since then. In recent years, he had shown severe impairments in his ability to control his behavior, regulate his mood and take care of himself and was deemed incapable of living outside a facility, according to the last court-ordered evaluation a few years ago. The Daily Independent reported that Hall giggled and sang the Star-Spangled Banner in court. Authorities initially thought three friends challenged Hall to set the fire, but they all passed polygraph tests and were never charged. About 40 people were in the store at the time and ran for the exits when fireworks started going off.

The Hull City manager responded to Hughes’ anger at the incident by insisting Ireland should already have been sent off following ‘the worst challenge on the pitch’ on David Meyler at the Britannia Stadium. A picture of Ireland’s bloody leg was revealed in the aftermath of the match but Bruce said: ‘I could show you a picture of Figueroa's ankle, he had five stitches in it and carried on.’ Ireland (left) sustained a deep gash on his leg after a challenge from Hull's Maynor Figueroa . Referee Neil Swarbrick did not give a free kick for the challenge that left Ireland with a gash in his leg . The challenge left a  wound on Ireland's leg that Stoke boss Mark Hughes said  needed 12 to 15 stitches . That has angered Hughes, his former Manchester United team-mate. ‘Steve has fallen into the trap of trying to defend the indefensible,’ said Hughes. ‘Everyone has seen the two challenges and I don't think there is any sort of comparison whatsoever. ‘The outcome is there for everyone to see so I don't think Steve did himself too much credit with his observation. ‘It's fairly easily to defend things - and I do it too - but on this occasion it was not as if the lad would be suspended. So why did Steve not just say, “It was a terrible tackle”? 'We're trying to move on but Steve did not need to do that. He did not need to say that. To defend that is incorrect.’ Stoke boss Mark Hughes has accused Hull City counterpart Steve Bruce of trying to 'defend the indefensible' Hull boss Bruce queried why Stephen Ireland was on the pitch after his challenge on David Meyler . Hughes added: ‘It looks likely Stephen is unavailable for two to three weeks. ‘Most people now have seen the picture and he’s had internal stitches as well as external, so it takes a little bit longer than a straightforward gash. ‘I’m disappointed as he was doing really well, filling the gap for Bojan.’

He took a job at the Daily Telegraph and soon after became a photographer for The Age, which sent him touring with the Australian cricket team. Slippery dip, Gundegal, New South Wales, 2007 . Limestone Coast,South Australia, 2007 . However, when Parke's landlord called saying he needed his house back, Parke took it as a sign. He and his wife, photographer Narelle Autio, picked up their two boys and set off on the journey of a lifetime, taking seven years to embark on a path of discovering, which cumulated in The Black Rose exhibition. The items in the exhibition, his largest ever, have been hand-picked from more than 7,000 reels of film, 15,000 words scribbled in diaries, and 14 published books. Fever, Dash,Adelaide, 2014 . Parke used his camera like therapy on his trip and he admits it got him through the tough experience of losing a parent. The Black Rose symbolises his long journey, his mother's funeral and the fact that she is not alive any more. While on his way around Australia, Parke came across a black rose and took a cutting of it, planting it in his garden so he and his father and brothers can use it as place where they can remember their mum.

'The only thing I remember was that she was an amateur photographer who used to send photographs into the local newspaper as part of their $5 reward page,' he said. 'The mind works in amazing ways when you're confronted with such pain at such a young age. 'You just don't want to go there and you don't want to think about it and I've continued to run ever since until this project eventuated and it's been a very long journey.' Cemetery, Adelaide, 2007 . Dice, country road, Western Australia, 2011 . His mother's ashes were 'thrown to the wind', leaving Parke with no memories or place to go to feel close to this mum. 'One day she was here the next she was gone,' he said. For the exhibition, which is mostly about life's questions, luck and chance, Parke strived to expose his soul. However, he admits that he wakes up every day thinking of his exhibition. 'I'm just sick of thinking; I can't remember a time when I didn't have a thought in my head,' he said. 'There’s a lot of layers to it. Hopefully it’s an exhibition where people can walk through it and visually see some good photography. 'It’s always about discovering things so hopefully people will make the same discoveries if they dig hard enough hand they can see the connections between all things.'

Abbott seemed unphased by the peculiarity of the stunt and merely looked as if he were eating a fresh apple.

All article text:Police have released chilling CCTV footage of a women walking alone just minutes before she was fatally stabbed to death while she was on the phone to her husband. Prabha Arun Kumar, a 41-year-old Indian national, was seriously injured by a sharp object on a public walkway between Argyle Street, Parramatta, and Amos Street, Westmead on Saturday night, just 300m from her home. Ambulance Paramedics treated the IT professional at the scene before transporting her to Westmead Hospital, where she died about 12.45am yesterday. Scroll down for video . Prabha Arun Kumar (pictured) a 41-year-old Indian national, was seriously injured by a sharp object on a public walkway between Argyle Street, Parramatta, and Amos Street, Westmead on Saturday night . Prabha was talking to her husband, G. Arun Kumar, who lives in India with their 10-year-old daughter, when a suspicious man appeared. Her husband then heard her screaming before the line went dead. He did not hear about his wife's death until he arrived in Sydney on Sunday morning. 'She was walking while talking to Arun on the phone when she said that a suspicious-looking man was following her,' her brother-in-law, Thrijesh Jayachandra, told The Hindu. 'The next moment, he heard her scream for help and then plead with the man not to harm [her] and take all her belongings if he wanted. Seconds later, he heard her scream and say she was stabbed.' Ambulance Paramedics treated the IT professional at the scene before transporting her to Westmead Hospital, where she died about 12.45am yesterday . It's believed Prabha got off a train at Parramatta Railway Station about 9pm, before walking along Argyle Street and turning left onto the walkway. Police believe she was attacked while on the walkway. She sustained a number of injuries, which police believe were inflicted by a sharp-edged weapon. A woman who was stabbed in a 'horrific' attack has been identified as Prabha Arun . Nearby resident Arvand Amirian told 9News he had found Ms Arun with blood all over her body after hearing 'crying screams' that 'didn't sound normal'. 'There was blood covering her face, her neck, her chest - her chest wasn't even moving so that's when I assumed she was gone,' Amirian said. Her  friend Sarada Angadimani, who Ms Arun was staying with, told 9News: 'Prabha was a really hard working, beautiful person. And, most importantly, a loving mother.' 'I hope God gives the family enough strength to endure this pain.' Prabha,  who moved to Sydney in 2012 for an off-site project with global technology firm Mindtree, was expected to return to India for a family reunion in April. 'She last called me three days ago, when she said it was taxing for her to stay away from family,' her aunt Bharathi Jayachandra said. She complained that work pressure was severe, and she planned to return home for good in April.' Prabha's elder brother, Shankar Shetty lives in Perth and identified her body on Saturday night. Prabha was talking to her husband, G. Arun Kumar, when a suspicious man appeared. Her husband then heard her screaming before the line went dead . It's believed Prabha got off a train at Parramatta Railway Station about 9pm, before walking along Argyle Street and turning left onto the walkway . Strike Force Marcoala has been formed to investigate the death. It compromises police from Parramatta Local Area Command and State Crime Command's Homicide Squad. Police are hoping that the images will jog the memory of anyone who was in the vicinity of Argyle Street, Park Parade or Amos Street that evening, and encourage them to come forward and speak with police. Superintendent Michael Willing has appealed to the public for help. 'We are really at a loss at this point in time as to who may be responsible,' he said. The 41-year-old was stabbed to death on this walkway in Parramatta . Flowers have been laid in the Sydney park where her body was found . The CCTV footage didn't appear to show anyone following the victim when she left the station about 9pm, he said. 'It's a horrific crime; (she) was killed in a very vicious way,' Supt Willing said. It's believed Mrs Kumar was stabbed in the neck on the path through Parramatta Park that cuts between a golf course and a high school. Results from a post-mortem examination should be ready on Monday afternoon or early on Tuesday and will hopefully give police a lead. Mindtree general manager Anoop George said her colleagues were devastated. Locals have left flowers and tributes on the path where she died. 'My prayers are with you and your family. Lots of love. Mary,' one tribute said. Prabha's elder brother, Shankar Shetty lives in Perth and identified her body on Saturday night . Locals from Sydney paid their respects at the scene today .

Codrick Beal had been staying overnight at a friend of his mother's in north Harris County, Texas when he fatally shot himself just before noon on Sunday. He had been visiting the home while his mother, Ashley Beal, celebrated her birthday. His father, Codrick McCall, was also not at the scene of the shooting. It is still unclear how the boy came across the firearm and authorities continue to investigate. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Four-year-old Codrick Beal, pictured, shot himself dead after finding a gun while staying with a family friend in Houston, Texas over the weekend. His mother had been celebrating her birthday at the time . Loss: Codrick's mother and father (pictured with the boy, left) were not at the home at the time of the shooting . After the boy was found, relatives and friends were seen comforting each other outside the house in the 19000 block of Imperial Stone. 'My baby is gone!' the boy's mother Ashley cried outside the home as authorities swept the property. Codrick, her only child, was reportedly staying with a long-time friend of his mother's. The babysitter had to be collected by EMS, having sobbed so hard that she collapsed on the road outside the house in convulsions. 'It's just a terrible accident,' Ashley's cousin, Leticia Beal told the Houston Chronicle.  'We see it all the time on the news but you never think it'll hit home. It's the most horrible thing.' The boy's paternal grandmother also wept as she paid tribute to youngster on Sunday. Distraught: Family and friends weep outside the Houston home where a four-year-old boy shot himself .

Pained: Loved ones console each other after the news that the four-year-old had fatally shot himself . Heartbreaking: This is the second child to die in an accidental shooting in Houston in as many days . 'Four years old. He had so much to live for,' Sharron McCall told KTRK. 'You can't bring death back. What has happened has happened. All we can do is try to pick up the pieces and continue with life there is nothing else to do.' She did not shed anymore light on the death but said she thinks her grandson should still be here. 'They sell you safety locks with your firearm when you purchase it,' she said. Authorities from the Harris County Sheriff's Office investigated the scene but have not disclosed the kind of gun was fired or who the owned it. Deputies said no charges have yet been brought and a Harris County grand jury would decide if any one should be charged in the death. Sadness: Codrick's paternal grandmother, Sharron McCall, said she had no idea how the accident happened because guns should have safety locks. Through tears, she said her grandson had so much to live for . Loved: Four-year-old Codrick, pictured with his grandmother, was his mother's only child . 'He was a loveable baby,' said Keith Beal, Ashley's uncle. 'Very funny, he loved to play around all the time. He just had so much life in him, he was always a happy baby.' A spokeswoman for Harris County Child Protective Services said they are also investigating. KTRK reported that CPS has previously responded to calls regarding the boy's parents but had never been sent to the home where the boy died. The tragic death is the second time a child has died in Houston of an accidental shooting in less than a week with a three-year-old reportedly killed Friday in Harris County. That boy's mother was in the house when she heard the gunshot and rushed to find him with a bullet wound to the neck and jaw. The boy  died at Memorial Hermann Hospital. See below for video .

All article text:New Delhi (CNN)The quest to be educated in India has literally scaled new heights. Images of parents and family members clambering up school buildings and clinging on window ledges to pass cheat sheets to their children have left authorities in despair. The incident took place on Wednesday in the state of Bihar, where students were writing their year-end grade 10 examinations. Examples of cheating incidents are not hard to find in India. But, even compared to previous events, this seems to be unprecedented in its blatancy. Bihar Education Minister PK Shahi told reporters that children won't learn if they're constantly helped by family members. "Government can only hold fair examinations with the help of the parents, society and the children," he said. "This is a collective responsibility." In a developing economy like India, education is a precious commodity. With more than 1.2 billion people, proper schooling could hold the key for much of the population to get out of a vicious cycle of poverty. Earlier this week, a father in the city of Mathura was caught strapping his 8-year old daughter to a motorcycle after she refused to attend school to take her assessment. Tied with a multi-strand rope to the back of a bike, onlookers captured images of the trussed girl, her bare feet hanging low, scraping the asphalt. According to local police officials, the girl's parents offered her several incentives, such as chocolates and toys to entice her, however when the girl was still reluctant, her father decided to take matters in his own hands. After photos started making the rounds on social media, police officials took the man into custody and charged him with "breach of the peace." He is now out on bail. "Even after he got out, the father showed no remorse. He has five children to feed and he believes the only way they can get out of this poverty trap is through education," a senior police official handling the case told CNN. The flaws in India's education system are well-documented. The country has a literacy rate of only 74%, compared to 95% in China. Women suffer particularly badly here; only 64% have formal education. Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nationwide campaign urging parents to send their children, especially daughters, to school and properly educate them. According to the United Nations, India has the largest youth population in the world, with more than a quarter of citizens aged between 10 and 24.

Photographer Bryan Derballa, 32, captured the incredible crayon-making process during a visit to the factory in Easton, Pennsylvania. Crayola, which was founded in 1885, uses a complicated production line to make the iconic colouring sticks. Mr Derballa's pictures provide a fascinating glimpse into the creation of the crayons which certainly take many of us back to our childhoods. Scroll down for video . Photographer Bryan Derballa took these stunning pictures inside the Crayola factory. Here, crayons are separated and funnelled into boxes . A rotary table moulds coloured paraffin into wax crayons at the factory in Easton. Excess wax is caught by a scraper blade and recycled . A mixing kettle full of paraffin and orange powdered pigment is stirred up before being moulded into crayons at the Crayola factory in Easton . The photographer, from New York, said he walked for miles as he photographed the manufacturing process. He said: 'The factory was massive. I probably walked a couple of miles during the course of our shoot just moving from one end of the factory to the other. 'That doesn't even include the storage and shipping departments that we saw but didn't really cover. His pictures show a silo, which contains 100,000lbs of uncoloured paraffin wax and is heated and moved to mixing kettles. Powdered pigment is then added to create a colour. The coloured liquid is then pumped into a water-cooled mould, before it is ejected through crayon-shaped cavities and sent for labelling. Anthony Breton, who works in general utility at the factory, adds orange pigment to paraffin to make crayons at the Pennsylvania factory . Orange crayons file through the mould table to the labeller, left, and right, labels wrap  around orange crayons at the Crayola factory in Easton . Once labels are attached, completed crayons are separated by funnels, which help sort them into 24 count boxes to be sold . Once the label has been attached, the crayons roll off the production line and are fed into funnels, which help sort them into boxes. Finally, the boxes are date coded and checked via a metal detector, which confirms there are only crayons inside. Mr Derballa added: 'I loved the mixing kettles where the pigment is mixed with the melted wax - they were these beautiful vats of molten colour. 'One of the best parts of this shoot was how earnest and innocent it all was. 'And the smell of paraffin brought me back to my childhood.' A mixing kettle full of paraffin and cerise pigment is stirred up, left, and right, the paraffin is moulded into cerise crayons by the rotary table .

All article text:Alberto Contador will end his career with Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016, the multiple grand tour winner has announced. The Spanish rider has committed to the squad for his final season before retiring at the end of 2016. Contador wrote on Twitter: 'Hello all, happy to announce that in 2016 will continue being rider of @tinkoff-saxo'. Multiple Grand Tour winner Alberto Contador has announced he will end his career with Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016 . The 32-year-old Spaniard is one of just six riders to have won all three Grand Tours . Tinkoff-Saxo team boss Oleg Tinkov said on Twitter: 'Best stays with the best'. Contador is among the favourites for the 2015 Tour de France, which begins on July 4 in Utrecht. The 32-year-old is one of six riders to have won all three grand tours - of France, Italy and Spain. In 2014 Contador crashed out of the Tour de France, but responded by winning the Vuelta a Espana. Contador won the 2007 and 2009 Tours de France - he was stripped of the 2010 title for an anti-doping infringement - the 2008 Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta in 2008, 2012 and 2014. Contador lifts the Giro d'Italia trophy in 2011 while riding for the Saxo Bank team . Contador celebrates winning the Vuelta a Espana in 2014 - it was his third time winning it . Tinkov said in a media release: 'I'm very happy that Alberto will lead Tinkoff-Saxo in 2016 as well, because I truly believe he is the best cyclist in the world and I am convinced he will continue to be so for a few more years. 'Unfortunately, he decided he would retire at the end of next year which means he will race with my team for two full seasons. I would have, obviously, preferred him to stay longer but that was his personal decision. 'However, I am very proud that Alberto's impressive career will conclude in my team and I hope he takes the Tinkoff-Saxo colours to the top step of the Tour de France podium in 2015 and 2016.' Contador added: 'I am very happy to have closed the deal. It is already five years that I have been working with (team manager) Bjarne Riis and the possibility to continue for another year is satisfying.' Contador lifts the Tour de France trophy after winning the competition in 2009 ahead of Lance Armstrong .

All article text:A thousand year-old potion made out of onions, garlic, wine and bile from a cow's stomach can kill hospital superbugs, scientists claim. The potent 10th century brew - used by Anglo Saxons to treat a stye (an abscess on the eyelid) destroyed 90 per cent of the bacteria on scraps of skin taken from mice with MRSA. Interestingly, the ingredients had little effect unless they were all brought together into the concoction, the study by Nottingham University researchers found. The garlic-based 'potion', listed in a thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon manuscript, has been found to kill off the MRSA superbug . Nottingham University microbiologists Dr Freya Harrison and Dr Steve Diggle with the garlic-based 'potion' The ancient remedy, called Bald's eyesalve, originates from a manuscript in Bald's Leechbook - an Old English leatherbound volume in the British Library. The Leechbook is widely thought of as one of the earliest known medical textbooks and contains Anglo-Saxon medical advice and recipes for medicines, salves and treatments. After using the solution on lab animals with MRSA - one of the most antibiotic-resistant bugs costing modern health services billions - the researchers described their results as 'astonishing.' Associate Professor Dr Christina Lee, of the University of Nottingham, said: 'Medieval leech books and herbaria contain many remedies designed to treat what are clearly bacterial infections - weeping wounds and sores, eye and throat infections, skin conditions such as the erysipelas rash, leprosy and chest infections. A strain of the hospital superbug MRSA can be carried by pets and livestock, say scientists who have found evidence the infection can pass from animals to humans. Researchers at Cambridge University have found two separate cases where people were infected with the strain of infection, and livestock were found to be the cause. And genetic tests show cats and dogs have the same strain of the bacterium as people. It means MRSA could spread between animals at veterinary clinics in a similar way to hospital infections. But scientists at the university moved to reassure pet owners, adding there is very little risk of them falling ill as a result of an infection passed from their pets. It comes after cats passed TB to humans for the first time in an outbreak in Newbury, Berkshire last year, feared to have been caused by badgers. Two people from the same household were treated for bovine tuberculosis after they caught the disease from their kitten. 'Given these remedies were developed well before the modern understanding of germ theory, this poses two questions. 'How systematic was the development of these remedies and how effective were these remedies against the likely causative species of bacteria? 'Answering these questions will greatly improve our understanding of medieval scholarship and medical empiricism and may reveal new ways of treating serious bacterial infections that continue to cause illness and death.' The Anglo Saxon expert came up with the idea of trying out the recipe. It describes a very specific method of making the solution, including the use of a brass vessel to brew it in, a strainer to purify it and an instruction to leave the mixture for nine days before use. She enlisted the help of microbiologists who believe the potion's bacteria-killing effect is not due to a single ingredient but the combination used, brewing methods and container material. Further research is planned to investigate how and why this works. Dr Lee said: 'We were genuinely astonished at the results of our experiments in the lab. 'We believe modern research into disease can benefit from past responses and knowledge which is largely contained in non-scientific writings. 'But the potential of these texts to contribute to addressing the challenges cannot be understood without the combined expertise of both the arts and science.' The garlic family of plants make chemicals than interfere with bacteria's ability to damage infected tissues. But researchers found all the ingredients together created the best result . The scientists made four separate batches of the remedy using fresh ingredients each time as well as a control treatment using the same quantity of distilled water and brass sheet to mimic the brewing container but without the vegetable compounds. The remedy was tested on cultures of the commonly found - and hard to treat - bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in both synthetic wounds and in infected wounds in mice. None of the individual ingredients alone had any measurable effect, but when combined according to the recipe, the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) populations of bacteria, were almost totally obliterated. Only about one bacterial cell in a thousand survived. Microbiologist Dr Freya Harrison, also of the University of Nottingham, said: 'We thought Bald's eyesalve might show a small amount of antibiotic activity because each of the ingredients has been shown by other researchers to have some effect on bacteria in the lab. Copper and bile salts can kill bacteria and the garlic family of plants make chemicals that interfere with the bacteria's ability to damage infected tissues. 'But we were absolutely blown away by just how effective the combination of ingredients was. 'We tested it in difficult conditions too; we let our artificial "infections" grow into dense, mature populations called "biofilms", where the individual cells bunch together and make a sticky coating that makes it hard for antibiotics to reach them. 'But unlike many modern antibiotics, Bald's eye salve has the power to breach these defences.' The findings were presented at the Annual Conference of the Society for General Microbiology in Birmingham.
