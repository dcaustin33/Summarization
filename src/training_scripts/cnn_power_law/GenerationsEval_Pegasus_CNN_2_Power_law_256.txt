All article text:A man who killed five members of the same family in a drunk driving accident was confronted by the one family member who survived in a courtroom on Tuesday. A brave Stephanie Guzman, 16, stared right at 35-year-old Efraim Carmona and told him what it was like to wake up from a coma and learn that every member of her family was dead. Carmona, who had a blood alcohol level of .23 at the time of the crash in Houston, Texas, took a plea and will serve 50 years in prison. All this as Guzman still remains in a wheelchair with her face and body covered in scars from the crash, which took place last June. Stephanie Guzman (above), 16, faced Efraim Carmona in a Houston Texas courtroom on Tuesday as he was sentenced on six counts of drunk driving . Carmona (above), 35, was drunk and driving the wrong way when he hit a truck carrying Guzman, her parents and her three siblings . 'It was just a moment that I couldn't believe,' said Guzman. 'It was hard for me when I found out, when they came to me and were like, "sorry for your loss." I was like, that's a lie! I couldn't believe it.' Guzman had lost her father, Valentin Guzman, 41; mother, 40-year-old Elvira Guzman Santoy; sisters Ani and Patricia, 12 and 11; and 3-year-old brother, Valentin Jr. Yet when speaking about Carmona later with KHOU, Guzman made it clear she was dealing with the tragedy, and doing her best to move on in the aftermath. 'I forgive him because I'm really not God. The one that he needs to say sorry to is God, not to me,' she said. As for her family, Guzman stated; 'I know that they are happy for me, why? Because they were there for me and I really thank God and I'm really thankful because I had great parents no matter what. They were still there for me.' Now, Guzman is focused on working hard and getting out of her wheelchair. Guzman had lost her father, Valentin Guzman, 41; mother, 40-year-old Elvira Guzman Santoy; sisters Ani and Patricia, 12 and 11; and 3-year-old brother, Valentin Jr. (all above) Guzman (above) discussed how difficult it was to wake up from a coma and learned her entire family had been killed . Carmona was driving a flatbed truck when he entered the Sam Houston Tollway’s westbound lanes but he was tragically heading east that June. He then hit the packed Ford F-150 pickup carrying the entire Guzman family head-on, which immediately burst into flames. The fact that Stephanie survived has till be hailed as a 'miracle.' The crash was so bad that the victims could not even be identified for week saves Stephanie, who was in a coma. Carmona pleaded guilty to five counts of intoxication manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault.

All article text:The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage . Controversial Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will keep her job if the Tories win the election, the Prime Minister revealed yesterday. David Cameron said Mrs Morgan will be put in charge of plans to create 500 new free schools, which he claimed would drive up standards across the country. He said the schools – which can be set up by parents, faith groups or other organisations – were helping to wrest control of education out of the hands of 'pointy-heads in Whitehall'. He claimed the Tories are 'the only party that is opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children', adding: 'With me as Prime Minister and Nicky Morgan as Education Secretary, that's exactly what you're going to get.' Mrs Morgan is said to be 'delighted' to be the first Cabinet minister to be guaranteed her job if her party wins in May. But the move will alarm critics, who have accused her of watering down the radical approach to schools reform taken by her predecessor, Michael Gove. The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage, which she opposed before joining the Cabinet. But friends say she is only carrying out Downing Street's orders to mend fences with the teaching establishment, which Mr Gove derided as 'the Blob'. A Tory source said last night: 'The Prime Minister is a big fan of Nicky Morgan – he thinks she is doing a good job.' The Education Secretary confirmed that a future Tory government would not allow free schools to make a profit – an idea that was floated by Mr Gove but blocked by the Lib Dems. Free schools legislation allows groups to establish new state-funded schools which are independent of local authorities. As with academies, they do not have to teach the National Curriculum. Fewer than 300 have been opened to date, although 49 were given the green light yesterday. Labour has claimed it would not allow any more to open – and warned existing free schools could be placed under some form of local authority control. The move will alarm critics, who have accused her of watering down the radical approach to schools reform taken by her predecessor, Michael Gove (pictured) But Mr Cameron said a Tory-led government would open 500 new free schools after the election. Speaking at an academy in West London yesterday, he hailed the reforms as 'the most successful schools programme in recent British history'. He also insisted he is not trying to block controversial plans to allow a grammar school in Kent to expand by opening an 'annexe' in another town, saying: 'Grammar schools are good schools and I like good schools. 'Like other schools, if they are good, and want to expand, they should be able to.' Mrs Morgan is expected to take legal advice in the coming days on whether she can approve the expansion of the Weald of Kent Grammar School in Tonbridge, which wants to open a new site nine miles away in Sevenoaks.

The Ukrainian side had Olexandr Kucher sent off after just three minutes - the quickest in the tournament's history - but the Spaniard's side remained professional throughout and the statistics make for impressive reading. After a tight 0-0 in the first leg, Guardiola was pleased with Bayern's performance and their ability to see the tie through. Pep Guardiola was delighted with his 'dominant' players after their emphatic victory over Shakhtar . Olexandr Kucher (right) brings down Mario Gotze and was sent off with Bayern scoring from the penalty . Thomas Muller (right) scored an impressive double for the German champions to carry on his terrific form . 'We are very pleased,' he admitted. 'We deserved the win. The players did fantastically. 'Of course it is a little easier against 10 men. But from the beginning we could see that the team was alert. Congratulations to the team, we dominated the game.' The scoreline was far from flattering for the German champions and it could have been more with the 25 shots they mustered up over 90 minutes. Bayern had 25 shots with 13 on target compared to Shakthar's three throughout the Champions League clash . Thomas Muller got a double, including a penalty following the red card. Jerome Boateng, Franck Ribery, Holger Badstuber, Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze also found the net - showing that Guardiola's side can score goals from all over the pitch. Incredibly, Arjen Robben was the outfield only player who started to not score or get an assist during the demolition of the Ukrainian side - and he was taken off injured after 19 minutes. This was the second time the Germans struck seven past the opposition in the Champions League following their stunning 7-1 win over Roma back in October. Arjen Robben was taken off after 19 minutes and was the only player to not score or provide an assist . Defender Holger Badstuber (28) scored a rare goal as he powered home a header to score the fifth .

All article text:Earth may have been witness to a stunning aurora displays, but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on Mars. Because Mars has a very thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows. And their behaviour doesn't always follow existing rules. Nasa scientists were recently stunned to discover aurora that reaches deep into the Martian atmosphere. Artist’s conception of Maven's Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) observing the “Christmas Lights Aurora" on Mars. Maven observations show that aurora on Mars is similar to Earth’s "Northern Lights" but penetrates deep into the atmosphere . Earth has a magnetic shield, known as a magnetosphere, that protects its atmosphere from radiation from the sun. Aurora take place on Earth because some of the sun's energetic particles have managed to break through this shield. Mars, however, only has a very thin atmosphere. Its magnetosphere was lost billions of years ago turning a once watery world into the barren planet we see today. When solar particles hit the red planet, they can hit the atmosphere directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows. Maven's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) also observed what scientists have named 'Christmas lights.' For five days just before Dec. 25, Maven saw a bright ultraviolet auroral glow spanning Mars' northern hemisphere. Aurora, known on Earth as northern or southern lights, are caused by energetic particles like electrons crashing down into the atmosphere and causing the gas to glow. 'What's especially surprising about the aurora we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs - much deeper than at Earth or elsewhere on Mars,' said Arnaud Stiepen, IUVS team member at the University of Colorado. 'The electrons producing it must be really energetic.' The source of the energetic particles appears to be the sun. Maven's Solar Energetic Particle instrument detected a huge surge in energetic electrons at the onset of the aurora. Billions of years ago, Mars lost a global protective magnetic field like Earth has, so solar particles can directly strike the atmosphere. The electrons producing the aurora have about 100 times more energy than you get from a spark of house current, so they can penetrate deeply in the atmosphere. They also made the unexpected discovery of dust about 93 miles (150 km) to 190 miles (300 km) above the red planet's surface. Although the source and composition of the dust are unknown, Nasa said there is no hazard to Maven probe and other spacecraft orbiting Mars. A map of Maven's auroral detections in December 2014 overlaid on Mars’ surface. The map shows that the aurora was widespread in the northern hemisphere, not tied to any geographic location. The aurora was detected in all observations during a 5-day period . 'If the dust originates from the atmosphere, this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the Martian atmosphere,' said Laila Andersson of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospherics and Space Physics (CU LASP), Boulder, Colorado. It is unknown if the cloud is a temporary phenomenon or something long lasting. The cloud density is greatest at lower altitudes. However, even in the densest areas it is still very thin. So far, no indication of its presence has been seen in observations from any of the other Maven instruments. Possible sources for the observed dust include dust wafted up from the atmosphere; dust coming from Phobos and Deimos, the two moons of Mars; dust moving in the solar wind away from the sun; or debris orbiting the sun from comets. However, no known process on Mars can explain the appearance of dust in the observed locations from any of these sources. The findings are being presented this week at the 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas. Earth may have been witness to a stunning displays of the aurora (pictured), but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on Mars Because has a thin atmosphere, the sun's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper.  Nasa has only been able to detect the aurora rather capture it in an image .

All article text:Photographer Reuben Krabbe had been dreaming of capturing the Northern Lights for four years. He finally persuaded a group of skier friends to join him on a risky mission to ski down the snow-capped Tombstone Mountains, in Canada, as the spectacular show glimmered above them. Krabbe and friends, Tobin Seagel, Dave Gheriani, and Joel Jacques, travelled for six days to reach Tombstone Territorial Park in Yukon, braving avalanches and sub zero temperatures. The off-piste skiing location boasts some of the best views of the Northern Lights in Canada. Scroll down for video . Spectacular slalom: Professional ski and mountain bike photographer Reuben Krabbe, 24, travelled with three friends to take pictures of the mystical display . Temperatures at night reached -33 degrees Celsius, but that did not discourage the adventurous group from carrying on with their six day mission . The off-piste skiing location boasts some of the best views of the Northern Lights in Canada, which Krabbe described as 'mesmerising' When the group started the journey to the 1,500ft mountains, they encountered temperatures dropping to a freezing -33 degrees Celsius. They were unperturbed, and remained dedicated to their mission to slalom under the natural light show. Professional ski and mountain bike photogragher Reuben Krabbe, 24, said: 'We all wanted to make the trip happen, and Tobin and I had talked about trying to capture the single photograph of the Northern Lights and a skier. 'We spent a total of six days on the slopes, from leaving our truck to arriving back at it. 'The moment was very unusual and mesmerising. 'It was difficult to concentrate on a specific task when such a beautiful thing is happening above you.' The photographer has been skiing since his parents taught him at the age of four, and it has since become a massive part of his life. All the skiing conditions on the mission were off-piste, and in avalanche conditions, up the high mountains. The team braved avalanche and harsh weather conditions but Krabbe fulfilled his four-year wish to capture the Northern Lights in Canada . Friends Tobin Seagel, Dave Gheriani, and Joel Jacques spent six days with Krabbe traversing the Tombstone Territorial Park in Yukon, Canada . To witness the natural disco in its magnificence, you have to head north towards the Arctic, above latitude 60 degrees . The cause of the stunning Northern Lights is solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, creating the  beautiful, natural light show. The electrically charged particles are drawn to the Earth's poles and their colours are a result of the different gases in the atmosphere. In the northern hemisphere they are known as the aurora borealis, and many tourists flock to witness the ethereal display, despite the often high cost and cold temperatures. The mysterious show also occurs in the southern hemisphere, the aurora australis, its main audience being the penguins. Krabbe said: 'I love to create images that last in a person's head, and I think about it for a long time before I capture it. 'So, a single shot like the northern lights will always be special.' The Northern Lights are caused by solar wind interacting with the Earth's magnetic field, creating the  beautiful  light show . The skiers spent a total of six days on the slopes, braving sub-zero temperatures to view the Northern Lights in action . Krabbe said: 'I love to create images that last in a person's head, and I think about it for a long time before I capture it.'So, a single shot like the northern lights will always be special' Dangerous conditions! The group were not put off by the off-piste, dangerous mountain landscape, and completed their mission to ski under the magical light show .

All article text:(CNN)Three teen British girls suspected of traveling to Syria to join ISIS appeared on surveillance video in Turkey before they went to their destination. Images show the teens boarding a bus in Istanbul, Turkish HBR television reported. It's the first sighting of the girls since they left London almost two weeks ago. Authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in Turkey and believe they have crossed into neighboring Syria, parts of which have been taken over by Islamist terror group ISIS. The three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- boarded a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. A British counterterrorism officer said police had tried to reach out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media to persuade them to return home. The girls' parents have also publicly begged for them to come home. Days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media. An attorney for the Mahmood family said the family was "surprised, horrified" that the contact had not prompted police action "because they understood that Aqsa's social media content was being closely monitored by the security services." "And the real concern that arises is that if a known member of ISIS who's now a poster girl for ISIS, seen to be recruiting and spreading propaganda, is in touch with young people in our country -- that one would expect the courtesy of a knock on the door of these families, to advise them that their children may be on the cusp of radicalization or going off to Syria," Aamer Anwar said. The Mahmood family condemned their daughter's actions, describing them "as a perverted and evil distortion" of Islam. But they also said the UK security services "have serious questions to answer" over their failure to intervene after one or more of the missing girls got in touch with her. Turkey has become the most traveled route for volunteers trying to join Syria's many armed factions since an anti-government uprising erupted  more than three years ago. Initially, Ankara maintained an "open door policy," allowing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to flee to safety in Turkey. Turkish border guards looked the other way, taking few steps to stop activists, volunteers and journalists from crossing into Syria. But with the rise of the ultra-violent Islamist group ISIS in Syria, the Turkish government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through Turkey to get into Syria. Some critics have accused Ankara of actively supporting ISIS against rival Kurdish rebel groups, charges the Turkish government has angrily denied. Last year, the Turkish government showed CNN new barricades, thermal cameras and fences aimed at better fortifying the border. Historically, the Turkish-Syrian border, which runs more than 800 kilometers (500 miles), has been notoriously difficult for Turkish security forces to control. Before the Syrian civil war, both smugglers and Kurdish separatist guerrillas were known to operate illegally between the two countries. Turkish government officials have bristled in response to accusations that they are not stemming the flow of foreign fighters joining ISIS. Millions of tourists visit Turkey every year, where visas can be obtained upon arrival for citizens of many countries.

Much of the build-up to that slot will focus on Jose Mourinho facing Louis van Gaal, with points on the line for the title race and Champions League qualification. Arsenal’s game against Championship Reading may play second fiddle in the eyes of many neutral football fans. But FA sources insist viewing figures for their match, broadcast on the BBC, will far outstrip the Premier League contest shown on Sky.

Arsenal players celebrate after beating Hull in the FA Cup final at Wembley last year . Blackburn players salute their fans after they earned an FA Cup replay against Liverpool . The BBC had first pick of the semi-finals and elected for the time and day that is likely to yield their greatest TV audience. The scheduling of the Premier League match would not feature heavily among considerations. BT Sport picked up Aston Villa’s semi-final against either Liverpool or Blackburn and that will kick-off at 3pm on Sunday April 19. It does mean an trickier trip home by train for northern supporters than a Saturday fixture would have represented, but it is understood Metropolitan Police were reluctant to have Liverpool and United fans potentially travelling to and from London Euston at similar times.

All article text:(CNN)Reading the headlines out of Madison, Wisconsin, it's hard not to think about Ferguson, Missouri. But law enforcement's response to the shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson will not unfold in the same chaotic, violent and distrusting way as the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, Madison's top police leaders vowed. "I think it's very clear that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri," said Jim Palmer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The head of the state's largest law enforcement group told CNN Monday that the Madison police department, unlike the Ferguson department, has a strong relationship with the people it serves. Madison Police Chief Mike Koval has been out front and outspoken about Robinson's shooting since it happened late Friday night. The chief said he understands people are angry and want answers. "We have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold," he said. Here are some ways Madison law enforcement appears to be responding differently than what was seen in Ferguson: . Difference in what police chiefs did after shooting . Madison: Within hours of the shooting, Koval went to Robinson's mother's home. "We need to start as any healing or any reconciliation should with an 'I'm sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years if at all to mend," the police chief said. The mother didn't want to meet with him but the chief talked and prayed with the biracial teenager's grandparents in the driveway, he said. They told Koval to hold off on trying to talk to the mother because emotions were too intense. "I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences," Koval said. "Nineteen years old is too young." He stressed that "the effort has to be there," in reaching out to the family. "We have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold, as it were." Ferguson: A day after Brown, who was African-American, was killed, protesters took to the streets of the Missouri town. They were incensed that witnesses said Brown's hands were up and that the teen's body had remained in the street, in the sun, for four hours. A month went by before Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson apologized to Brown's family. "I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street," he said, in a videotaped message. A day after Brown's killing a vigil for him devolved into violence. Police tried to keep the crowd under control but clashes erupted. One officer was seen holding the leash of a barking dog, and St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said some officers wielded shotguns. Four days after Brown was killed and more than a day after riots erupted in Ferguson, Jackson spoke at a community forum, saying, the situation "has been a tragedy for the city and the country." Responding to criticism that he'd missed immediate opportunities to address tension in the town that turned into violence, he said, "It breaks my heart [that] some think I'm part of the problem." The police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution. But issues with how the department interacted with protesters and media continued. "Keep moving" was a common refrain that police told protesters and law enforcement threatened to arrest anyone who stood along sidewalks, whether they were resting or a reporter taking notes. In some cases, officers told demonstrators they couldn't stand for more than five seconds; some protesters were yelled at for walking too slowly. Such a tactic was a violation of the Constitution, a federal judge later ruled. In his videotaped message, Jackson apologized for that, too. "The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry," the police chief said. Five ways the Ferguson police chief is in hot water . Difference in investigation procedures: . Madison: Under Wisconsin law, an outside agency is tasked with investigating police-involved shootings. In the case in Madison, that would be the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes its work, findings will be delivered to the local district attorney, Chief Koval said. On Monday, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement saying that another layer of investigation will come from the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which will conduct an independent investigation -- a requirement of all officer-involved deaths. Ferguson: Chief Jackson asked the St. Louis County Police Department to conduct an independent investigation into Brown's killing. It was only a few days that passed between the shooting and when Jon Belmar, the chief of St. Louis County Police Department, told media what led to Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shooting Brown. "The genesis of this was a physical confrontation," Belmar said. Brown "physically assaulted" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon. Differences with timing of releasing the officer's name . Madison: Chief Koval released the name of the officer who shot Robinson within hours of the incident. He is 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny. The chief volunteered that the officer had shot and killed a man in 2007. Kenny was cleared on any wrongdoing in that incident, the chief said, because an investigation determined that the man was killed in a "suicide by cop" situation. During the incident involving Robinson, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Ferguson: Three days after Brown was killed, Ferguson police backtracked on a promise made a day earlier to release the name of the officer. The reason the department gave? Threats made to another officer who was falsely accused on social media of shooting Brown, Jackson said. The chief said he thought the threats were "credible" and that "the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name, which is minimal." Lawyers representing Brown's family blasted the decision, and accused the police of protecting their own and ignoring standard procedures. Difference in how authorities described victim's past . Madison: Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. But when Koval was pressed for more details, he refused to talk about the teen's record or any run-ins with law enforcement. "I could but I choose not to," the chief said. "I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his." Ferguson: Six days after Brown's shooting -- on the same day police released Officer Wilson's name -- police released surveillance video of a convenience store robbery in which Brown was allegedly involved before he died. The decision to release that video frustrated many, including others in law enforcement. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson stated the robbery and shooting of Brown "are separate issues." "I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go," Johnson told CNN. "Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family." Differences in mayor's reaction immediately after shooting . Madison: Less than a day after the shooting, Mayor Paul Soglin vowed that "there will be answers," the Wisconsin State Journal reported.  "We all deserve to know the facts in this case," he said. "Tony Robinson's family deserves that, our community deserves that, and the Madison Police deserve that. When the answers come, we will be open and transparent in communicating them." The promise to be transparent in sharing results of an investigation were repeated on the city's web site. Ferguson: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles urged the community to stay calm and not escalate the situation. "We don't know what happened and there are lots of conflicting stories," Knowles said. "Unfortunately there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully we will get to an understanding and justice will be served." Speaking a day after a vigil for Brown devolved into a riot, Knowles said on CNN that "the events of last night are not indicative of who we are," and that the chaos was "not constructive" and only "bringing down the community." Difference in size and tone of rallies and tone . Madison: On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators gathered in Madison. "Who do we trust?" some called out, prompting the response, "No one!" And in another refrain, they chanted, "Black lives matter," a phrase that Ferguson protesters coined. Online the #WillyStreet hashtag, referencing to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened, trended. "Praying for Madison tonight," wrote one activist. "Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies." The demonstrations, which have been constant, have remained peaceful. Watch protesters outraged over police killing . Ferguson: Just hours after Brown was killed, a vigil for him turned violent as people hurled bottles at officers and kicked police cars parked on the streets. The often-violent demonstrations continued off and on for weeks, and protests around the country were held in solidarity. While many protesters were peaceful, in late November buildings were set on fire and destruction spread after a grand jury said it had decided not to indict Officer Wilson. Fire, chaos erupt in Ferguson after grand jury doesn't indict . CNN's Elise Miller, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Faith Karami, Kristina Sgueglia, Rosa Flores, Ralph Ellis, Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

All article text:(CNN)One is a 21-year-old California man accused of trying to travel to Syria to join ISIS. Another, a 17-year-old Virginia student charged with helping recruit for the radical Islamist group. Charges against both were released Wednesday, and they are just the latest in a growing number of similar cases from the United States. More than 20,000 foreigners have gone to fight for ISIS, the terror group that controls portions of Iraq and Syria, experts have told Congress. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said 180 Americans have tried to go to fight in Syria. It's unclear how many of those were attempting to join ISIS. Here are some of their stories: . Arrested at George H.W. Bush Houston Intercontinental Airport before a flight to Europe, Wolfe was charged in June "with attempting to provide material support to terrorists," authorities said. He "planned to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to radical groups engaged in armed conflict in Syria," according to a complaint. On February 2, 2014, an undercover agent met with Wolfe and his wife and they watched a YouTube video about foreign fighters in Syria, officials said. Wolfe allegedly discussed the activities of ISIS, they said. The 18-year-old from Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, pleaded guilty at a Minneapolis federal court to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to ISIS . Yusuf was stopped by the FBI from boarding a flight to Turkey from Minneapolis/Saint Paul Airport in May. Yusuf and another man, Abdi Nur, were charged in late November with conspiring to aid ISIS. Conley's plan to join ISIS and serve as a nurse at a jihadist camp ended in September with a guilty plea on a terror charge in a Colorado federal court. Arrested in April, the 19-year-old was at Denver International Airport about to embark on a journey to Germany and eventually to an ISIS camp near the Turkish border. She told investigators she was going to Turkey to await word from her suitor, an ISIS member she met on the Internet, whom she planned to marry. The Cincinnati 20-year-old was on the FBI's radar for months as he posted about violent jihad on social media. The feds said they arrested him before he could hatch his alleged plot. Reminiscent of the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, he planned to set off pipe bombs at the U.S. Capitol, and when employees and lawmakers fled the building, he and an accomplice would shoot them, according to a criminal complaint. Cornell allegedly told an informant he had been in contact with people overseas, and that he had aligned himself with ISIS. The attack, according to the complaint, would be a way of supporting the extremist group. The Stoughton, Massachusetts, man was first placed on the FBI terror list for 2009 crimes but since has been suspected of joining ISIS, officials said. He's fluent in both English and Arabic, and if his college degree in computers is any indication, he has a way with technology. Then there's his interest in radical Islam. Put it all together, and authorities said former Boston resident and U.S. citizen Ahmad Abousamra could be a good fit inside the ISIS social media machine that's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda across social media. The son of a Palestinian father and Italian-American mother, the 22-year-old from Vero Beach, Florida, is believed to be the first American suicide bomber to die in Syria. The former high school football playecr killed himself in May 2014 when he drove a truck full of explosives into a Syrian army position and detonated it, U.S. officials said. Three teenage girls who set out from a Denver suburb apparently bound for Syria to join extremists were sent home to their parents after they were stopped in Germany, U.S. officials said. The teens -- two sisters of Somali descent and a friend whose family is Sudanese, according to a Denver community leader -- were detained when their flight landed in Frankfurt on Friday after the FBI flagged their passports. The 21-year-old California man was arrested last summer, but was indicted on Wednesday. The FBI said he attempted to offer himself and material support to work under the direction and control of ISIS. His arraignment is scheduled for later this month. The 17-year-old Virginia student has been charged with helping recruit for ISIS, federal law enforcement officials said Wednesday. The teen lives in a suburb of Washington and is accused of helping a slightly older adult travel to Syria. The adult is believed to have joined ISIS there. The student is also accused of distributing ISIS messages. Arrested last month in New York and Florida, they are accused by the federal government of attempting to join ISIS and of fostering plans to kill the President and shoot law enforcement officers. The three men face charges that include attempting and conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. None were U.S. citizens, but Saidakhmetov, 19, and Juraboev, 24, had permanent resident status. Habibov, 30, was in the United States legally, but overstayed his visa, police said. The 20-year-old was charged with conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. Nur "conspired to join ISIL and travel from Minnesota to the Middle East to engage in a campaign of terror," Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin said in November, using another acronym for ISIS. Kahn was arrested at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in October. The 19-year-old is charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. In a letter to his parents, Kahn wrote that he was leaving the United States and on the way to join ISIS, court documents said. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. This 33-year-old man from New Hope, Minnesota, died in late August while fighting for ISIS, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. McCain's uncle said his nephew had gone to Syria to fight as a jihadi. The 19-year-old Somali-American woman slipped away from her parents in late August. She told them she was going to a bridal shower, but instead hopped a flight to Turkey and joined ISIS, Reuters reported. Another woman is suspected of helping her leave the country. U.S. authorities said he is an ISIS sympathizer.  Morgan was arrested on August 2 on arrival at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport from Frankfurt, Germany. A federal grand jury in North Carolina charged him with illegal weapons possession. The court documents make no mention of the ISIS connection, but U.S. officials said his Twitter postings support the terrorist group. Federal authorities accuse him of funding ISIS, trying to send jihadists to Syria to fight with the terrorist group and plotting to do some killing himself, by gunning down U.S. troops who had served in Iraq . The 30-year-old faces three counts of trying "to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization" (namely, ISIS), one count of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States, two counts of having an unregistered firearm silencer and one for possessing guns or silencers "in furtherance of a crime of violence," court documents say. The federal investigation into Elfgeeh began in early 2013, but he wasn't arrested until May 2014. Some 100 other Americans are believed to have either fought in Syria since 2011 or been arrested before they could get there, according to Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst. So far, no U.S. citizen involved in fighting or supporting ISIS or any other militant group has been charged with plotting to conduct an attack inside the United States, but that's the fear. Also, in none of the successful terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 -- such as the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013 or Maj. Nidal Hasan's massacre at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 -- did any of the convicted or alleged perpetrators receive training overseas. Former jihadist Mubin Shaikh said many of those who are attracted to ISIS or other militant causes are struggling to combine their Muslim and Western identities. "When you're dealing with first-, second-, even third-generation individuals from various ethnic backgrounds, there are still problems of acculturation and integration," he said.  They ask:  "Who am I supposed to be? " That's the challenge mosques and Western governments will have to deal with, Shaikh said.

All article text:(CNN)The UK's Metropolitan Police has summoned five football fans to answer allegations of racism. It relates to an incident captured on camera, prior to Chelsea's European Champions League match with Paris Saint-Germain last month. In the French capital before the match an apparent group of Chelsea fans are caught on camera, appearing to prevent a black man boarding the Paris Metro. The video, widely shared on social media, also depicted the group of men chanting: "We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it." The man in the video was blocked several times from boarding the train and shoved off at least twice. He was later identified as Souleymane S, a 33-year-old Parisian on his way home from work. London's Met Police had appealed for help to identify those responsible but in a statement released Wednesday, said five men were due in court later this month. It read: "On 10 March and 11 March, the Metropolitan Police Service served summonses on five men involved in incidents on the Paris Metro before the Paris Saint-Germain v Chelsea Champions League fixture on Tuesday 17 February. "They have been summonsed to appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, 25 March regarding a police application for football banning orders." The authorities have not identified any of the alleged perpetrators. Chelsea were quick to condemn the group, saying in a statement after the incident that the chanting was "abhorrent" and something that "has no place in football or society." Manager Jose Mourinho said he was "ashamed" by the flashpoint, while the club moved quickly to suspend the five men involved. It said they faced a life ban should they be found guilty. "I watched the image the next day, I didn't want to watch again, I watched only once," Mourinho told reporters a few days after the match in Paris. "It is enough for me, it is sad enough for me. It is a humiliation for that gentleman, I imagine myself in that same situation, I want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport." A club spokesperson also confirmed that Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich was "disgusted" by the incident whilst French President Francois Hollande personally spoke to Souleymane. Chelsea invited him to attend the return fixture at Stamford Bridge but he declined the offer. "I won't go," he was quoted as saying by French radio station RTL. "They can't buy me with a little piece of paper. I'm not a child. "I don't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me. I still hear the voices of those people who pushed me because of the color of my skin." Football banning orders can last for between three and ten years, and any breach can result in a criminal offense, with a prison sentence of up to six months.

Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania, is offering €500 (£350) to the right man, who will perform the bedroom necessities and then leave. Although the man will provide the sperm, he will have no parental rights over the child whatsoever. Adelina Albu, 25, from Timisoara, in western Romania has posted a Facebook advert asking for a man to impregnate her . According to The Mirror, Adelina posted the advert on her Facebook page with the words: 'Meeting men is not a problem. Meeting one who wants a baby is.' 'So, rather than wasting my time on a pointless relationship I’m going to pay for it.' Before she agrees to sleep with the potential partner or hand over any money, the man will have to undergo a fertility test and sign an agreement to waive rights as a father. Adelina added: 'Men are so immature all they think about is themselves. 'I am a mature, independent woman and I want a baby - not a man who behaves like one, but a proper one.' Adelina now has more than nine thousand followers on Facebook and even has her own fan page. Her announcement comes just a couple of weeks after a Russian woman advertised for a man to impregnate her online.

Taking to her Vkontakt page - the equivalent of a Facebook profile - she wrote: 'My mother needs grandchildren to give them all the baby clothes she has been collecting. But nobody wants to marry me yet. 'So, if you are young, strong and healthy drop me a line. 'My mother will be in charge of selecting the candidates and announcing the winner. She knows what I need.' She has already been inundated with offers from men, with many posting replies to her advert.

All article text:A 26-year-old man has been found guilty of sodomizing and strangling to death his girlfriend's four-month-old baby daughter in a horrific 2012 attack following just four hours of jury deliberations. Jordan Lafayette Prince was convicted on Thursday of brutally sexually assaulting and murdering little Ashlynn Lillith Peters at his mobile home in St Charles, Missouri. He is now facing life in prison. At a hearing earlier this year, Prince's girlfriend and Ashlynn's mother, Jessica Lynn Howell, 27, was jailed for 25 years after admitting felony murder and child abuse in relation to the infant's death. Howell had encouraged her boyfriend to sexually assault Ashlynn in the sickening attack, authorities said. The helpless baby was then beaten and strangled by Prince, apparently to silence her crying. Guilty: Jordan Lafayette Prince (pictured in his police mug shot) has been found guilty of sodomizing and strangling to death his girlfriend's four-month-old baby daughter following four hours of jury deliberations . On Thursday, Prince showed no emotion as he was convicted of first-degree murder, child abuse and forcible sodomy in the  killing of Ashlynn in December 2012, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. His attorney had  argued that prosecutors had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Prince had hurt Ashlynn, claiming  no DNA belonging to the suspect had been found to support their claims. Ashlynn was rushed to hospital on the morning of her death after being discovered lifeless and alone inside Prince's home in Deerfield Village. Despite medics' best efforts, she later died of her injuries. Although her cause of death was ruled to be asphyxiation, prosecutors said the forcible sodomy - carried out with an unknown object - had caused enough internal bleeding to have killed her. Shocking: Prince was convicted on Thursday of brutally sexually assaulting and murdering little Ashlynn Lillith Peters (pictured with her mother, Jessica Lynn Howell, who has been jailed in relation to her death) Scene: On Thursday, Prince showed no emotion as he was convicted of first-degree murder, child abuse and forcible sodomy in the killing of Ashlynn at his mobile home (pictured) in St Charles, Missouri, in 2012 . During Thursday's hearing,  assistant prosecutor Phil Groenweghe said Ashlynn's future hopes, dreams and achievements had been 'snuffed out' for 'one morning of sexual fun by this defendant'. Earlier in court, forensics expert Dan Fahnestock had testified that bloodstains found on the infant's blanket on the day of her assault and death were consistent with both the victim's and Prince's DNA. But he admitted he did not know how or when the blanket had been stained. Meanwhile, medical examiner Dr Mary Case told the court Ashlynn's neck bruises were consistent with strangulation. She also detailed the horrific injuries that Ashlynn had suffered during the sexual assault. They included severe blood loss that totaled around one-third of the infant's blood volume, STL reported. Convictions: At an earlier hearing Howell (pictured, left, in her mug shot), 27, was jailed for 25 years after admitting felony murder and child abuse in relation to Ashlynn's death. Right, Prince in a previous mug shot . During an interview with police, Prince, who had been dating Howell for around five months, reportedly told officers he had become frustrated with the baby because she wouldn't stop crying. Howell, who was apparently sleeping at the time, pleaded guilty in January to her involvement in her daughter's death. She also has two older children, a boy and a girl, St Charles Patch reported. Shockingly, court documents said she had sent a series of text messages to her boyfriend - when Ashlynn was just one month old - encouraging him to have sexual contact with her baby daughter. Prince  - who is not Ashlynn's father and was previously convicted in 2007 of lewd conduct with a minor under the age of 16 - will be sentenced by Circuit Judge Nancy Schneider on April 30.

All article text:Within hours of a white officer shooting an unarmed black man, the police chief of Wisconsin's capital city was praying with the man's grandmother, hoping to strike a conciliatory tone and avoid the riots that last year rocked Ferguson, Missouri. Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps.' 'Folks are angry, resentful, mistrustful, disappointed, shocked, chagrined. I get that,' Koval said Saturday. 'People need to tell me squarely how upset they are with the Madison Police Department.' Scroll down for video . Chief Mike Koval said he knows Madison is being watched across the nation since 19-year-old Tony Robinson's death on Friday evening, and he has gone out of his way to avoid what he once called Ferguson's 'missteps' The contrasts with Ferguson are many. While Ferguson police initially gave little information about the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old, unarmed black man, Koval rushed to the home of Robinson's mother. She didn't want to meet with him, he said, but he talked and prayed with Robinson's grandmother in the driveway for 45 minutes. It took a week for Ferguson to release the name of the officer who shot Brown. Koval announced the name of the officer involved in Madison, Matt Kenny, the day after the shooting. He volunteered to reporters that the officer had been in a previous fatal shooting in 2007, and that he had been cleared of wrongdoing. On the day that Ferguson police named the officer who shot Brown, they also released video showing what they said was Brown robbing a store. Tony Robinson, an unarmed black 19-year-old, was fatally shot Friday, by Matt Kenny, a white police officer, the Madison police chief said Saturday . When Koval was asked about Robinson's past criminal record Saturday, he declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate to do so a day after the man died. 'We have a police chief who genuinely feels for a family's loss. It should be abundantly clear to anyone following this incident that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,' said Jim Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the state's largest police union. But the chief's measured approach hasn't impressed some demonstrators. Koval angered some of them earlier this year with a blog post demanding they stop blaming police for their problems. 'There are no apologies that can repair the loss or deal with the loss of (Robinson),' said Brandi Grayson, an organizer with Young, Gifted and Black, a Madison group that has demonstrated against what it says is mistreatment of blacks by the justice system. 'This was bound to happen. There's nothing the chief can say short of changing the system.' People gather outside the house where Tony Robinson was shot during a rally on Saturday to protest his death . Robinson died on Friday night after Kenny shot him in an apartment during a confrontation. Kenny had responded to a call of a man jumping in and out of traffic. Kenny forced his way into the apartment after hearing what Koval described as a 'disturbance.' The state Justice Department's Division of Criminal Investigation has taken over the investigation under a new state law passed last year that requires an outside agency to lead probes of officer-involved shootings. DOJ spokeswoman Anne Schwartz declined to comment on Sunday. The shooting comes against a backdrop of multiple instances of white police officers killing unarmed black men around the country over the last year. The highest-profile incident was the death of Brown in Ferguson last August. Days of violence ensued, marked by looting, fires, police firing tear gas into a crowd and officers pointing weapons at demonstrators. Another round of riots broke out in November after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot Brown, Darren Wilson. While Robinson's mom didn't want to meet with him, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval talked and prayed with the dead man's grandmother for 45 minutes . Relatives and friends of Tony Robinson exit a gathering of church representatives, community leaders and residents at Fountain of Life Covenant Church, Saturday, in Madison, Wis. Last week the U.S. Justice Department declined to charge Wilson with civil rights violations but issued a scathing report accusing the Ferguson police department of racism and using policing to fund the city's budget. Koval, who is white, took over as Madison's chief in April, replacing retiring black Chief Noble Wray. In September he told the Wisconsin State Journal he believed his department could deal with a racially charged shooting better than Ferguson, saying his agency is more diverse and more invested in the community than Ferguson's 'rent-a-cops.' 'I see in Ferguson a series of missteps and miscues where they're always reacting and, in fact, over-reacting to every set of facts that is thrown in their midst, frankly,' Koval said in the interview. Two months ago, Koval wrote a blog post criticizing Young, Black and Gifted for blaming his officers for 'everything from male pattern baldness to global warming.' The entry came in response to the group staging protests over officer-involved deaths during rush-hour traffic, demanding jail officials release 350 black inmates and imploring police to stay out of black neighborhoods. Koval tried to be diplomatic when asked about the post on Saturday, saying he and the group have agreed to disagree on policing black neighborhoods. Grayson said Koval has had plenty of time to prepare for a racially charged shooting after watching what unfolded in Ferguson. 'He had a perfect response — perfect for white people,' she said. People look on during a rally protesting the shooting death of Tony Robinson, who was fatally shot on Friday by Matt Kenny, a white police officer .

All article text:Nick Gordon, the troubled fiancé of Bobby Kristina Brown, has defended himself against allegations that Whitney Houston’s daughter was the victim of foul play, Daily Mail Online can reveal. Speaking to Dr Phil McGraw Gordon, 25, said: ‘I lost the most legendary singer ever and I’m scared to lose Krissy. I want to let all you guys know I did everything possible in the world to protect them.’ Gordon’s impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by Dr Phil last week and due to air today. Weeping and wailing and at times incoherent, Gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by Dr Phil. Gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story. He has felt ‘vilified’ and ‘depicted as a monster’ since January 31 when Bobby Kristina, 22, was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub at the Roswell , Georgia home he and Bobby Kristina shared. Scroll down for video . Breakdown: With his mother, Michelle, by his side Nick Gordon struggles to stay coherent . Troubling preview: A trailer for the interview of Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend Nick Gordon by Dr Phil McGraw was released Sunday night. Swinging from crying  to flying into a rage, the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by Dr Phil . But on learning of Gordon’s emotional, mental and physical state Dr Phil could not ‘in good conscience’ go on with the interview. According to Gordon’s mother, Michelle, who was by her son’s side during the highly emotional intervention, ‘Nicholas is at a breaking point. He cannot bear not being without Krissy, by her side. He’s dealing with it by drinking. I’ve begged him to stop.’ Dr Phil told Gordon, who admitted to having taken Xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting: ‘Nick, you’re out of control. You’ve threatened suicide. You deserved to get some help because if you don’t, you know you’re going to wind up dead.’ He added: ‘You’ve got to get yourself cleaned up. You got to man up and straighten up.’ Yesterday DailyMail.com revealed that, barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with Dr Phil, Gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk. The disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by Dr Phil as ‘exponential.’ In the show, due to broadcast Wednesday, a weeping and wailing Gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed: ‘I’m so sorry for everything.’ Asked if he still intended to kill himself he said: ‘If anything happens to Krissi I will.’ He said: ‘My pain is horrible. My heart hurts. I have panic attacks.’ In recent weeks Gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of Xanax, alcohol and prescription sleeping pills. Gordon had agreed to meet with Dr Phil believing that he was there to be interviewed. According to Dr Phil: 'He felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster.' Instead, on learning of Gordon's rapidly deteriorating mental, emotional and physical state, the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab. Dr Phil stated: 'I don't think he has any chance of turning this round. Left to his own devices he will be dead within the week.' Gordon's mother, Michelle, was by her son's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive – at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed. She described her son as 'at breaking point.' She said: 'He cannot take too much more of not being able to see Kriss. He blames himself. He's torn up and carrying guilt. 'He's dealing with it by drinking. I've begged him to stop. I've tried to help him but he can't let go of the guilt.' Leaning towards Gordon's mother, Dr Phil said: 'You and I have one mission with one possible outcome and that's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression, his guilt…and to get clean and sober.' He added: 'His life absolutely hangs in the balance.' Questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of January 31st that led to Bobbi Kristina, 22, ending up face down in her tub. Just two days ago Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Leolah Brown, made a series of explosive Facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had 'strong evidene of foul play' relating to Gordon's role in events. She posted: 'Nick Gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate! Especially to my family. Moreover, he has done things to my niece that I never thought he had in him to do!' Leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto Dr Phil's show. Tough to watch: The young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . In her message she wrote: 'With all due respect, Nick Gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece….We have strong evidence of foul play.' Marks were found on her face and arms, marks that Gordon has explained as the result of CPR which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived. And speaking to Dr Phil, Gordon insisted: 'I did everything possible in the world to protect them [Whitney and Bobbi Kristina].' Railing against the decision by Bobbi's father, Bobby Brown, to ban him from his fiancée's bedside at Atlanta's Emory Hospital, Gordon said: 'My name will be the first she calls.' According to his mother, Michelle, Gordon cannot forgive himself for his 'failure' to revive Bobbi Kristina. His guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier. 'I hate Bobby Brown!' His tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend's father Bobby Brown, who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . 'Are you drinking?' The emotional man's anger only increases as Dr. Phil asks about Nick's sobriety . Refuses to go: The 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . Resigned: Ultimately, Gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . Then, on 11 February 2012, it was Gordon who tried to resuscitate Whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a Grammy awards party. Speaking to Dr Phil, Michelle said: 'Nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed Whitney. 'He administered CPR [to Whitney] and he called me when he was standing over her body. He couldn't understand why he couldn't revive her. He said, "Mommy why? I couldn't get the air into her lungs." Gordon has now entered a rehab facility in Atlanta. Meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma. It is now six weeks since Bobbi Kristina – Krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with Gordon in Roswell, Georgia. Unlike Whitney's death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Nick, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. In an interview with The Sun  a friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone. Sounding eerily similar to Bobbi's mother and father's drug-dependent relationship, the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on. 'Bobbi and Nick would spend a lot on drugs every day, it just depended on how much money they had. It wasn't unusual for them to spend $1,000 a day on drugs. 'There were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours, just lying there on the bed. There were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice. She was always covered in cigarette burns.' Their relationship was also very volatile. 'When Whitney died Nick was left with nothing, so he knew he had to control Krissi to get access to the money. She'd do whatever he told her. 'He was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her. They would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around.' According to Stepho: 'But Krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother. She was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her. Nick knew this and took advantage of it.' Troubled relationship: A friend of the couple, Steven Stepho, claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin, Xanax, pot and heroin substitute Roxicodone .

Oggy and the Cockroaches is a French animated comedy series produced by Xilam and Gaumont Film Company and which airs on the Nickelodeon children's TV cartoon channel NickToons. But the comedy has caused fury among some parents after an episode showed a framed picture of a topless lady showing off her assets. Scroll down for video . An episode of popular children's TV show Oggy and the Cockroaches has been pulled from the air after angry parents complained about this scene (pictured) which shows a topless woman in a picture in the  background . The busty topless cartoon character - who appears to be a duck  blessed with an enormous bosom - was in the background of an episode which aired in the US on March 5. She also sports a pair of tiny bikini briefs, giant sunglasses and a bouffant hair-do. The NickToons US website now appears to have removed the show from both its schedule and the show's homepage, although some character's 'profile pages' remain live. But TV schedules for the next few days show other episodes are still billed to air in the US. NickToons UK and Ireland began airing the show in September last year and shows new episodes every weekend morning. It is unclear if the show will also be removed from the air in Britain. Nickelodeon's US website now appears to have removed the show from both its schedule and the show's homepage, although some pages remain live . One father told TMZ his child spotted the pair of breasts on his faourite show and was 'extremely unhappy' about it - particularly has he was forced to have an chat about anatomy with his 8-year-old son. MailOnline has contacted Nickelodeon and Xilam for a comment. Many viewers have taken to social media to discuss 'boobgate'. Hedda G wrote: 'Of course the image was inappropriate. That being said an eight year old boy is in 3rd grade. He should know about breasts. The little guy should have a basic understanding.' Christine added: 'Cartoonists have been doing this c*** for ages especially Disney. Parents still take their kids to Disney cartoons. Other things to worry about people.' Megan Mayhew wrote on Facebook: 'Ok so it's ok for women to breastfeed in public but a cartoon of boobs is horrible. If an eight year old has never noticed women have boobs than I'm glad his dad had a talk with him. Stop making the naked body so taboo.' Selina Fraley said: 'Wait so the father was concerned about the boobs in the background but not the filth that his kids was watching I mean, the characters were poisoning each other and lit eachother on fire! But you're worried about cartoon breasts smh get your priorities straight.'

All article text:A weasel proved that it is more of a handful than a mouse when it prevented its owner from playing on his computer. Recording the encounter at home, the video maker waits poised with his hand on the computer mouse as the little mammal named Ozzy watches. After flicking his thumb a few times he gets the weasel’s attention and invites the onslaught from his cute and cuddly attacker. The intrigued weasel comes over to its owner after he twiddles his thumb in the hope of getting its attention . Diving at his thumb, the weasel rolls underneath it and begins nibbling on it as it curls itself up into a ball. Before retreating, looking around and repeating the process – this time clinging on to the thumb. Spinning onto its back, Ozzy casually looks at the camera and bares its teeth before flipping back onto all fours with great agility and attacking the man’s hand once more. Seconds out, round one! The weasel feels out its opponent's thumb before springing into action . Retreating behind the computer’s speaker, the weasel runs back and forward in between its rough-and-tumble. Before momentarily choosing to ignore the thumb and come right up to the camera to stare down its lens curiously. After more of the same, Ozzy runs off behind the keyboard and the video maker is left twiddling his fingers. The cute and cuddly attacker rolls onto its back while enjoying some rough-and-tumble with its owner . According to the owner, the weasel is fully grown and always in the mood for fun and games. But, writing on his YouTube channel, he also noted that weasel’s should not be considered pets. He wrote: ‘They hate being locked up, they're not friendly when hungry. Don't get one. Seriously. Ozzy is a special case rescue baby. Cute, but deadly.’ Rolling onto its back, the weasel takes a break from fighting to look down the camera and bare its teeth . The least weasel, as Ozzy's type is known, is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa, though it has been introduced elsewhere. Despite the mammal’s small size, it has the capability of killing a rabbit five to ten times its own weight. And a mouse (and a thumb) is clearly no match for it either. The adorable animal has become so popular on YouTube, its owner has even set up a Facebook page in honour of Ozzy The Weasel, complete with videos, pictures and updates. The weasel called Ozzy latches onto its owner's thumb and begins giving it a little nibble .

Thomas Lavery and Krystine Hall, who are both believed to work at Apple, were walking through New Haven on Sunday when they spotted firefighters tackling a raging fire outside a restaurant.

Mr Lavery and Ms Hall then burst into fits of laughter after the latter realizes her colleague is taking a video, not a photo. Mr Lavery then tells her: 'I just wanted to see them [the firefighters] get it out.' He goes on to say, 'here we go', as a firefighter picks up a water hose and aims it at the blaze. But seconds later, his words are drowned out as the stream of water strikes the pair on the head.

The former Manchester United and Everton manager is upset that his selected 11 appeared in the media last weekend before his team’s Sunday lunchtime game against Valenica. In a press conference on Friday he said: ‘For some reason our team is in the newspapers [on the day of the game]. I don’t get the opposition team. I didn’t get Valencia’s team but the opposition get my team. I don’t think that’s right. Real Sociedad's starting XI was leaked to local media ahead of their match against Valencia . David Moyes promised to find the person responsible for the leak and remove them from the club . ‘It doesn’t seem correct to me that our rivals find about our team selection because of leaks.’ When asked if a story circulating in San Sebastian that he has warned the players that if he finds one of his team has been leaking the team to the press he will make sure they leave the club, he replied: ‘Yes, correct!’ Moyes made several changes when he arrived at the Basque club last November, reducing the number of public training sessions in the lead up to match days and limiting daily injury updates because he believes it helps inform rivals. Real Sociedad midfielder Sergio Canales battles during the 2-0 defeat by Valencia last weekend . Valencia manager Nuno Espirito Santo had the advantage of knowing Sociedad's team in advance . He also prefers not to announce the squad for games on the Friday before a match – something that has not gone down well with some local reporters. Real Sociedad face Espanyol on Saturday. Moyes said: ‘They have been in good form recently. But I hope we can use our good recent form at home.'
