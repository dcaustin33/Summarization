The non swimmer was at the centre of a rescue operation after he was spotted waist deep in the murky water with his hands wrapped around the mast. The Vauxhall Corsa ended up nearly fully submerged in the pond after the driver slewed off the road, when he collided with a parked car to avoid a deer. This is the moment the hapless motorist was found clinging to his car aerial after plunging into a garden pond . Police, fire fighters and paramedics were dispatched to bizarre scene in Rumburgh, Suffolk, after the alarm was raised at around 3am. Fire crews used an extendable ladder to rescue the man from the roof of his car before the damaged Corsa was hauled out of the water. 'I didn't hear much as I was fast asleep, but then there were three fire engines, the ambulance and the police outside my house,' said Roger Davis, 59, whose pond was at the centre of the rescue. 'The chap was clinging to the roof of the car, they got him off and pulled the car out. He couldn't swim - and the pond is about 12 foot deep at the moment. 'I think the chap went to hospital with hypothermia, he was clinging to the roof and holding on to the car's aerial. It was interesting to say the least. 'I think he'd swerved to avoid a deer, that's what the police said.' Fire crews used an extending ladder to assist the unnamed motorist getting back to dry land . The blue coloured Vauxhall Corsa was left almost fully submerged after the early morning accident . After the driver was rescued the mangled wreckage of the car was hauled from the water by a tow truck . The man was breathalyzed by police at the scene, but he gave a negative test for alcohol. Stuart Hostler, watch commander at Halesworth fire station, said: 'He was a very lucky chap. 'When we got there he had already got out of the car and was holding on to the aerial for dear life. 'He was showing signs that he was very cold and he was up to his waist in the water.' The East of England Ambulance Service said the man was conscious and alert when they arrived.

All article text:An investigation has revealed how factory workers in China risk contracting a potentially fatal disease to produce jeans for fashion labels Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters. Employees at a factory where the two companies source their products were filmed using a method known as sandblasting - which gives the material a fashionable faded look. The practice is known to be dangerous and has been banned in some countries after being linked to deaths from respiratory disease silicosis. Dangerous method: Secret footage taken during an undercover investigation shows workers in Chinese factory which supplies Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters continue to use sandblasting . The short programme, titled 'Denim Blues' and due to be aired on Al Jazeera on March 19, also exposed poor working conditions and environmental damage resulting from the industry in the Chinese city of Xintang, known as the jeans capital of the world. The video, shot by an undercover researcher, captured employees working at a frantic pace in a factory known as Dongguan Tiangxiang. Chemicals lie haphazardly around the room and workers use a potent chemical called potassium permanganate without wearing proper protective masks. The secret footage also shows sandblasting going on in the factory and the labels of American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister, owned by A&F, are clearly visible. Secret footage: In the short film, an undercover researcher discovers an Abercrombie & Fitch label at a factory where jeans are being sandblasted . Part of initiative: American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) jeans are also seen in the footage. The company joined an initiative in 2011 to help boycott the practice . In 2011, AEO joined an initiative spearheaded by Levi and H&M  to boycott the controversial production method known as sandblasting. In a company statement, the popular brand said: 'Until we believe that proper controls can be put in place to ensure sandblasting is done safely, we are no longer developing new styles with sandblasting.' Jeans with a distressed, already-worn appearance have been popular since the 1990s and method to create the effect is by blasting them with sand. Manual sandblasting of jeans requires only a hose, an air compressor and sand - workers literally blast the material with sand to give them a faded look and to soften the denim. Constant exposure to minute particles used in the process can lead to accidental inhalation, and later respiratory disease silicosis. Silicosis is caused when small particles of silica dust from the sand embed themselves within the lungs. The incurable disease causes shortness of breath, coughing, weakness and weight loss and in its acute form is fatal. When asked by investigators about their supplier's continued use of the practice, they claimed the sandblasting facilities had been removed but did not say when. A spokesman said: 'AEO has thoroughly investigated the factory Dongguan Tim Cheung (here referred to as Dongguan Tianxiang) and has verified that all sandblasting equipment has been removed from the factory.' Abercrombie & Fitch also appeared to dispute the evidence, claiming: 'Yes Dongguan Tiangxiang produces goods for us. We don't allow vendors to use sandblasting during the manufacturing process of our goods.' On their website the world-famous brand says: '[We are] proud of our commitment to international human and labor rights, and to ensuring that our products are only made in safe and responsible facilities. 'We partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilizing the best practices in human rights, labor rights and workplace safety. 'Abercrombie & Fitch believes that business should only be conducted with honesty and respect for the dignity and rights of all people. Health risk: A bucket of chemicals lies exposed in the Dongguan Tianxiang factory, where AEO and Abercrombie & Fitch source their jeans . Dirty environment: The footage shows how working conditions in the factory are a long way from what Abercrombie & Fitch customers might imagine . Employees at a factory where Abercrombie & Fitch and AEO source their products were filmed using a method known as sandblasting - which gives the material a fashionable faded look . Sandblasting is dangerous as constant exposure to minute particles in the process  can lead to silicosis. In 2009, Turkey banned the process after hundreds of former workers were diagnosed with the disease. Dozens of others have died. The method is still legal in China and some workers run mobile sandblasting services travelling between factories - and they  are paid around 4p for each pair of jeans. Factory managers refused to discuss the process, but workers speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed the controversial practice continues. One worker told Al Jazeera: 'The main problem with sandblasting is the dust. This means you risk getting silicosis if you are not properly protected.' Some workers say they suffer not only from lung problems but also from allergies caused by dyes and other chemicals used in the making of denim. Al Jazeera will be airing the show on Thursday March 19.

All article text:Militant union boss Len McCluskey has warned that his activists will break the law if the Tories curb the right to strike after the election. In an extraordinary move, which was condemned by ministers, the Unite general-secretary said he was seeking to change the giant union’s constitution to authorise illegal action. Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Ed Miliband more than £14 million, said union members could not be expected to obey ‘oppressive’ laws that restrict the right to strike. Unite general-secretary Len McCluskey said he was seeking to change the giant union’s constitution to authorise illegal action . The Conservatives have said they will change the law to require unions to get the support of at least 40 per cent of their members before calling a strike. The initiative is designed to prevent union bosses ordering strikes on the basis of ballots in which only a tiny number of members have voted. Mr McCluskey said the right to strike was already ‘hanging by a thread’ as a result of union reforms carried out by the Coalition. In a move that suggests he has little confidence in a Labour victory, Mr McCluskey said Unite members would now be asked to vote to remove the words ‘so far as may be lawful’ from the rules governing the union's actions. In a speech to lawyers, Mr Cluskey said: ‘These words will go not because we are anarchists, not because we are suddenly planning a bank robbery - but because we have to ask ourselves the question, can we any longer make that commitment to, under any and all circumstances, stick within the law as it stands? Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Ed Miliband more than £14 million . ‘It is no exaggeration to say that the right to strike in this - the first country of free trade unionism - was and is hanging by a thread. ‘But should there be a Conservative majority in May, there will be a new attack on trade union rights and democracy. ‘The bar for a strike ballot will be raised to a level which hardly any MPs would get over in their own constituencies, by a government which has refused our requests to use modern, more effective balloting methods. ‘When the law is misguided, when it oppresses the people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question. I'm giving you the answer. It ain't going to happen.’ Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude condemned the move – and said it would raise further concerns Unite’s planned ‘merger’ with the PCS union. Mr Maude said: ‘Labour's biggest donor and Ed Miliband's puppet master is now advocating that their membership break the law. Ed Miliband needs to immediately condemn this outrageous proposal and refuse to take a penny more from Unite until these plans are cancelled.’ Tory MP Dominc Raab said it was ‘shocking’ for a union leader to call for illegal action – and called on Mr Miliband to disown the move. Mr Raab, who has campaigned for the introduction of minimum strike thresholds, said: ‘Red Len has never managed to persuade even a quarter of Unite members to back even one of his reckless public sector strikes since 2010, but it's still shocking to hear him preparing to break the law. Ed Miliband has taken millions from this union bully since becoming Labour leader, so if he now fails to condemn this threat of illegal strikes, it will just show the public what a weak leader he is.’ Unite activists will decide on the change of wording to the union's rules at a conference later in the year. The Labour Party declined to comment.

All article text:(CNN)"Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero." It was a routine sign-off, an all-is-well. On March 8, 2014, at 1:19 a.m., someone spoke those last words from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 to air traffic controllers before the Boeing 777 vanished. A year later, searchers have no new clues as to where it went with 239 people on board. Radar and satellite reports have provided hints, but searchers still have nothing to hold in their hands. No wreckage seen floating at sea or beached on shore. No fuselage resting on the sea floor. Experts have said the data indicate the flight path from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing unexpectedly veered, putting the commercial jet over the southern Indian Ocean. But the water's vast and intricate depths have revealed no secrets. And as clarity has eluded grasp, analysts have made many speculations about what happened. The most controversial idea: Is the maritime search area all wrong? Did the plane land clandestinely on solid ground? Here are some expert theories about what happened to MH370. Investigators have since cast doubt on some of their details. Who radioed those last words to air traffic control? Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah? First officer Fariq Abdul Hamid? There was much speculation over that, but the Malaysian inspectors in April said it was Zaharie. The pilots were supposed to check in with new air traffic controllers in Vietnam, but never did. One theory is that one pilot may have incapacitated the other, then guided the plane to its end, taking the passengers down with him in a dramatic suicide. Mark Weiss, a retired American Airlines captain, has flown a Boeing 777. He believed shortly after the crash that there may have been a struggle. "It was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane," he said. But Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya has vehemently defended his employees, particularly the pilot. "We do not suspect any one of our crew until there's such evidence. ... Captain Zaharie is a very capable man," he said. "We have no reason to suspect (him)." Weiss also thought there could have been another person -- a crew member or someone else -- in the cockpit who "was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft." Copilot Hamid, 27, reportedly once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit on a 2011 flight between Thailand and Malaysia. "That's an enormous breach of security," Weiss said. But investigators punched holes in the idea, saying there was no indication of a third party in the cockpit, CNN reported in April. The difference between hijacking and commandeering is nuanced. The former term is often used when the hijacker issues a demand such as being taken to a safe-haven country or receiving ransom to release passengers. When people commandeer a plane, they might keep the motives secret, said political analyst Peter Bergen. They may want to steer it themselves at a target, like the September 11, 2001, terrorists did. In 1994, a FedEx employee burst into the cockpit of FedEx Flight 705 with a hammer and spear gun. He wanted to crash the plane into the company's Memphis, Tennessee, headquarters. The crew thwarted that takeover. "Commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know, and (it's) certainly a theory that we haven't heard a lot of that isn't a conspiracy," Bergen said. Experts are divided on this theory, partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something. MH370 went to Kazakhstan. Outlandish conjecture or genius insight? The theory that Russian actors on board MH370 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of China, Pakistan and India to a Kazakh landing strip leased to Russia comes from science journalist and private pilot Jeff Wise. Fleets of ships and search aircraft are looking in the wrong direction, he says. The airliner went north, not south. Investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the Inmarsat satellite data. "This is not a normal investigation. They need to throw out the book," Wise has said. Another aviation analyst, David Soucie, also cast doubt after MH370 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the Indian Ocean. "If it had crashed in the way that we think it did, which is to run out of fuel and hit the water and break up into pieces, there would be pieces somewhere," he said. But Michael Exner, an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry, says the data "accurately and unambiguously" shows MH370 went down near the so-called 7th arc, a path along which the search has been focused. "The current ATSB search strategy remains the best search strategy," he said. In a less sinister but equally lethal explanation, some experts theorized the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction. Perhaps the electronics died, or a fire broke out, preventing the pilots from communicating. Maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but couldn't steer the plane properly. Pilots had trouble embracing the thought. "I've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened," said Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and retired American Airlines pilot. "One possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very, very hard to imagine because (the plane) has so many generators coming from different places," Tilmon said. If they fail, there are other backups. He has said he's never heard of anything like it happening before. For months after MH370 disappeared, Malaysian officials reported details of the search to next of kin and the public. Something would be spotted, hopes rose, and then it didn't pan out. Hopes were dashed; anguish returned. Sunday, a year to the day after the plane disappeared, the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of MH370. It found no indications of unusual behavior among the aircraft's pilots and cabin crew before it took off, and said that Zaharie had had no personal or financial problems that would cast suspicion on him. The interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance. The battery on the plane's other so-called black box, the cockpit voice recorder, had been replaced as scheduled, and remained within its expiry date, the report said. CNN's Pamela Boykoff and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

All article text:For three long years Claire O’Meara put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing. Long hours spent at her computer, plus business trips abroad were surely responsible for triggering the searing headaches that made it feel as though her head was being gripped in a vice. ‘I was 30 when the migraines began, randomly at first, but then they came every month,’ says Claire, 35, who lives in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, with her husband Brendan, 42, a fitness centre owner. ‘I blamed my career and lifestyle. At work, I’d have to sit in a dark room and shut my eyes as the pain was all-consuming. Sometimes, the migraines would wipe me out for a week. Claire O’Meara (pictured) used to put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing . ‘Despite being a virtual workaholic, there were times I was unable to function and would have to phone in sick, which left me feeling terribly guilty.’ Things got so bad that last year Claire gave up her job to work part-time for her husband, helping to market his firm. But then Claire had an epiphany when she began keeping a diary of her headaches — her migraines were linked to her menstrual cycle. ‘I noticed they always came the day before my period, and it was a relief to finally realise what the trigger was. ‘It altered the way I tried to deal with them. I took advice, mapped out my cycles, and upped my dosage of magnesium (said to regulate hormones) and took over-the-counter drug Migraleve to try to prevent a migraine coming on 24 hours before I knew my period was due. This has staved off a full-blown migraine for the last few months.’ Claire is not the only woman suffering from this commonly misdiagnosed side-effect of the menstrual cycle. Claire (pictured after a migraine) gave up her job to work part-time for her husband last year when the migraines got really bad . According to charity the National Migraine Centre, a staggering 50 per cent of women suffer menstrual migraines immediately before, during or just after their period. But, like Claire, very many don’t make the connection between the two for years — and neither do their GPs. Online forums are awash with women discussing the ‘lightbulb moment’ they finally realised their cycle was to blame. Although migraines are an age-old problem, the diagnosis of specific menstrual migraines is a modern phenomenon, following extensive research over the past 25 years. Professor Anne MacGregor, a leading specialist in headaches and women’s health, says: ‘The most common cause is a drop in oestrogen towards the end of the cycle. This hormone is released at the start of it, and levels rise, eventually triggering ovulation and an egg’s release. Claire (pictured) has seen various GPs and doctors about her severe migraines but none have been able to come up with a treatment that has worked completely . ‘Progesterone is released and prepares the womb lining for a fertilised egg. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, both levels drop and cause a period. ‘It’s this sudden drop that triggers a migraine as the body deals with the hormone withdrawal.’ She says hormones used in contraceptives, such as the Pill, coil and patch put all women of menstruating age at risk — but those in their 30s and 40s more so. ‘This is because hormone levels fluctuate more in the years building up to the menopause, mean ing the drop in oestrogen and therefore withdrawal symptoms are greater,’ she reveals. ‘Traditional headache remedies don’t work. This is why we’d like to see greater diagnosis, so women can get the right treatment.’ Claire’s work was not the only thing that suffered. She often found herself saying to Brendan: ‘Not tonight, darling, I’ve a headache’ — and meaning it. ‘Thank goodness he’s very understanding,’ she says. Her social life was often wrecked, too: ‘I’ve had to regularly cancel social engagements, including a close friend’s baby shower.’ Claire saw various doctors: her GP, another for a second opinion, plus a consultant — but none came up with a treatment that worked completely. ‘All they suggested was that I take Migraleve, but until I started taking it as a preventative measure it did nothing to help me.’ Dr Jud Pearson, at the National Migraine Centre, advises patients who suspect their headaches may be menstruation-related to start keeping a diary like Claire. ‘I think women have always suspected they have menstrual migraines but doctors have not always believed them until now. ‘Now, however, there is a growing awareness of the condition, which means more women are finally being diagnosed.’ Marie Brown 47, a dental company sales consultant living in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has had migraines for more than a decade, but only found out two years ago they were linked to her menstrual cycle, thanks to the migraine diary she was keeping. Marie Brown, 47, (pictured) has also suffered from severe migraines for more than ten years but only discovered two years ago that they are related to her periods . She reveals: ‘The first migraine I suffered was in my late 30s, and even going from bed to bathroom caused agonising pain in my head. There were times I wondered whether the headaches were a symptom of something horribly sinister, such as a brain tumour.’ Only when the migraines became a monthly occurrence, at age 44, did Marie made the connection. She now has a supply of the migraine drug Sumatriptan on hand to take on her ‘danger’ days to prevent attacks. ‘It was such a relief to finally find something that worked for me. But if I don’t take a tablet in time, the ensuing migraine is hell.’ Even with the medication, she still plans her social life and work meetings around her periods. ‘I deliberately don’t book anything for the week of my period, as on so many occasions I’ve had to bolt when a migraine has started. Marie (seen here age 27) uses medication to combat the headaches but still has to plan her social life and meetings around her periods . ‘Last New Year’s Eve I had to abandon dinner with my partner and go to bed at 10pm, when one came on. ‘Unlike most women, I’m actually longing for the menopause in the hope that once my periods stop, so too will the migraines.’ For Sarah Rose, 31, a special educational needs support assistant who lives in Croydon, Surrey, with partner Paul, 33, a sales manager, and their son Jack, two, the severity of monthly menstrual migraines was so great last Easter that her GP sent her to A&E fearing she had a bleed on the brain. ‘I spent five days in hospital on morphine. A CT scan ruled out anything sinister, but I had felt as though my head would literally explode. It was so frightening, all I could think was my lovely little boy needs his mummy and what if something serious was happening to me?’ Marie (pictured) suffered her first migraine in her late 30s, but they became a monthly occurrence when she reached 44, at which point Marie connected the pain to her menstrual cycle . However, unlike many other women, Sarah has suffered from menstrual migraines for all of the years of her adult life. ‘I first had the headaches at school but blamed exam stress for them. They worsened at university and my GP sent me to a neurologist. ‘He diagnosed migraines, but didn’t link them to my cycle. ‘It wasn’t until I was talking to my great aunt, now in her 80s five years ago, that I realised the cause. She said she used to suffer terrible migraines during her period and suspected this was my problem, too. ‘After that, I used the Period Tracker Deluxe mobile phone app to record my symptoms and periods and, sure enough, a pattern soon emerged. ‘Subsequently I also tried homeopathy, specifically a herbal remedy called sepia, which is supposed to help problems associated with your period problems.’ Sarah is an extreme case. But, for many women, the stark facts are that a migraine is another monthly misery they have to endure.

Iran faces a March 24 deadline to reach a deal about its nuclear program. Several interim agreements have been made in recent months, though a long-term pact so far has been elusive. Speaking in Paris alongside French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, Kerry said progress has been made "but there remain gaps, divergences." He acknowledged "the days are ticking by," but that doesn't mean there's an urgent rush to reach an agreement. "We have to get the right deal," the top U.S. diplomat said. Kerry said one thing all members of the P5+1 group -- which consists of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, plus Germany -- agree on is that it's imperative Iran doesn't develop nuclear arms. Iranian minister: Some consider peace an 'existential threat' Officials in Tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes, not to create atomic weaponry. "We will find out whether or not ... Iran's prepared to take the steps to answer the questions that the world has a right to get answers to," Kerry said.

Yes, it had to hurt a little that he had glorious opportunities to win the last two events on the PGA Tour and didn't close the deal in either instance. But this is a man who had fallen so far in America he hadn't registered a top-three finish here in five years, let alone two in a row. Now, after becoming the last man to earn a spot in this elite field and on the verge of earning his first invitation to the Masters for three years, it is not surprising the 37-year-old has no trouble dwelling on the positives. England star Paul Casey is standing on the brink of a Masters invitation for the first time in three years . 'I'm fine about not winning because the first thing was to earn loads of world ranking points to get me back into the top 50,' argued Casey, who has moved from 83rd to 45th — his highest ranking since 2012. 'I'm happy on the course, happy off it, and I really think I can build on what I have achieved these past two weeks. There's better golf ahead of me.' Casey has turned his professional life around after making what he describes as 'the hardest decision of my career'. Three months ago he resigned his European Tour membership and woke to headlines proclaiming he had spurned the chance to play in the Ryder Cup, since you have to be a member to make the team. 'I understood the stories and if it hadn't involved me, it's what I would have thought,' he said. 'But I haven't given up on the Ryder Cup. Anything but. My dream is to play in several more but I just haven't figured out how to yet. 'My energy has been focused on getting back in the top 50 because that's where I will be of most use to Europe.' 37-year-old Casey secured a third-place finish at the Honda Classic as he continues his renaissance . Casey was such a European Tour loyalist he served on any number of committees. 'It was such a difficult decision to resign that I took a few months to tell my manager Guy Kinnings because I felt I was betraying him and the Tour,' said Casey. 'But I was running out of second chances. I was going back and forth across the Atlantic and it was clearly affecting my golf. 'Now I feel so relaxed knowing I don't have to run myself ragged. I can't tell you the difference it is making.' Becoming a father has also helped. Golf author Keith Elliott highlighted long ago the positive effects the 'nappy factor' can have on a top pro and Casey is another paid-up subscriber. 'The great thing is I don't take my work home with me any more,' said Casey, who lives with wife Pollyanna and infant son Lex in Arizona. 'I used to hang around the golf course all day at home wasting time but now I'm much more savvy.' The world's top 50 players get invitations at the end of this month to the Masters, so no prizes for guessing the next target for one of Europe's best ball strikers. Ranked world No 3 in 2008, it's exciting to think where this second act might take him. Casey has scaled the world rankings from 83rd up to 45th, his highest placing since 2012 .

Why is it so hard to see black and blue? is the charity's latest advert and highlights the plight of women who are victims of domestic violence. Launched in South Africa today, where one in six women are the victims of abuse at home, it features a model wearing the Roman Originals dress in white and gold. The Salvation Army in South Africa has adopted the dress for its newest campaign against domestic violence . Capitalising on the garment's notoriety, the tag line reads: 'The only illusion is if you think it was her choice. One in 6 women are victims of abuse. Stop abuse against women.' It also carries the logo for Carehaven, a home for abused women and their children. Since being posted this morning the image has been shared thousands of times online. It has been shared thousands of times online, with Twitter users among those to praise the charity's clever adopting of the trend. Twitter users praised the campaign with thousands retweeting the image and sharing their views online . Internet sensation: This picture of the dress sparked debate, with millions disagreeing over the colour . When aspiring singer Caitlin McNeill uploaded a photograph of a dress to her Tumblr blog, the 21-year-old thought it would do little more than serve as a source of light entertainment for friends. But within hours of sharing the image millions of people and the world's rich and famous were discussing its subject. The question on everyone's lips was: is the dress black and blue or white and gold? Celebrities offered their input while memes mocking the debate flurried. Soon #TheDress was the number one hashtag on Twitter and was being poured over by millions. While it was determined once and for all that the dress was indeed black and blue, the company has since produced a limited edition white and gold number. According to scientists the reason so many viewed the dress differently is down to genes, lighting and a person's age. True colours: This photograph of Cecelia Bleasdale in 'the dress', left, with daughter Grace Johnston and son-in-law Keir Johnston, reveals that the frock is royal blue with a black lace trim . 'So clever! Advertising at its best!' was how one user described it while scores of others lauded its 'powerful' message. 'Really like this clever way @SalvationArmySA used #TheDress to send a powerful message' said Hayley Slaughter while Kara Rose described the campaign as 'clever and powerful'. Andrew Blakeley added: 'The best hijacking of the online culture I've seen recently. Bravo to the Salvation Army.' 'The dress debate put to socially good use! I like a lot,' said another. A spokesperson for The Salvation Army said: 'The Salvation Army sees the devastating effects of domestic violence on women, men and children every day. 'We support people who are affected in our human trafficking work, our specialist services, Lifehouses and community centres. 'We know that one in four women are victims of domestic violence in the UK: this innovative and powerful campaign by The Salvation Army in South Africa highlights that domestic violence is often overlooked by society. 'We hope this image helps people to see the true impact of this crime.' 'The dress' sparked global debate last week with millions of people arguing over the colour of its fabric. With celebrities Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber among those to weigh in on what colours they saw, its manufacturer, Roman Originals, suddenly became the world's most talked about brand. The Twitter storm began when a 21-year-old aspiring singer from Scotland posted a photograph of the garment on Tumblr after seeing her friends disagree over its colours. While the original dress is black and blue the company has since produced a limited edition white and gold version to meet demand.

Caterham fell into administration towards the end of October after a dispute between the owners at the time and their predecessor in Tony Fernandes, the current chairman of Barclays Premier League team QPR. A crowd-funding project helped Caterham on to the grid for the final race of last term in Abu Dhabi after they had missed the previous two events in the United States and Brazil. Caterham crashed out of Formula One after hitting financial difficulties . The team was owned by Tony Fernandes, who is currently chairman of Premier League club QPR . Wyles Hardy & Co are selling off Caterham's items via auction over the next three months. Here, Sportsmail picks out three items that are up for sale: . Lot 18: 'Two 2011 Show Front Wheel Rims mounted with PIRELLI Wet Show Tyres' - Current bid, as of Monday afternoon: £200 (Bidding ends March 11, 10:14 GMT) Lot 664: 'A Caterham F1 Fully Functioning Race Car Steering Wheel, as Raced in the 2014 Season' - Current bid, as of Monday afternoon: £1,800 (Bidding ends March 12, 12:16 GMT) Lot 880: 'A Lotus Racing Formula 1 Full Racing Chassis Show Car' - Current bid, as of Monday afternoon: £22,500 (Bidding ends March 12, 15:32 GMT) However, despite then administrator Smith & Williamson doing all they could to put Caterham in the shop window, and conducting talks with numerous interested parties, no deal could be struck. What remains of the team's assets are now due to be sold off via auctions over March, April and May, and conducted by Hertforshire-based Wyles Hardy & Co. The first of the auctions - at the Caterham Sports Centre in Langley - runs for three days this week from Wednesday with the sale of race and pit lane equipment, 2014 chassis show cars, electronics workshop and test equipment. Further auctions include the sale of memorabilia, team clothing, branded goods, archive car panels and components, show car, as well as IT and office equipment. It represents a sad end for a team that entered F1 in 2010 with such high hopes and aspirations, only to endure countless problems along the way.

Designers such as Prada, Tom Ford and Gucci showered catwalks last year in flares, jumpsuits, wide-brimmed hats and wild prints. But the retro revival doesn’t stop at the ankles; summer stilettos have been ditched in favour of towering platforms on almost every High Street in the country. As a top model during the Seventies, I lived in platforms. Bigger was always better, especially because — at 5 ft 8 in — I was a little on the short side for the fashion world. Scroll down for video . As a top model during the Seventies, Jilly Johnson (pictured in early Seventies) spent a lot of time wearing platform shoes . I had to bluff my way through shoots with billowing bell-bottoms and chunky shoes that looked fun, flirty and fabulous. But now, aged 61 and with 11 grandchildren, I’m not sure I can carry them off with such aplomb. Surely thin, slimming lines and elegant shapes are what I’m after rather than weighty clodhoppers? To find out if they can ever be flattering, I put eight pairs through their paces. Kurt Geiger, £130 . Shoes: www.kurtgeiger.com . Completely inappropriate — but I think these are divine. I had a pair of red snakeprint platforms by Terry de Havilland like these more than 40 years ago. Sadly, those days are gone. No one over 30 should attempt these now. At 6 in, they are impossible to walk in, though the colour is fabulous. I’d call these ankle breakers. Height: 6 in . Wearability: 3/10 . Clarks, £150 . Shoes: www.clarks.co.uk . Help! These look like dumb-bells stuck to my feet. They are out of proportion with my legs. I look absurd. Not even wearing these shoes with a delicate dress saves them. No thank you. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 0/10 . Next, £35 . Shoes: www.next.co.uk . These work because the straps are thin and dainty and the heel is not a thick wedge. They would jazz up a tailored suit or little black dress perfectly. I’d buy them in a heartbeat. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 9/10 . Russell & Bromley, £125 . Shoes: www.russellandbromley.co.uk . These are reminiscent of my Seventies ‘peace, love and brown rice’ days. The clog style is not sophisticated enough for a lady in her 60s. I clumped about as though walking on stilts. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 2/10 . Dune, £79 . Shoes: www.dunelondon.com . My absolute favourites: the front platform (about an inch thick) is just enough to boost your height without looking clunky. Orange is a bright and breezy colour for spring and summer. Height: 4.5 in . Wearability: 10/10 . Zara, £49.99 . Shoes: www.zara.com . I know I shouldn’t, but I love these skyscrapers. Forty years ago, I would have practically slept in them. Padded soles and thick ankle straps mean they are surprisingly comfortable. Height: 5 in . Wearability: 6/10 . Topshop, £55 . Shoes: www.topshop.com . From the knees down I look great, but I’m not sure a 61-year-old can get away with these. They are as subtle as a sledgehammer and too cumbersome in heavy looking black. Height: 5½ in . Wearability: 6/10 . Office, £65 . Shoes: www.office.co.uk . One of the sturdiest pair of heels I’ve ever worn. The soft leather and mule style is spot-on Seventies. The open toe is perfect for summer and these are age appropriate, too. Hallelujah! Height: 4 in . Wearability: 10/10 .

The 50-year-old politician admitted it would be ‘curtains for me’ - despite only being elected as Ukip leader for a further four-year term in November. Polls suggest Mr Farage is on course for victory in the crucial Kent seat - but he will have to overturn a Conservative majority of nearly 17 per cent. Scroll down for video . 'Significant' consequences: Nigel Farage said it would be ‘curtains for me’ if he fails to win the South Thanet seat - despite only being elected as Ukip leader for a further four-year term in November . Failing to secure the seat would have ‘significant’ consequences for both him and his party, he wrote in The Purple Revolution, serialised in The Daily Telegraph. He said: ‘The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the Commons would be significant for both myself and the party. ‘It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat.’ Mr Farage stated he felt it would risk the party’s 'credibility' if it had other MPs elected but its leader did not have a seat in Parliament. He said: ‘What credibility would Ukip have in the Commons if others had to enunciate party policy in Parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest? Ukip MPs: Mr Farage had to delay the start of his campaigning in South Thanet after the surprise defections of former Tories Douglas Carswell (left) and Mark Reckless (right), which sparked by-elections . ‘Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No - if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.’ Mr Farage’s party currently has two MPs - the Tory defectors Mark Reckless and Douglas Carswell, who both won by elections for Ukip in Rochester and Strood and Clacton after resigning as Conservative MPs. Separately last night, it emerged that Mr Farage had suggested that children of new immigrants coming to Britain should not immediately be allowed to attend state schools. He said Ukip policy was that immigrants and their dependents would need private education for five years after entering the UK. Mr Farage told The Guardian: ‘I wouldn’t foresee people coming into Britain immediately being allowed to bring children to go through the state system.’

All article text:If you're single and struggling to find a girlfriend, you might want to consider a change of profession. Because a study has found that women are more attracted to men who display heroic traits such as war heroes, successful sportsmen and firemen. However, the study found the opposite wasn't true, and men did not find heroism to be a sexually attractive trait in women. Phwoar: A Study by the University of Southampton says women prefer war heroes. They are also attracted to other heroic professions like being a fireman. However, men prefer women to not be in a heroic profession. 'Only males seem to benefit from displaying heroism,' said Dr Leunissen from the university . The study was carried out by the University of Southampton and published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour. In the research 92 women studying in the UK were presented with hypothetical profiles of the opposite sex, representing varying levels of heroism in different contexts such as warfare, sport and business. They were then asked a series of questions designed to determine how attracted they were to the different profiles. Women were more likely to find a soldier attractive, and were more inclined to date him, if he had been awarded a medal for bravery in combat. Ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male-dominated industries, according to a controversial study. Research by Professor Ann Marie Ryan, a psychologist at Michigan State University, suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to those commonly associated with women. She asked women to apply for leadership roles in male-dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates' suitability. Some of the women were asked to emphasise 'masculine-like' traits such as assertiveness, independence and raw ambition. Others were asked to display more 'feminine traits' - warmth, supportiveness and a nurturing nature. The panel, irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it, decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process. But whether or not a non-decorated soldier had seen combat in a warzone or remained in the UK did not have a statistically significant effect on his attractiveness. Displays of heroism in other fields, such as in sports or in business, also had no effect on how likely women were to find them attractive. In a subsequent experiment by the researchers, 159 women and 181 men studying in Holland took part in a similar exercise to determine their level of sexual attraction to the opposite sex. This time, the soldier profiles displayed various levels of bravery, either in combat or by helping in a natural disaster zone. Again, heroism in combat increased women's levels of sexual attraction towards male soldiers, but heroism in a disaster zone had no impact. Female heroes, both in combat and in disaster zones, were deemed less attractive by men than their non-hero counterparts. 'This provides evidence for the hypothesis that gender differences in intergroup conflict can have an evolutionary origin, as only males seem to benefit from displaying heroism,' said Dr Joost Leunissen, a psychologist at the University of Southampton. 'In light of the physical dangers and reproductive risks involved, participating in intergroup aggression might not generally be a viable reproductive strategy for women. 'Heroism also seems to be a context-specific signal, as it only had an effect on attractiveness in a setting of intergroup conflict. 'Indeed, soldiers who displayed heroism were only considered to be more attractive when this was displayed in a warfare context and not in another situation which is frequently associated with the army - helping during and after natural disasters.' Hot stuff: Being a fireman (stock image shown) was one profession rated as being attractive by women in the study. However, Displays of heroism in other fields, such as in sports or in business, also had no effect on how likely women were to find them attractive . The experiments follow on from a historical analysis undertaken by the research team, which looked at numbers of children fathered by US Medal of Honor recipients in the Second World War compared to the numbers of children fathered by regular veterans. The analysis shows Medal of Honor recipients had an average of 3.18 children, while regular veterans averaged 2.72 children, suggesting decorated war heroes sired more offspring than other veterans. 'Raids, battles, and ambushes in ancestral environments, and wars in modern environments, may provide an arena for men to signal their physical and psychological strengths,' said Dr Leunissen. 'Of course, women may not always witness these heroic acts in person, but such information is likely to be widely communicated within a tribal community, particularly when the actions of male warriors are outstandingly brave.' The study team was made up of researchers from the University of Southampton, UK; University of Giessen, Germany; Technical University of Munich, Germany; and VU University Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

All article text:David Cameron has said that he will remain in Parliament as an MP even if he is forced to leave Downing Street after the election. The Prime Minister said that he 'loves public service' and would continue to serve his constituents even if he is 'hoofed out' of Number 10 in May. In contrast to Tony Blair, who left Parliament when he stopped being prime minister in 2007 and has made a personal fortune, Mr Cameron said he planned to 'stick with' voters in his Witney constituency. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron said he will remain in Parliament as an MP even if he loses the election . Mr Cameron insisted the Conservatives could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament . He said: 'I love serving my constituents, I love public service, I think it's what I care about. It's a vocation for me. 'In the unhappy event I'm not Prime Minister on May 8, the people of West Oxfordshire I hope will stick with me and I'll stick with them.' Asked what he would do if he was no longer Prime Minister in an interview with the website BuzzFeed, Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not going to think about that because I've got 50 days to fight the vital election and want to win re-election. 'I think this Government is doing some good things for our country and I want to keep on doing that. 'It's the country's choice, if they hoof me out and go for the other guy, I'll have to think of something else. But I hope I hope I'll still be a Member of Parliament.' He insisted that the Conservatives could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament. During the online interview, Mr Cameron said he was proud of the 'genuinely ground-breaking' work the Government has done on internet safety and spoke about his own children. He said: 'Now when you set up your account the filters are automatically on. I' ve got three children of primary school age and they get to find out the code on your iPad pretty quickly. 'It is reassuring to know the Government has done some very good things on this. I think having the filters switched on is good.' Mr Cameron said that his children do not have unfettered access to mobile phones. He said: 'My daughter has got an iTouch but everything is quite strictly controlled in terms of screen time and we have the filters on for things like my iPad. 'But this is a conversation every parent in the country is having with their children. What age should they be when they should have a Facebook account and unfettered access to a mobile phone? 'We've got an 11-year-old, a nine-year-old and a four-year-old so we're not at that stage yet.' Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt for the interview with BuzzFeed in central London . Mr Cameron said that he personally has an iPhone 'which is basically for family and friends' and a BlackBerry that he uses for work emails. He said that he was not a user of the popular phone app SnapChat, but he said that he sometimes looked at the messages people send him on Twitter, adding: 'You have got to take the rough with the smooth in this job.' When asked if he ever sneaks out of Downing Street without his security detail, Mr Cameron said: 'No because they are trained killers.' Questioned on the four schoolgirls from east London who are thought to have fled to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State, Mr Cameron said: 'I think they're deeply misguided and potentially joining a criminal organisation that could make them part of a terrorist conspiracy. 'We want to get them back and try to get this radical nonsense out of their heads.' Mr Cameron disclosed that - like Ed Miliband - he has two kitchens in his London home. But the Prime Minister said he had the second kitchen installed in his house in Notting Hill for the benefit of the carers who looked after his disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009. Mr Miliband last week faced accusations that he was out of touch following the disclosure that he had two kitchens after he and his wife Justine were filmed in the smaller of the pair for a BBC interview. Mr Cameron said: 'We actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen, not least because I had a very disabled son, Ivan, and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them as well has for him. 'The point is not whether you have got two kitchens, but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it's your kitchen. That's the issue.' The interview was part of the American website's BuzzFeed Brews series that usually sees people answer questions over a beer. Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt, but he declined an alcoholic drink and instead sipped water during the interview in central London. He told the audience that he was a 'big fan' of popular television series Game of Thrones. BuzzFeed, which is well-known for its list-based articles, has become increasingly popular with young people on both sides of the Atlantic, but Mr Cameron faced embarrassment at a No 10 Christmas drinks party in December last year when he asked a group of the site's writers: 'What is 'the BuzzFeed'?'

All article text:An horrifically burned 12-year-old boy was able to tell police it was his dad who started the fatal house fire that killed him and his nine-year-old brother, an inquest has heard. Salesman Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Paul, 9, and his brother Jack, 12, to the attic with fun-size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital. Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns: 'It was my dad that started the fire' and 'My dad did it on purpose.' The fire, which was started deliberately by Mr Sykes (centre), killed himself along with his nine-year-old son Paul (left) and Jack (right), 12 . Jack (right) and Paul Sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze. Here the two boys are pictured with their mother Claire Throssell . Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries told the boys' tearful mother Claire Throssell: 'Your loss has deeply affected me.' He said she bore no blame for the tragedy and told her: 'You have nothing to blame yourself about.' The inquest heard Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives'. Investigating officer Detective Sargent Stuart Hall said: 'I believe the children were almost lured into the loft by the newly purchased train track and fun-size chocolate bars which had been left there to maintain their attentions.' The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with CAFCASS - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy. He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights. Mr Sykes told his boss Andre Spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the CAFCASS visit was a 'waste of time' and 'they wanted to talk about negatives and didn't want to listen to his agenda'. Mr Spencer said: 'He was a dedicated father. His children were his number one priority. He talked about them to the point that he seemed obsessed and boring.' An inquest into the death of Paul (pictured bottom left and far right) and Jack was carried out today, where a coroner ruled their deaths were the result of an unlawful killing . Claire Throssell's son Jack clung to life in intensive care with his mother (pictured) at his bedside, but died five days later . He felt the access arrangements were 'barbaric' and he mistakenly believed Paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week. 'There's no point living,' he told his boss. Mr Spencer said he then went on: 'If anything did happen would I care for his boys.' CAFCASS family adviser Rona Murphy told the inquest in her dealings with the family Paul did want to see his father but only for a three-hour visit on one day a week. Paul had told her about 'issues of abuse' and described meal times as a 'battleground' because his dad 'wanted him to eat more and everything and he didn't want to.' She did not believe Mr Sykes was taking on board what she was telling him. 'He was saying how can I have any less contact than I already have.' Council social worker Julie Keen said four months before the tragedy she had a referral that Paul didn't want to go home from school and have contact with his father. The boys' heartbroken mother Claire Throssell (pictured at her sons' funeral) told the inquest her two children had 'meant the world' to her . 'Paul said his dad was abusive to him and Jack,' she said. 'It was general physical and emotional abuse. On a skiing trip Paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat.' When Mr Sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife. Mr Sykes, lived in Penistone, South Yorkshire, after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's in nearby Thurlstone. On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account. He spent £600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'. Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, some petrol and posted letters to family and friends and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home. He picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire. The inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him. He took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms. Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him. When the fire crew arrived it appeared Jack had bravely tried to get out of the loft as he was found by the bottom of the ladder. Mourners stand by as the caskets of Jack and Paul are carried from a church during their funeral in October . Mr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'. A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze. Cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs. One of his letters to HSBC Bank said: 'I won't be paying the mortgage any more because I won't be alive.' Det Sgt Hall said numerous statements taken by the police showed he was at a 'particularly low point' in his life over visiting rights to his sons and took the view he would have less access. Specialist fire investigator Michael Mason said the carpet and furniture downstairs were well alight when firefighters arrived. 'The door to the stairs had been wedged to stop anyone coming down and there were chairs behind the front door as if to prevent people coming in,' he said. Two bodies were found in the loft - that of Mr Sykes and his son Paul - and Mr Sykes was declared dead on arrival at hospital. Pictured is the home where Paul Skyes killed his two sons after trapping them in the attic and starting a fire . Petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames. Mr Mason said: 'At some point during the fire the loft hatch was closed and then opened during the fire which allowed a plume of smoke with gases to enter the loft. It was a natural reaction to try and get out.' It emerged that it was Jack who opened the hatch and he was rescued conscious by firefighters but died five days later in hospital from his burns. Mr Sykes and Paul died from inhaling noxious fumes. In her statement, the boys' mother said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.' When asked by the coroner if there was anything she would like to add, she replied: 'There is nothing further I can add other than the guilt I that I carry for what has happened to them.' The coroner recorded a verdict on Monday that Mr Sykes committed suicide. Yesterday the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing. Coroner Dorries said: 'This fire was set deliberately indeed the whole event was carefully planned by Mr Sykes to ensure a catastrophic fire while the boys were distracted by model railway equipment and sweets.'

A married mother-of-two broke down in tears after she was told she could be sent to prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy. Kelly Jane Richards, of South Wales, admitted having sex with the teenager, who is less than half her age. The Jehovah's Witness was arrested last December after the child's mother discovered what had happened. The 36-year-old had originally denied seducing the teen, but pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child. Richards sat in the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, South Wales, and broke down in tears as the charge was read to her. Two elders from the Jehovah's Witness community were sitting at the back of the court to give her support. The court was told Richards 'did not reasonably believe that he was 16 or over' when she had penetrative sex with the schoolboy just two months before his birthday. The offence took place during term time in 2012, the court heard. A second similar charge was left to 'lie on file'. Sarah Waters, defending, told the court Richards was of 'good character'. Judge Richard Twomlow told Richards she would be sentenced later this month. He added that 'all options remain open' - which includes a custodial sentence. He told her: ' You will be sentenced later this month and I am going to ask for a report so the court knows more about you. 'The fact I am asking for a report and granting bail does not give any indication of the sentence I will pass. 'This is a serious matter. 'Obviously I will reserve the matter to myself and all sentencing options remain open to me.' She was shielded going out of the court by her husband. Richards will be sentenced on March 23. Richards was pictured with a hood covering her head arriving at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court this morning . The married mother of two was said to break down in tears after she appeared at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court .
