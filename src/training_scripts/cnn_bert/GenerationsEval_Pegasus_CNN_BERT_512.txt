All article text:A suspected Banksy of a pouting young girl is believed to now be worthless after a vandal painted over it so she is now wearing a burkha. The artwork, which first appeared on the side of the North Star pub in Hounslow, west London, in 2007, was defaced over the weekend. The 6ft tall mural, thought to be worth £100,000, has the word 'smile' in brightly coloured letters written above the girl, originally pictured in pigtails - but now only her eyes remain visible. The Banksy of a pouting young girl in Hounslow, which first appeared in 2007 (left) was defaced over the weekend to show the girl wearing a burkha, leaving only her eyes visible . Local residents were left furious after the work - believed to be worth more than £100,000 - was vandalised, adding it had been the 'only thing that made them smile in Hounslow'. Sandra D'Souza said she was 'horrified' when she saw the defaced artwork. She said: 'I'm sure it brought a smile to the face of lots of other people passing by and it's such a shame it's been defaced like this.' Sam Spencer, 32, added: 'I was walking to Hounslow station on Sunday, which is right near the Banksy and saw the girl had been covered with a burkha. 'I don't know what is wrong with people around here - it's about the only thing Hounslow has got going for it and now it's ruined.' Twitter user @missfab2014 said the work was the 'only decent thing' in Hounslow and urged the artist to fix it . A Twitter user, known as Ems, urged the artist to come and fix the work. She said: 'The only decent thing in Hounslow and now look at it #banksy @thereaIbanksy come sort it out pls!!' Soon after the mural appeared in 2007, Paul Riley, the then landlord of the North Star pub - now a bar called Platform 3 - installed CCTV to stop the Banksy being vandalised. It is not known if the cameras are still in place. He said at the time: 'I phoned the council to tell them not to paint over it because it was a work of art. 'They came to look at it and agreed with me. I think it is lovely.' UPDATE: A representative for Banksy has confirmed to MailOnline that the work is not by the artist. The work has now been restored. Because of the value attached to many of Banky's pieces, his work had long been targeted by thieves hoping to sell stolen work for huge amounts. But they've also been attacked by vandals - some rival graffiti artists - for no other apparent purpose than to deface and destroy the work. His Spybooth painting, featuring three 1950s-style agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box, appeared in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in April last year. It soared in value when Banksy confirmed it was one of his pieces - and the wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated £1million to secure it for the town. It was defaced a few months later - and last month, the stencil was granted Grade II-listed status. The 'Spybooth' Banksy in Cheltenham features three agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box. Pictured left, in 2014 and right, its defaced state . But the owner of the property it is on says the work has 'ruined his life'. David Possee, 45, says he has been unable to remove and sell the work - and cannot carry out building work to make the house habitable. Last year, a Banksy painting of a woman staring at an empty plinth on the wall of an amusement arcade in Folkestone, Kent, was valued at £300,000. The local council quickly placed a perspex cover over the mural to protect it, heading off a potential disastrous act of vandalism when someone later crudely scrawled a penis on the plinth. Last October, a large mural in the elusive artist's hometown of Bristol - dubbed 'The Girl With The Pierced Eardrum' - had paint thrown over it days after it appeared. The work, a parody of the famous Girl With A Pearl Earring by Dutch master Vermeer, had a yellow alarm box replacing the earring from the original painting.

All article text:Warm applause fluttered around Wembley as Harry Kane slowly jogged up the touchline in the first half, but on the pitch Danny Welbeck was putting in a performance to indicate he is in no mood to step aside anytime soon. Roy Hodgson’s selection of Welbeck ahead of the in-form Kane in England Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania divided opinion across the nation ahead of kick-off. Should he have started the hot-shot Spurs striker, joint-top in the Premier League with Diego Costa on 19 and with 29 in all competitions? Or Welbeck who has been performing well for the national team but in-and-out of Arsenal’s starting line-up, struggling to eight goals in 34? Danny Welbeck leads the celebrations after putting England 2-0 ahead against Lithuania on Friday . Welbeck's header deflects into the back of the net to send England into a commanding lead . Welbeck is congratulated by England captain Wayne Rooney after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign . Former England striker Ian Wright thought the former. ‘Gutted that Harry Kane's not starting,’ he said before kick-off, ‘29 goals, form of his life.’ But within six minutes, the Arsenal man had justified the choice with a huge hand in the opener. Welbeck started on the left, but was to the right of goal when he nutmegged Lithuania’s Tadas Kijanskas with some nifty footwork and fired a shot across goal, which keeper Giedrius Arlauskis could only parry into the path of Wayne Rooney to head in. He almost set up a second on 19 minutes, again getting to the byline on the right before crossing deep to Rooney, who looped a header back across goal and on to the post. Welbeck was bright and alive around the box and got the goal his first-half performance deserved just before the break. Jordan Henderson crossed from the left and he diverted it in off a shoulder via a deflection. They all count. Welbeck caused the Lithuanian defence problems all evening and justified his selection . Welbeck is congratulated by former Manchester united team-mate Wayne Rooney after doubling the lead . Kane may be the latest boy wonder, yet Welbeck is the top-scorer in this Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. His goal moved him to six for the tournament, clear of Israel’s Omar Damari on five. Doubles against Slovenia and Switzerland, a goal versus San Marino and another against Lithuania is not a bad return. Say what you will about the strength of the opposition, but players can only score against what is put in front of them. Hodgson certainly recognised his value, choosing Welbeck as one of only four players - alongside Rooney, Gary Cahill and Nathaniel Clyne - to start from the last team he picked. Dat Guy Welbz, as he was dubbed by Ravel Morrison providing a nickname that went viral, did not let his manager down. He was close to adding another on 41 minutes, riding a challenge and bending a shot towards the top right corner from the edge of the box which was narrowly over. Welbeck is the first to congratulate debutant Harry Kane after scoring two minutes after coming on . Welbeck celebrates with Rooney after he turns home the rebound after the Arsenal striker's effort was saved . And again in the 54th, beating two men on his way into the penalty area to the right of goal and powering a shot on target which was pushed out for a corner. He would surely have had a second had Raheem Sterling not arrived in the box a fraction earlier to tap in England’s third. This may only have been Lithuania, the team ranked 94th in the world, but Welbeck’s passing was crisp and accurate, his runs inventive and movement fluid. An indication of his confidence was a clever back-heel flick in the middle of a quick England passing exchange early in the second half. England’s front three of Welbeck, Rooney and Raheem Sterling were swapping places all evening causing havoc to Lithuania’s defenders. Welbeck was substituted for Theo Walcott in the 77th minute, but the sponsors had seen enough to vote him their man-of-the-match. Kane may have scored within two minutes of coming on, but, for now, Welbeck will be going nowhere in the big games.

All article text:An Ohio couple are pleading with authorities not to take their 41-year-old toothless black bear Archie away from them. Jeffrey and Debra Gillium failed to apply for a permit on time to keep the caged animal on their property outside of Akron and now the Ohio Department of Agriculture say they are going to confiscate Archie. The Gillium's have launched a change.org petition to drum up support and to date have garnered more than 5,500 signatures. Legal fight: Archie the 41-year-old bear is at the center of a legal tug-of-war between his owners and the Ohio Department of Agriculture . Home: Archie the bear has lived with Jeffrey and Debra Gillium for the past 35-years but could be taken away from them because of red tape . Indeed, animal rights group Renegade's Run have come out in favor of the Gillium's keeping the bear and said that to take Archie away is not in his best interests. However, the Ohio state authorities have told CBS News that they will deny the tardy permit submitted by the couple because it was entered on February 27, one year after the supposed deadline. They also claim the Gillium's have failed to ever properly register Archie and have the bear microchipped. Despite this, it was hoped that Archie would be given special dispensation and allowed to live out his days with his owners on their 2.6 acre rural and secluded farm near to Lodi, which is 30 miles away from Akron. Owner: Jeffrey Gillium squats near Archie's cage where his toothless black bear is caged on his Ohio farm . Mother: Debra Gillium has been campaigning for the past 18 months to keep Archie from being confiscated from her . Support for Archie: One of the thousands who have signed up to support the old bear protest the Ohio Department of Agriculture . The couple have said that they have had the bear for 35-years and never had one incident and their attorney has said the couple will build a new cage for him. If they do not get a new permit for Archie the Department of Agriculture will most likely take him away in the next month. The Gillium's have filed a civil complaint and claimed they were not notified about the new rules which came into place when a suicidal owner released dozens of tigers and lions from his Ohio farm in 2011. The state has said that the law is the law and they can't approve any new permits for anyone who didn't apply before January 1 2014. A hearing is scheduled April 9.

However, they were shocked when they found over 1000 pairs of runners and slippers stashed away in a 57-year-old man's Melbourne unit. The Kilsyth thief had been caught on CCTV scouring the area where he lived for the past three months but when he invited police into his home they had no idea as to the extent of his crazy shoe robbing spree. Scroll down for video . Police have been forced to play Prince Charming after numerous residents complained that their shoes had gone missing from their front gardens . The man has stashed the shoes all over his unit, filling up cupboards with the footwear and forming massive piles in corners of his house. In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom. Police found about 600 pairs of shoes piled high under his bed and he stacked them so high that the windows in the bedroom could not be opened. However, they were shocked when they found over 1000 pairs of runners and slippers stashed away in a 57-year-old man's Melbourne unit . Police have been trying to sort through 40 bags of shoes they collected from the man's house. The shoes range from women's to men's and even children's shoes. A pair of yellow fluffy Tweety bird slippers stood out, as did a pair of expensive looking runners and some dolphin slippers. While the man has an obvious fascination with shoes, police believe he does not have mental issues. The Kilsyth thief had been caught on CCTV scouring the area where he lived for the past three months but when he invited police into his home they had no idea as to the extent of his crazy shoe robbing spree . The man has stashed the shoes all over his unit, filling up cupboards with the footwear and forming massive piles in corners of his house . Although there were over 1000 pairs of shoes, the man was reportedly only ever seen wearing one pair of shoes. His only explanation to police was that 'he just liked shoes'. 'They were in his kitchen cupboards, under his sinks, they were in the cupboards above the sink,' Leading Senior Constable Baker told The Age. In the loungeroom, he hid about 50 pairs of shoes under the table and couch and hid hundreds more in the kitchen and bathroom . Police found about 600 pairs of shoes piled high under his bed and he stacked them so high that the windows in the bedroom could not be opened . 'It really looks like he's just an old man, who is harmless. He's never been in trouble with the police before and he's just got a fascination with shoes.' 'This is just purely someone who likes shoes,' he said. While police are investigating the incident, they have taken a light-hearted approach to the investigation and are holding an open day at the station so the public can reclaim their shoes. 'If you have had shoes stolen in the Kilsyth and Mooroolbark area you are invited to attend the Mooroolbark Police station on Sunday 29 March between 11am-4pm to see if the shoe fits you,' they said. The shoes ranged from women's to men's and even children's shoes. A pair of yellow fluffy Tweety bird slippers stood out, as did a pair of expensive looking runners and some dolphin slippers . While the man has an obvious fascination with shoes, police believe he does not have mental issues .

All article text:At one minute to three, Tony Mowbray walked from the spacious Ricoh Arena tunnel, gave a thumbs up to the photographers clicking away and returned to the capricious game that is football management. By five o’clock, he must have been wondering quite what he’d thrown himself back into after a rollercoaster afternoon that did nothing to soothe Coventry City’s acute relegation anxieties. Mowbray had not stood on a touchline since October 19, 2013, when his Middlesbrough team were beaten 3-2 by Barnsley at Oakwell. The game has certainly not grown any kinder or more predictable in the meantime. Coventry's Jim O'Brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match . Coventry City: Burge, Phillips, Pennington, Martin, Stokes, O'Brien (Jackson 77),, Barton (Odelusi 62), Fleck, Nouble, Tudgay (Williams 63), Samuel . Subs not used: Webster, Turgott, Finch, Charles-Cook . Booked: O'Brien . Scorer(s): O'Brien 4, Odelusi 70 . Port Vale: Neal, Veseli, Inniss (McGivern 36), Robertson, Dickinson, Moore (Daniel 81), Brown, O'Connor, Marshall, Williamson (Dodds 77), Pope . Subs not used: Yates, Birchall, Lines, Johnson . Booked: Dickinson, Inniss . Scorer(s): Pope 40, Marshall 45, O'Connor 76 . Referee: Mick Russell . Attendance: 9,446 . The 51-year-old Yorkshireman, late of Hibernian, West Brom, Celtic and Teesside, spoke of restoring City’s glory days when he arrived in the week. But his short-term contract speaks of a more pressing mission - saving the Sky Blues, famously FA Cup winners in 1987 and staple of the top flight for many years, from the indignity of League Two football. They remain above the relegation zone - just, by a sole point - after this 3-2 defeat but the new boss will be under no illusions that this is no time for grand future plans, just steely focus and cast-iron resolve. The initial signs had been so positive. On the first sunny afternoon of Spring, the whole place seemed energised by Mowbray’s arrival and Coventry had a precious lead just four minutes in. From the left, the ball was worked into Dominic Samuel’s feet but he couldn’t get them synchronised to shoot. Instead, he passed backwards to O’Brien in plenty of space and he picked out the bottom corner with a perfectly-placed shot from 20 yards. Tony Mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of Coventry . ‘We are staying up’, sang the home faithful, confident again that a club in the Premier League as recently as 2000-01 wouldn’t be playing fourth tier football next season for the first time since 1959. Mowbray - who spent most of the match stood, hands in pockets, on the edge of his technical area - betrayed little emotion. It was only a start, after all. The Sky Blues were well on top, looking threatening going forward and Samuel’s deflected shot from a good position had Chris Neal scrambling across. But Vale, who still harbour hopes of reaching the play-offs, slowly grew into the game and took command in the minutes just before half-time. First, Tom Pope was left with a straightforward side-foot finish after the ball was played across the penalty area, nobody seemingly wanting to take responsibility. There was a strong suspicion of offside, but the striker’s 11th goal of the season stood. Few will come as easily as that for him. Then, four minutes later, Coventry’s fragile confidence at the back was dented again. The impressive Mark Marshall played a neat one-two with Michael O’Connor around the home defence and produced an emphatic finish. The Coventry wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start . To make matters worse, Marshall had been released by Mowbray’s predecessor Steven Pressley last summer having been deemed unworthy of a new contract. Marshall politely declined to celebrate. The travelling masses were less diplomatic, chanting ‘that’s why you’re going down.’ Mowbray sent his players out five minutes early for the second-half and, having composed themselves following the double blow before the break, they started on the front foot. O’Brien’s flighted cleared by Neal’s legs just a fraction ahead of the onrushing John Fleck and Aaron Phillips curled an effort wide from range. But they couldn’t sustain the bright start, allowing Vale to dictate things again. Byron Moore volleyed over the bar after a clever piece of chest control and Marshall tested Lee Burge with a low drive. The former Middlesbrough and Celtic manager holds his arms aloft in appeal at the Ricoh Arena . Then, out of nothing, an equaliser. Frank Nouble, brought back into the side by Mowbray, bulldozed his way forward on the counter-attack before picking out Sanmi Odelusi bursting up on his right. After a touch to control, the substitute rifled home and in one swing of the boot, totally transformed the mood. A cloud of thick blue smoke rose in one corner from a flare as the home fans found their voices again. Not for long. From their next piece of attacking play, Vale were awarded a free-kick 25 yards out after O’Brien felled Michael Brown. Up stepped Michael O’Connor, bending the ball precisely around the wall and beyond the outstretched arm of Burge. Mowbray didn’t know where to look. Some welcome back to football this had been.

Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, 77, who represents by the District of Columbia, was secretly filmed on Wednesday morning as she drove  into a spot on Capitol Hill at the wrong angle. Instead of pushing forwards at 45-degrees, she blindly performed a perpendicular  maneuver. As a result, the back and front ends of her car were almost touching other vehicles, while her bumper  also rested well over the curb. Scroll down for video . Wrong move: Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, 77, who represents by the District of Columbia, was secretly filmed on Wednesday morning as she drove her car into a spot on Capitol Hill at the wrong angle . Oblivious: Instead of pushing forwards at 45-degrees, she blindly performed a perpendicular maneuver . Footage shows her jutting to a standstill as a young aide runs over to help. But he decides there is little he can do to help the situation and goes over to help Norton out of the silver sedan instead. As he strolls to the driver's door, around the 40-second mark, a U.S. Capitol police officer zooms by on a motorcycle apparently oblivious to the parking offense. Norton, a Yale alumni, then locks her car and walks away. But before getting too far she stops and returns to her vehicle. It looks like she might have spotted her bad parking. However, it transpires that she's merely forgotten something. After retrieving the possession she locks up and walks off. In the spotlight: Norton is a Delegate to the U.S Congress representing the District of Columbia . The tipster who filmed the incident can be head tutting in the background. 'Eleanor Holmes Norton is struggling to park her car right now and she has hit that red car next to her... repeatedly,' the unidentified man says. 'If she parks like that, she should not be in congress.' To date the clip, leaked by the political website Roll Call, has been watched more than 74,000 times. Many viewers have questioned Norton's political ability after seeing her behind the wheel. A spokesperson from the widowed mother-of-two's office told Roll Call that there was no harm caused from the not-so-great parking job . 'After the congresswoman parked her car, we assessed the cars on either side to see if there was any damage. We could not find any. 'But we left a note with a business card so the congresswoman could be contacted in case we missed any.'

All article text:Arrested again: Radio DJ Neil Fox was arrested after voluntarily attending a central London police station today in connection with a sexual assault . Radio DJ Neil Fox was today arrested for the third time on suspicion of sexual offences. The 53-year-old, who has been suspended from his job at Magic FM while police inquiries continue, is accused of a woman in the 1990s. In September Fox, who lives in Fulham, south west London with his wife and children, was arrested in relation to four alleged incidents against two women. Two months later he revisited a central London police station where he was accused of three more offences. Today Scotland Yard confirmed he had been arrested again in relation to an additional alleged incident. The eight alleged incidents are said to have taken place in the 1990s, in 2007 and in the past year. Fox, a former Pop Idol judge, vehemently denied the allegations after his first arrest. Today a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Officers from Westminster arrested a 53-year-old man last September following four allegations of sexual assault against two women. 'Three of the allegations are non-recent; one is from earlier this year. 'The man was arrested at a business address in central London and taken to a central London police station. 'Officers subsequently searched addresses in Fulham and the Littlehampton area of West Sussex. 'On Monday December 8th he returned on bail to a central London police station and was arrested for a further three sexual assaults involving different women. 'Two allegations are said have happened in the 1990s, the third was said to have happened in 2007. Scroll down for video . 'Today, he voluntarily attended a central London police station and was further arrested for an allegation of sexual assault against an additional female victim. This offence is said to have happened in the early 1990s. 'The man has now been bailed to return pending further inquiries to a date in late March.' Mr Fox was first held by detectives on September 30 at the Magic FM offices in London just moments after coming off-air . Following his arrest last September the DJ, who rose to fame in the late 1980s at London's Capital Radio, vowed to clear his name. Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, began his career in local radio before moving to Radio Luxembourg and then London's Capital Radio in the late 1980s. He presented various slots there and in 1993, landed the job of presenting the Sunday afternoon Network Chart Show, later known as the Pepsi chart. His big TV break, which brought him to a wider audience, was as a judge on ITV talent show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman, and Nicki Chapman. Fox later appeared in the BBC Three sketch show The Wrong Door. He left Capital in 2005 and joined Magic 105.4, where he presented the breakfast show until being suspended following his arrest last September. Speaking outside the south west London home where he lives with his 41-year-old wife and three children the day after being arrested, he told gathered reporters: ‘Obviously I had a very stressful day yesterday - it was a complete surprise. ‘I haven’t really got much very to say in terms of a statement at the moment. I need to go and speak to my lawyer and see where it all stands and just see where we are.’ ‘I’ve got three young children trying to get on with their school life and you have to respect their privacy in all of this. 'It’s nothing to do with them, obviously. It’s to do with me and the serious allegations made against me, and obviously what I want to do is work hard to clear my name. 'As and when I've got more to say I will.’ Officers spent some seven hours questioning the DJ before bailing him. He was suspended from his regular slot at Magic FM as a result, with the station eager to allow him 'to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters. 'All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. 'We can make no further comment at this stage.’ Fox's arrest is not part of Operation Yewtree - the high profile Scotland Yard investigation into alleged sexual offences that was sparked by the Jimmy Savile scandal. Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart . The former Pop Idol judge, 53, pictured with his wife Vicky, has now been arrested three times over alleged sexual assaults . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Dean Smith, from Scottsdale, Arizona, made a video for his girlfriend Jennifer Kessel that showed the 365 days he asked for her hand in marriage. The reveal happened during a large family trip to Aruba, where Jennifer was instructed via a whiteboard held by her sister Jaclyn to go down to the lobby. There her brother and then a friend helped lead Jennifer to the beach, where her father and stepmother were waiting to hand her a device where she could watch the film. Scroll down for video .

The video cuts to a film Dean made the exact same day a year before. 'Today is the day that I decided I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' he reveals . 'By now you've probably realized that your birthday surprise is in the form of this video,' Smith begins on screen. 'What you don't know is that I've been planning this birthday surprise for over a year now.' The video then cuts to a film Dean made on Jennifer's birthday the previous year. 'I just wanted to make this video to tell you that today is the day that I decided I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' he reveals. But, Dean says in the film, he wanted to find a way to propose to Jennifer that would show her just how much he loved her, and that he thought about her 'literally every moment of every day'.

All article text:One in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found (picture posed by model) It is known as the most important meal of the day. But one in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found. This can leave them tired and moody and lower the quality of their work, oat producer Flahavan's said. While two in three people are eating breakfast every day, the study found one in 13 never had a morning meal. Of those who are regularly missing out, two-thirds said they found it difficult to eat early in the morning, with other reasons including not considering breakfast important, not having time, preferring to stay in bed and having too many chores. The results showed more people were regularly missing the first meal of the day, compared with the 20 per cent who were skipping it three years ago. The time taken to eat the meal is also lower, now at just over nine minutes compared to almost ten in 2012. What the nation is eating for breakfast appears to be constantly changing, too. While cold cereals, porridge, fruit and toast remain the staple morning fuel for the majority of breakfasters, the fry up has now become an occasional treat with only 1.5 per cent of respondents saying they started the day with a traditional breakfast most days of the week. John Noonan, of Flahavan's, said: 'Our findings show a shift in the number of people having breakfast - the eating occasion renowned for being the most important meal of the day. Just 1.5 per cent of people have a traditional fried breakfast before work every morning, a study found . 'It's no secret that we all need a good breakfast to get the day off to a good start. 'And while it's great to see that people are becoming more health-conscious with their breakfast choices - opting for porridge and healthy cereals - the number of people who are regularly going without breakfast is certainly surprising, particularly given that making a nutritious, tasty breakfast takes no time at all. 'We know that people are time-pressured, particularly from Monday to Friday, but skipping breakfast only results in people feeling worse in the long-run, as they don't have enough energy to power them through the day.'

All article text:Holiday costs in eurozone countries are looking significantly cheaper this year. On Friday, the pound was worth €1.38 – which for British holidaymakers heading to, say, France, Spain, Italy and Greece is the most favourable rate for more than seven years. It’s around 14 per cent better than this time last year, and 20 per cent better than five years ago. Holidaymakers booking a village in the South of France can save more than £200 compared with last year . Put more graphically, if that villa in the South of France you’re looking at costs €2,000 (£1,450) a week to rent, it’s £231 cheaper than it was in 2014 and £353 cheaper than in 2010. Likewise, a meal for two in Venice with a €100 (£72) price tag costs roughly £12 less than this time last year, and £18 less than in 2010. Here are some issues that the better pound/euro exchange rate raises – but remember that if you use cards to get cash out of overseas ATMs, settle hotel and restaurant bills and make purchases, the actual exchange rate won’t be quite as good, due to the banks taking commission. Holidaymakers may get a better deal by booking direct, in euros, as most prices were fixed last year . Book direct? Most holiday companies will have fixed their prices with hoteliers and villa owners last year, when the pound was weaker against the euro. This means you may well get a better deal by booking direct, in euros. That said, I know of a number of operators and villa agencies that have recently lowered prices to take into account the better exchange rate, and tailor-made arrangements may be based on current exchange rates. So it’s worth doing DIY vs package price comparisons. Also bear in mind that you get better financial protection and back-up when you book a package. If you do book direct, to be sure of benefiting from the current good exchange rate, you need to pay in full now rather than putting down a deposit or paying on arrival/departure. The rate may be even better in a few months’ time, but of course it may have worsened. You could hedge your bets by obtaining some (but not all) of your spending money now . Buy euros now? The pound was worth about €1.40 a week ago, but by Friday it had fallen slightly. No one knows what it will do next, so if you buy euros now, you’re taking a gamble. But you could hedge your bets by obtaining some (but not all) of your spending money now. Consider doing so with a pre-paid euro currency card – the exchange rate used will be whatever it is on the day you upload the funds. The Ukash Travel Money MasterCard (ukash.com) has very competitive exchange rates and charges no fees for making purchases or cash withdrawals. A driving holiday on the Continent? The combination of more favourable exchange rates and lower oil prices means that filling up the car in eurozone countries is costing British motorists a lot less than a year ago. According to a Post Office Travel Money report, when converted into pounds, the price of a litre of unleaded petrol in France, Italy, Spain, Germany and Austria is down year-on-year by at least 20 per cent. In many European countries, fuel is also markedly cheaper than in the UK – about 10p less per litre of unleaded in France than in the UK. Prague is an attractive destination for Britons as the Czech koruna has plummeted against sterling . Beyond the eurozone . Exchange rates have also improved significantly for British travellers heading to some European countries outside the eurozone. Notoriously expensive Scandinavia is looking more affordable. Compared with this time two years ago, the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona are about 25 per cent weaker against the pound. You might also want to consider a break to Prague: the Czech koruna has plummeted over 20 per cent against sterling since spring 2013. But if you’re thinking of heading to the US this year, things are not looking so rosy. The strength of the US economy means that the pound is weaker against the dollar than at any time since June 2010. Worth a paltry $1.47 on Friday, the pound has dropped by more than ten per cent from 12 months ago – bumping up accommodation and day-to-day costs. Bear in mind that it’s not just in the States where the strong dollar is making things pricier for British visitors. The same is true in other holiday spots where currencies are pegged to the US dollar, such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua in the Caribbean, and Dubai.

The same is true in other holiday spots where currencies are pegged to the US dollar, such as Barbados, St Lucia and Antigua in the Caribbean, and Dubai. 
----------------------------------------
Ground truth Summary: The pound's value against the euro on Friday was strongest in seven years .
The pound's worth of €1.38 is 14 per cent better than this time last year .
It means a villa in the south of France worth €2,000 (£1,450) is £231 cheaper .
Compare DIY vs package prices to ensure you're getting the best value .
With the exchange rate and low oil prices, fill up the car for a road trip .

All article text:(CNN)A dark intersection. A church van full of parishioners. And tragedy. That's about all police in Glades County, Florida, had to work with early Monday, hours after a van with 18 people inside ran a stop sign, crossed a four-lane highway and plunged into a shallow water-filled ditch. Eight people died. Ten others, including a 4-year-old child, were injured, according to police. Investigators don't know why it happened,  Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Greg Bueno told CNN affiliate WPBF. The driver died, and police haven't been able to interview passengers yet. "Our hearts go out to the families of the victims," Bueno said. "It breaks your heart to see something like this happen." Some relatives of the crash victims, all of whom were from the Independent Haitian Assembly of God in Fort Pierce, gathered at the rural intersection Monday morning. Others went to the church. "We've lost a lot of family members, church family," Phillipe Dorce, who said he lost his father, told WPBF. "All we can do is pray (to) God to help us out. Pray for us. It's very sad for us." Linda Dolce told the news site TCPalm.com that her grandmother died in the crash. She'd arrived from Haiti six years ago. "She loved singing and helping people," TCPalm.com quoted her as saying. "She was exciting; she was the best lady to us." Laura Lochard told the site that her uncle died in the crash, leaving behind four children, the youngest of which is 16, whom he brought to the United States from Haiti. He was like a father to her, too, she said. "It's never easy to lose a person, but I have to be strong," she told the site. "I'll never forget his smile." A pastor at the church, Sereste Doresma told CNN that parishioners had attended a revival in Fort Myers and had left Sunday afternoon. "This is a very difficult day for us today," he said. The van apparently was traveling east on State Road 78 when it ran a stop sign at U.S. Highway 27 early Monday, authorities said. It then crossed all four lanes of U.S. 27 and stopped in a ditch that was partially filled with water. No one saw the accident on the rural stretch of roadway that's frequented mostly by commercial traffic, Bueno said. One of the passengers flagged down a passing vehicle, whose driver called police, the trooper said. Police had to remove the seats of the van to remove passengers, Bueno said. Among other things, investigators are looking into the capacity of the van. It appeared to be rated for 16 passengers, Bueno said. Of the passengers, all were adults except for the 4-year-old, who was in stable condition at a  hospital, Bueno said. Two of the adult passengers were in critical condition, he said. Passengers were being treated at four hospitals.

All article text:Dick Advocaat has confirmed that Adam Johnson is available for selection ahead of his first game in charge at West Ham. The Sunderland winger returned to training on Wednesday after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. The Black Cats took the decision to allow Johnson to return after his bail was extended to April 23. New Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat has confirmed that Adam Johnson will be available for selection . Advocaat faced the media as Sunderland boss for the first time as he bids to save them from the drop . The veteran Dutch manager admitted it was a big challenge taking over at the Stadium of Light . Advocaat has worked with the 27-year-old at the Academy of Light this week and he took part in a full-scale practice match on Thursday. And, when asked during his unveiling press conference if Johnson would play at West Ham, Advocaat said: ‘Everyone who is training is available for selection. ‘I name the squad after the final training session.’ Advocaat has inherited a side one point and one place above the drop zone. The Dutchman, however, had no reservations about taking on the task at the Stadium of Light. Johnson is available for selection after the Mackems lifted his suspension following his arrest on March 2 . ‘It’s a big challenge to take over in this position,’ said the 67-year-old, who revealed this week that he has known for a few weeks he was in line to replace Gus Poyet. ‘I was a free man after what happened in Serbia (sacked in November).‘The opportunity came and I thought, in my opinion, it was a good side and a great club – so why not? ‘In Holland we can see all of the games on TV. I know the players. We have a great stadium and great fans – with their support we should be able to stay up. Johnson rejoined his team-mates on Wednesday, followed by a full training match on Thursday . ‘I have a good feeling about the squad from the last three days.’ Advocaat has signed a nine-game deal on Wearside and is almost certain to return to Holland at the end of the season.

All article text:A bride who shot her niece dead during an argument on her wedding night is claiming it was a drunken accident. Christina George-Harvan, 30 and Katelyn Francis, 21, were celebrating at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton, Pennsylvania, after the ceremony on April 24, 2014 when they started arguing over who should drive home. The row spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car when the gun went off. Prosecutors say George-Harvan took the weapon from the center console and deliberately shot Francis, but her defense claims it fired by accident. She is facing third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges. Scroll down for video . Christina George-Harvan, 30 (pictured in court on Friday) has been accused of shooting her niece Katelyn Francis dead. She claims it was just a drunken accident . George-Harvan and Francis, 21, (pictured) were partying after a wedding 30 miles south of Pittsburgh on April 24, 2014 . George-Harvan, a former nurse, took to the stand on Thursday during her trial.  She told the court about the hours leading up the shooting - saying there was no tension with her niece. According to CBS Pittsburgh, she said: 'I was happy…she was so cute. We were only nine years apart. The first thing she did was say, 'Aunt Tina, I'm so happy for you,' and gave me a big hug.' As the night went on they drank more, the court heard, and soon Mr Harvan was determined to drive home. However Francis demanded she be the designated driver and tried to take the keys off of him. George-Harvan said: 'When I turned around, the glove box is open and I see this gun. I think I gotta move this gun. I go get it out of the glove box to move it and boom the gun goes off. The defense attorney then asked: 'Did you squeeze the trigger?' And she replied: 'No.' Recounting the moment she realized she had shot her niece, she said: 'Everything freezes, Jeremy says, 'You just shot your [expletive] cousin'. George-Harvan (pictured before her first court appearance the day after the shooting) said she would never hurt her niece and insists there was no tension between the pair earlier in the evening . The row had spilled into the parking lot and then into new husband Jeremy Harvan's car (inside on night of shooting pictured) when the gun went off. George-Harvan claims it fired when she tried to move it . 'He steps over her dying body and he runs. I put pressure on [Katelyn's[ wound and I screamed and dialed 911. She added, 'I felt devastated. It was like a nightmare. Your wedding day is supposed to be the best day of your life and my niece is dead.' The prosecution rested on Thursday. The defense called former Pennsylvania State Trooper Frederick Wentling as a ballistic experts. He told the court the weapon could discharge with just the slightest pressure on the trigger. According to CBS Pittsburgh, he said: 'If you put your thumb in… if you pick it up sideways, and put your thumb in there and pull it back, it will discharge. 'It's supposed to. It doesn't know what's pulling it to the rear.' On Friday Prosecutor Brittany Smith told the jury, 'She shot somebody. She killed somebody. Do you think she used reasonable care?' The jury is now deliberating and is considering third-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter. The defense argues the jury should acquit her of any homicide charge under the doctrine of 'excusable homicide by misadventure,'. The defendant has to have shown carelessness without criminal intent for that to be proven. George-Harvan, her new husband and Francis went out drinking to celebrate the marriage at Jimmy K's bar in New Brighton and subsequently got into a fight over who would drive home .

All article text:For  a moment, the image seemed wrong. Celebrating in the corner were a group of giddy England players, while slumped in the penalty area were clutch of crestfallen Germans. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Important matches between these two old foes tend to end one way and rarely is the outcome happy for England. Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate, after all, knows that better than most. But this was no apparition: two goals in two minutes from Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse provided further evidence this squad Southgate has impressively moulded is an emerging force. When Euro 2015 starts 80 days from now, do not doubt they possess what it takes to win it. This 3-2 win at a rain sodden Riverside Stadium, achieved after they had trailed twice, was stamped with the qualities of a team that can win a major tournament: quality, technique and spirit coming to the fore. Never was it more evident than when Ward-Prowse scored the decisive goal. James Ward-Prowse wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in England Under 21's 3-2 defeat of Germany . The Southampton midfielder completed an unlikely comeback that saw two late goals scored in the space of three minutes . Nathan Redmond leaps for joy after bringing England level at 2-2 with a deflected shot in the second half . England were heading towards defeat before Redmond's strike on 79minutes brought them back into the game . Jesse Lindgard brought England level for the first time with a composed finish from Carl Jenkinson's cross in the first half . Germany striker Philipp Hofmann scored a brace but could not prevent the Young Lions from a memorable victory . Hofmann slides in in front of Everton defender John Stones to restore Germany's lead at the start of the second half . ENGLAND (4-2-3-1): Bond 6.5: Jenkinson 7.5, Stones 7, Gibson 6.5 (Keane 77mins), Garbutt 6.5: Ward-Prowse 7.5, Forster-Caskey 7: Lingard 7.5, Hughes 6.5 (Pritchard 65mins 6), Redmond 8: Ings 7 . Subs not used: Bettinelli, Moore, Woodrow. Scorers: Lingard 34, Redmond 79, Ward-Prowse 82. GERMANY (4-3-3): Ter Stegen 7: Korb 6.5, Ginter 7, Knoche 6.5, Gunter 6.5: Can 7, Leitner 6 (Kimmich 46mins 6), Younes 6: Bittencourt 6 (Gnabry 46mins 7), Hofmann 7.5, Meyer 6.5 (Schulz 68mins) Subs not used: Orban, Geis, Zimmer, Klaus, Horn, Karius. Booked: Leitner. Scorers: Hofmann 15, 50. Man of the match: Carl Jenkinson. Referee: Davide Massa (Italy) 7. Expectations of a bold show in the Czech Republic can now build but Southgate, who has only lost one of the 16 games for which he has been in charge, was rather more circumspect. Yes, he was pleased but he was also quick to sound a note of caution. ‘How do I keep a check on expectations,’ he asked. ‘That’s easy. I’ll just show people the first 25 minutes of this game. We have tremendous belief in this group of players and some elements of what they did really pleased me. Other aspects showed we can definitely improve.’ The last time Southgate had stood in the technical area of this particular stadium, it came before one of the darkest moments of his career: the events of October 20, 2009, when he was sacked by Middlesbrough, will never leave him. He returned, however, a more confident and mature manager and he has thrived in this role with the FA, getting the Under-21s playing a vibrant, attractive brand of football that will see them go to the Czech Republic with genuine ambitions of success. Germany, though, will go there with the same mind-set and there is no doubt they will be big players when the tournament starts because of the big players they have in their ranks; Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, the Barcelona keeper, Emre Can of Liverpool and Max Meyer of Schalke to name but three. They started this contest impressively, moving the ball with purpose and ambition and in the first 10 minutes England had trouble getting out of their own half. Germany retained possession with ease and there was an inevitability they would strike first. When Germany broke the deadlock, they did it in style. Matthias Ginter skipper down the left and clipped in a cross that Philipp Hofmann, celebrating his 22nd birthday, controlled with his right foot before smashing a drive beyond Jonathon Bond with his left. For a moment it seemed like Germany might go through the gears but this England team has spirit as well as ability and their speed caused problems; Lingard (twice) and Danny Ings both tested Stegen before Lingard’s industry was rewarded in the 34th minute and parity was restored. Half-time arrived and checked England’s momentum. Germany made changes and the introduction of Arsenal flyer Serge Gnabry gave them blistering pace and trickery to attack Everton left-bacl Luke Garbutt. He made an immediate impact, thrilling providing Hofmann’s second of the night. Yet England were not done and they staged a grandstand comeback, Redmond equalised in the 78th minute before Ward-Prowse won it when bursting through. The players, then, can start to dream and, perhaps in a quiet moment, Southgate will too. ‘We have not achieved anything yet,’ he said. ‘We know what our goal is and we want to get there.’ Hoffman, who plays in Germany's second division, strikes to open the scoring for Germany after 15minutes . The Germany striker wheels away in celebration after handing the visitors the lead in this international friendly . Germany players celebrate after opening the scoring, but left the Riverside Stadium in shock after England's comeback victory . Liverpool and Germany midfielder/defender Emre Can (right) slides in for a tackle on England's Jake Forster-Caskey .

Lingard watches his composed finish find the net after meeting a right wing pass from Carl Jenkinson . The Manchester United forward races off to celebrate his first goal for England's Under 21s .

All article text:Members of the Royal Household are poised to take industrial action over pay for the first time in history, it was claimed last night. Wardens at Windsor Castle claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money. Union officials say guides are paid terribly and have suffered years of ‘wage restraint’ despite working for the ‘country’s richest family’. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money . Wardens’ main duties are to meet and greet visitors, tell them about the history of the Castle, and hand out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said many are asked to go above and beyond this for no extra pay, including leading paid-for guided tours at the Castle. Other workers administer first aid or speak to tourists in a foreign language without being paid extra, they said. Now, the PCS says workers could adopt ‘work to rule’ – industrial action where workers do no more than the minimum required by their contract – unless they receive a pay hike. They said wardens were on as little as £7.70 an hour, or £14,400 a year for a 36-hour week. This is below the Living Wage, a voluntary threshold for employers which rose to £7.85 in November, but significantly above the minimum wage of £6.50 an hour. Windsor Castle said wages will rise to the new Living Wage in April, but the PCS argue this should have happened last November. A spokesman for PCS said: ‘Workers are being paid really poor wages despite working for the country’s richest family. Windsor Castle (pictured) said wages will rise to the new Living Wage in April, but the PCS argue this should have happened last November . ‘A large proportion of staff have chosen to work at the Castle because they feel they are working the Queen and for the Royal Family. ‘Their employers should not take advantage of that and abuse their goodwill by not properly rewarding them.’ The wardens work for the Royal Collection Trust, a charity which presides over one of the world’s largest and most important works of art, jewels and artefacts. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' It is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation, and workers for the Collection are therefore employees of the Royal Household. Forty wardens out of 200 workers at Windsor Castle have been balloted on whether they want to take industrial action. While the union has ruled out a strike, staff may refuse to work overtime and conduct guided tours and insist on taking their full lunch breaks. If wardens vote for this, it would be the first time staff have ever done so over working conditions specific to a Royal Household, the PCS said. A spokeswoman for the Royal Collection Trust said workers undertook extra roles voluntarily and were under no obligation to do so. She said: ‘Warden staff are offered voluntary opportunities to receive training and develop skills to lead guided tours for visitors as part of their working day and to administer first aid, as well as to use their language skills. ‘These are not compulsory aspects of their role, and it is the choice of the individual whether they wish to take part.’ They said staff received a range of benefits including a 15 per cent non-contributory pension and a free lunch. She added: ‘Royal Collection Trust continues to award wardens an annual performance-related pay increase of up to 2.5 per cent, in addition to the cost of living increase, as well as one-off payments to those who have reached the top of their pay scale.’ The Royal Collection said it did not anticipate any interruption to tours in the event of industrial action. The Royal Collection website says its wardens enhance visitors’ experiences by ‘interpreting the exhibits, buildings and works of art whilst maintaining visitors’ safety and security’. It says: ‘Whether you are greeting visitors at the start of their tour, carrying out security and baggage checks, or answering questions along the visitor route, you will be part of an impressive and unique experience.’

All article text:Former England captain Jamie Peacock will swap his rugby kit for a suit at the end of the year when he joins Hull KR in the newly-created role of football manager. The 37-year-old Leeds prop forward is currently completing a masters degree in sports management and will start his new job when he brings his illustrious career to a close at the end of the season. Peacock's new role will see him responsible for, amongst other things, contract negotiations, club strategy, recruitment and pre-season training camps. Jamie Peacock (centre right) has been named the new football manager of Super League club Hull KR . Friday's announcement ends any lingering speculation about the former Bradford skipper playing on beyond his 38th birthday in December. Hull KR chairman Neil Hudgell said: 'We are delighted to have secured Jamie to the full-time position of football manager for the next two years. 'He is a proven champion at the highest level in our sport and we look forward to working with him, drawing on his experiences and contacts and generally raising the profile and performance of the club in key areas. 'I'm sure he will have a big role to play in helping to attract young English talent to Hull Kingston Rovers and in helping to develop a winning culture on and off the field.' Peacock has won a record eight Super League Grand Finals as well as making over 500 appearances for Leeds, Bradford, Yorkshire, England and Great Britain. The Leeds prop will retire from playing at the end of the season and take up his new role at the club . He was named Man of Steel in 2003 and stepped down as England captain in 2012 to concentrate on his club career and will complete a 10th and final campaign with his home-town club. He was awarded the MBE three years ago for services to the sport. Leeds say Peacock was offered an off-field role at Headingley but wanted a fresh challenge. Peacock said: 'I have had a great time at Leeds and learnt so much about how the club is run from top to bottom. 'The Rhinos are a blueprint for a successful sporting business and the challenge for me now is to take those lessons and try and implement my own thoughts in a new environment. 'Hull KR are a club with huge potential within a city that is rugby league mad and having invested wisely in their facilities in recent years. I know a number of people over there already and I am looking forward to working with Chris Chester, Willie Poching, Mike Smith and Neil Hudgell in my new role. Peacock was England captain a few years ago but is excited about his new off-field role . 'Whenever we have gone over there to play, it is clear Rovers have a fanatical supporter base. I think it is vital that you have a hard core of good people who want the club to succeed to be able to build and plan for development in the future. 'Now that I have the next chapter of my career finalised, I am fully focused on finishing my time with Leeds as strongly as possible and leaving my home-town club in the best possible position.' Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington said: 'I think this is an inspired appointment by Hull KR and I know Jamie will be very good at what will be a very different challenge. 'He has been at the heart of all our success over the past decade and his performances and influence at the club cannot be overestimated. He will leave a lasting legacy and all our best wishes will be with him when he swaps his training kit for a new suit at the end of the season.'

All article text:She was a young woman who had her dreams of being a model ruined when she became the victim of an acid attack instigated by her ex-boyfriend in 2008. And on Friday, Katie Piper proved she's stronger than ever by launching the UK's first-ever fashion catwalk that  included models with visible differences. One lady, like Katie, was a sufferer of visible scars from burns and the pair met through Katie's charity foundation. Scroll down for video . Katie Piper launched the UK's first-ever fashion catwalk on Friday and called on one of her friends, who had visible scars from burns, to walk in the show . Launched at the Ideal Home Show, the show - called 'Confidence - The Secret' - aimed to challenge the conventional catwalk. Speaking to FEMAIL about the initiative ahead of the show, she said: 'I am working with The Ideal Home Show as a fashion and beauty ambassador to launch a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from my foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity. It's all incredibly exciting.' The shows, which will also take place on  March  21 and  April 3, have a twist. The models on the catwalk  bravely admitted what their true insecurities are, which aren’t always the obvious anxiety that people assume. Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the representatives wanted to emphasise that what others assume to be their insecurity isn’t always the case. Katie wanted to challenge the conventional catwalk with the launch of the show, which was called 'Confidence - The Secret' and took place at The Ideal Home Show . In her role as a fashion and beauty ambassador for the Ideal Home Show, Katie launched a bespoke show with alternative catwalk models chosen from her foundation, the Katie Piper Foundation, and Models of Diversity . Whether it be their height, their weight or colour of their hair, the models wanted to prove that it isn't always the obvious features that they are insecure about . The women took to the catwalk in T-shirts emblazoned with the question: 'What do you see?' and when they walked back, their inner most insecurity was displayed on the back of the top . The women took to the catwalk in T-shirts emblazoned with the question: 'What do you see?' and when they walked back, their inner most insecurity was displayed on the back of the top. Katie, who was left with severe scarring after being attacked in 2008 when her ex-boyfriend employed an accomplice to throw a cup of industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face, was keen to reveal hers. 'You might look at me and think that's what I would be insecure about it, but it isn't,' she revealed. 'In fact, it's my height; I would love to be a bit taller.' The shows, which starred models with visible differences, will also take place on March 21 and April 3 . The lady in a wheelchair then took to the catwalk with a T-shirt explaining her true insecurity . Katie, who penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success and she no doubt passed that advice on in today's show . Explaining the inspiration behind the show's name, Katie said: 'It's called Confidence - The Secret because confidence is something you can use to express yourself and convey yourself and it's something I've used through several periods of my life. 'It's not about trying to look and be perfect, it's about a positive mindset and being the best version of yourself that you can possibly be.' Katie, who  penned several positive affirmation books during her recovery, says an optimistic outlook is one of her secrets to success. 'I can't express how important positive thinking is,' she said. 'When I was recovering from my attack, I would write lots of little powerful notes and stick them around the room. Before I walk onto the red carpet, I have a mantra and always repeat to myself "inhale confidence, exhale doubt"; it really is so powerful. 'It's all about looking at what you do have and not what you don't.' This model, an amputee, revealed that she hates her wide hips as she walked the runway . Katie heeded her own advice recently when she took to the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'. Her catwalk coup kicked off what looks set to be a successful year for Katie. She's penning a new book, due out later this month, is working on a third series of Bodyshockers and has been busy growing her charity. If that wasn't enough, Katie is planning her wedding, mothering her one-year-old daughter and training for a triathlon, too. She added: 'No matter what you look like, you can live a full life and that's what I want to show with Confidence - The Secret.' Last month, Katie rocked the runway for Naomi Campbell's Fashion For Relief catwalk show, which she describes as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'
