All article text:The NFL have fined the Atlanta Falcons and stripped them of a draft pick  following the team's use of fake crowd noise at home games. In a statement released on Monday, the league announced that the Falcons have been fined $350,000 (£237,000) and will forfeit their fifth-round selection in the 2016 draft. If the Falcons have multiple picks in that round, the highest selection will be forfeited. Team president Rich McKay has also been suspended from the league's Competition Committee beginning April 1. Atlanta Falcons have been fined £237,000 for their use of fake crowd noise at the Georgia Dome . Owner Arthur Blank acknowledged the team's wrongdoing and described the incident as embarrassing . The NFL noted throughout the 2013 season and into the 2014 season the Falcons violated league rules that state 'at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium.' The league also said Roddy White, the team's former director of event marketing, was directly responsible for the violation and would have been suspended without pay for the first eight weeks of the 2015 regular season had he still been with the club. The Falcons fired him. The league determined that Falcons ownership and senior executives, including McKay, were unaware of the use of an audio file with artificial crowd noise. But as the senior club executive overseeing game operations, McKay bears some responsibility for ensuring that team employees comply with league rules. McKay can petition Commissioner Roger Goodell for reinstatement to the committee no sooner than June 30. The Falcons played fake crowd noise during the 2013 and 2014 seasons . Falcons president Rick McKay has been suspended from his position on NFL Competition Committee . Falcons owner Arthur Blank said in early February that he had seen enough of the NFL's investigation to acknowledge wrongdoing by his club. 'It's not really a fine line,' Blank said. 'I think what we've done in 2013 and 2014 was wrong. Anything that affects the competitive balance and fairness on the field, we're opposed to, as a league, as a club and as an owner. It's obviously embarrassing but beyond embarrassing it doesn't represent our culture and what we're about.' The Falcons say 101 of 103 games have been sellouts since Blank bought the team in 2002. Actual turnouts declined during losing seasons the last two years. Atlanta ranked 10th among the 32 NFL teams with its average home attendance of 72,130 in 2014. Construction is underway for a new $1.4 billion stadium that will replace the Georgia Dome in 2017. The new stadium will have a similar seating capacity.

The Michigan State University graduate has worked as a teacher for 12 years, but felt she couldn't continue due to the hostile environment at the school. Sharon Moran, 47, says she retired because a middle school student threatened her life while she was teaching . Moran, who has taught for 12 years, was at McKinley Middle School in Albuquerque, New Mexico (pictured) The death threat was the final straw in Moran's decision to quit, KOAT reported. Administrators from Albuquerque Public Schools did not respond 'correctly to the threat that was made', according to Moran. She said: 'I do feel like I'm being intimidated and I feel like I'm bullied. 'I had to kind of evaluate every day what kind of situation I'm going into every day and whether or not I'm safe. 'My family is concerned for my safety. 'They worry about me and I think I did the right thing.' In an earlier incident at McKinley, a male teacher, 71, was hurt while breaking up a fight between two students . During an incident at McKinley earlier this year, a 71-year-old male teacher was hurt while breaking up a fight between two students. Vincent Criscuola, a special education teacher, was punched and thrown into a wall during the incident. Criscuola had to take time off after suffering a spinal strain, a neck sprain and a hip injury. However, he did decide to return to the school despite admitting, 'I don't feel safe there'. He said: 'It just upsets me. 'We're there to teach and take care of these kids and watch out for their safety.' The principal and vice principal at McKinley have not responded to a request for comment.

All article text:The Nigerian military says it has destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza. The official Twitter account for the Nigerian Defense Headquarters announced 'FLASH: Troops this morning captured Gwoza destroying the Headquarters of the Terrorists self-styled Caliphate.' It followed with 'Several terrorists died while many are captured. Mopping up of entire #Gwoza and her suburbs is ongoing.' Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August. Earlier this month Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader. Liberators: The Nigerian military says its soldiers (pictured) have destroyed the headquarters of Boko Haram in the barbaric terrorist organisation's de facto capital city Gwoza . Breakthrough: The failure of President Goodluck Jonathan (left) to defeat Boko Haram has dogged Nigeria's leader as he stands for re-election tomorrow. It was not immediately possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement from Gwoza - but critics have questioned its timing . Goodluck Jonathan's opponents have said the offensive against Boko Haram is a political ploy ahead of tomorrow's election (a billboard for which is pictured). They have asked why Nigeria's military, of which Jonathan is the commander in chief, is suddenly is capable of doing what it has failed to do for six years . It was not possible to verify this morning's morale-boosting announcement, which comes just one day before critical presidential elections in Nigeria. The Twitter messages made no mention  of military operations in Sambisa Forest, where Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist group is believed to have several camps. Warplanes have been bombarding the area for weeks. The forest starts about 20 miles from Gwoza town, which is 80 miles southeast of Maiduguri - the Borno state capital state and Boko Haram's birthplace. Sambisa Forest is where extremists first took nearly 300 schoolgirls kidnapped from a boarding school in Chibok almost a year ago. Dozens escaped on their own but 219 remain missing. The failure of the government and military of President Goodluck Jonathan to rescue the girls created international outrage and continues to dog Nigeria's leader as he stands for re-election. Nigeria's military, with support of troops and military aircraft from neighboring countries, in the past two months has retaken dozens of towns from Boko Haram. This comes after months of defeat at the hands of Boko Haram, with soldiers fleeing the battlefield after they ran out of ammunition. Jonathan's opponents have said the offensive is a political ploy, asking why Nigeria's military, of which Jonathan is the commander in chief, is suddenly is capable of doing what it has failed to do for nearly six years. Brutal: Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau (pictured) declared the northeast Nigerian city to be the capital of a new Islamic caliphate after he seized the town in August . Earlier this month Boko Haram militants (pictured during a recent filmed beheading) pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, formally recognising Iraqi Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their spiritual leader . On the run: Civilians who fled the fighting in Bama and the surrounding areas in recent days gather a makeshift camp for displaced people on the outskirts of Maiduguri . Reports from the newly-liberated town of Bama say the city has been devastated by the militants' occupation and the efforts to re-take the city - with the army claiming the stench of death hangs heavy in the air. The devastation is visible from the air in Bama. Corrugated iron roofs lie ripped off among charred debris, the walls of the houses blackened with soot or in ruins. On the dusty roads that separate properties in the second-biggest town in Borno state, northeast Nigeria, the sight -- and smell -- is much worse, with evidence of atrocities everywhere. The Nigerian military forced out Boko Haram from Bama earlier this month. As they did so, locals who managed to escape said the Islamists set fire to homes, including the emir's palace. But clearly much worse happened -- and the evidence is on the streets, beneath them and in the parched fields beyond. Troops found the decomposing body of a man in a sewer, in the fetal position surrounded by trash and human waste. Soldiers cover their noses as more remains are found elsewhere. Nigerian troops celebrate after taking control of Bama from Boko Haram militants earlier this week . Nigerian troops are seen taking up positions in the northeast Nigerian town of Bama earlier this week . Reports from the newly-liberated town of Bama say the city has been devastated by the militants' occupation and the efforts to re-take the city - with the army claiming the stench of death hangs heavy in the air . Earlier this week it emerged that Boko Haram had abducted hundreds of women and children  from primary schools  to use them as 'human shields'. The Islamic militants took adults and children from primary schools in the north-eastern town of Damasak as troops from Niger and Chad approached a month ago, Mike Omeri, the Nigerian spokesman for the fight against Boko Haram, confirmed this week. When the soldiers arrived, they found the town largely deserted - with local reports suggesting as many as 500 people were taken in the raids. Mr Omeri refused to be drawn on exactly how many people had been taken by Boko Haram militants, but he was clear on the reason why they had been kidnapped. 'Boko Haram ... rushed to primary schools they took children and adults that they are using as shields to protect themselves from the menacing advance of troops,' he said. 'They are being used as shields by Boko Haram.' Damasak, which is near the border with Niger and had been held by Boko Haram for months, was recaptured on March 16 - but officials have only confirmed the kidnappings now. Evidence of a mass grave was also discovered by the troops from Chad and Niger, who now hold the town, Chad's ambassador to the U.N. Mahamat Zene Cherif confirmed Wednesday. Kidnapped: As many as 500 women and children were taken from Damasak, in north-eastern Nigeria, as Chadian troops (pictured) advanced on the town, which had been held by Boko Haram for months . Defence: Officials believe they were taken so they could be used as human shields when troops arrived. Pictured: Chadian army celebrates entering Damasak - showing off one of Boko Haram's flags . Last week, the troops found the bodies of at least 70 people in an apparent execution site under a bridge leading out of Damasak, which had been used as an administrative centre for the extremists who hope to create their own 'caliphate' in the region. The six-year battle against the insurgents is one of the major issues voters will be considering on Saturday. Thousands have already lost their lives - including an estimated 10,000 last year alone - while more than 174,000 people are thought to have fled to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and Niger as refugees. Analysts attribute the success to newly acquired war materiel including tanks, armored cars and helicopter gunships, training by foreign instructors and a joint offensive with battle-hardened soldiers from neighboring Chad, as well as troops from Niger and Cameroon. A regional offensive against Boko Haram was mounted at the end of January amid growing international concern as Boko Haram seized territory the size of Belgium. The terror group also pledged to become the West Africa franchise of the Islamic State group operating in Syria and Iraq, and as the Nigerian insurgents spread their attacks across borders. At least 10,000 people were killed in the Islamic uprising last year and more than 1.5 million people have been driven from the homes.

The pictures, published in a tabloid newspaper, were taken after the Scotland captain had allegedly spent Wednesday night drinking with friends in lap-dancing bars in the capital. Brown was also shown eating fast food in the photographs, flying in the face of manager Ronny Deila’s instructions to his players to be ‘24-hour athletes’.

Celtic refused to comment on the reports but Sportsmail understands the Parkhead club are playing down the seriousness of the incident after Deila gave his squad Thursday off. Brown, who has made 42 appearances for his country and is just eight caps away from entering the SFA’s hall of Fame, returned to training on Friday ahead of Sunday’s clash with Dundee United at Hampden. The Scottish Sun reported that Brown was in the Burke and Hare nightclub where he enjoyed the attention of scantily-clad girls and offered to buy dances for fellow drinkers. But he was reported to have had an argument with some of the dancers and a barman had to intervene to calm the situation. Brown then left for the Western Bar where he was refused entry but was successful in getting into the nearby Baby Dolls lap-dancing bar.

All article text:Famed radio presenter John Laws has again shocked listeners after he berated an elderly man who began to break down on air as he revealed  he was sexually abused as a child. During the interview on Thursday morning Mr Laws called the elderly man - known as Brian - a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade, for god sake'. Scroll down for video . Mr Laws has come under fire after mocking an 80-year-old sexual assault victim . In the ten minute chat Brian recounted several instances where he was sexually abused when he was only eleven and fourteen years of age. Mr Laws quipped and chuckled that it 'took a little while for you to get around to talk about it.' Brian then told Mr Laws that he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to 'go away and forget about it. No one would do anything about it.' It was at this stage Mr Laws added insult to injury as he told 80-year-old Brian that he should have fought the man off, as he himself had done when men had 'had a go' at him when he was younger. The disgraced shock jock called the elderly man a 'wet blanket' and suggested he should 'go to the pub and have a lemonade, for god sake'. 'Did you scream in fright? Did you yell out 'stop that you bastard'? Did you lash out with your fists? Did you hit him?' Laws asked. A meek sounding Brian responded 'no, no probably not.' 'I don't quite understand why you didn't lash out, you would have been a fairly big boy by that time. Didn't you kick or yell or scream or hit?' Mr Laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss, who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults. Brian began to become audibly distressed at this stage when he explained he had no family support. 'No, we never had any uh, there was no such thing as ... family love,' Brian said. He explained that his abuse was a contributing factor to why he had no girlfriend, no romantic interests and very little human contact. Repeat offender: Mr Laws was criticised in 2013 after telling a female sexual assault victim that women who dress provocatively are 'rapebait' Mr Laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest. Brian responded that he was 'sad more than anything.' Mr Laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of 'both of their time.' Brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks, trying to minimise human contact when Mr Laws thought it prudent to offer Brian some more sound advice. In a flood of support for Brian many twitter users have called for Mr Laws to be sacked . 'Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, why don't people like me? 'You're not the happiest soul, I don't know that you'd make people who are around you feel all that good. Have you tried to brighten up a little? Difficult I know. 'Do you hear me? But you're not taking any notice. 'You've got to be responsible for your own activity. You must make the move, go and talk to somebody about it.

'But don't be down all the time, don't be a wet blanket all the time. Try and have a laugh.' 'No? Well there's not a lot more I can do, is there?' To wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation Mr Laws asked Brian to thank him for his time. 'Brian, could you say thank you?' The interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation Mr Laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse. Mr Laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were 'rape bait'. Twitter has erupted in support for Brian as listeners call for the so-called radio magnate to be sacked. The twitter community rushed to condemn the actions of Mr Laws labelling him a 'monster' Sarah Monahan, the former co-star of Hey Dad! who was among actor Robert Hughes’ child sex abuse victims, chimed into show support for Brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care. She added Mr Laws needs 'genuine help' after listening to the insensitive call. Sarah Monahan wants Brian to know that he isn't alone and people do care . Karen Willis from NSW Rape Crisis Centre is among critics who say Mr Laws should be taken off the air. 'That man needs to hang up his hat,' she told Daily Mail Australia. She said the manner in which Brian was publically cut down after he had the 'courage to speak up' was 'completely irresponsible and unacceptable'. 'Brian, could you say thank you?': Mr Laws insisted Brian thank him at the end of the awkward conversation . ‘What we know  is that 40 years ago child sexual assault was rarely talked about. Children were told they made and any attempt they made to tell someone would have quite often  been met with rejection, punishment or blame,’ she added. 'After a lifetime of living with fear, to hear somebody they trust and respect to speak to them like that. It just reinforces a life of thinking it was their fault. It's just awful.’

Dozens of Stars and Stripes flags, as well as symbols of the Nato military alliance, thronged the capital of the Czech Republic as American soldiers were given a warm welcome by the locals. Armored carriers, including Stryker multi-purpose fighting vehicles, rolled down the highways before coming to a temporary stop in the city's historic streets as part of an overt show of strength to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Scroll down for video . Armored column: Row on row of American firepower rolled through Prague today as Stars and Stripes filled the air . Warm welcome: Locals turned out in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, and waved the Stars and Stripes and the blue flag of Nato as a welcome to visiting U.S. troops . Show of strength: A huge column of armored might has been working its way through Eastern Europe and the Baltic States in the past week as a show of strength in the region . Route: The U.S. armored column began in three different locations before converging in Prague. It will finish in Germany . Are you watching, Vlad? The U.S. Army's Stryker armored assault vehicles, above, were supported by Air Force fighter jets and Army attack choppers for parts of the route . The armored column is headed to an army base in Vilseck, Germany, in a journey spanning more than 1,000 miles. The troops are travelling through Nato member states, including the Czech Republic, in the wake of fears over Russian military intervention in the region. They were given similarly enthusiastic receptions in other European cities. States in the Baltic feel at particular risk as they share a border with Russia. The convoy, part of a mission dubbed Atlantic Resolve, is designed to reassure members and demonstrate that Nato is prepared to defend its member states. Ukraine, which had its Crimea territory annexed by Russia last year, and claims military intervention is ongoing, applied to join Nato in 2008, but the process was never completed. Under the rules of the alliance, any attack on a member state is regarded as an attack on all of them, a tenet credited with checking Soviet expansion during the Cold War. Happy to see them: Czech locals were pleased to see an American military presence as fears continue over Russia's military action in the region . Bringing the sunshine: The overt military operation is designed to reassure Eastern Europe that the U.S. is ready to act . Shaking hands: A Czech man approached an Army reconnaissance vehicle to greet a soldier in person . Big guns: The U.S. has rolled its heavy arms more than a thousand miles from Estonia, with an eventual destination of Germany . The Dragoon Ride convoy began in three separate branches; one in Talinn, Estonia, one in Vilnius, Linthuania and one in Drawsko Pomorskie, Poland. They converged in Prague and will continue along a single route to Germany, where the U.S. Army has a base. The convoy has in parts received air support from U.S. Air Force jet planes and Army attack helicopters. Supporters of Russia had threatened to disrupt - or even halt - the convoy, but local reports say that agitators were far outnumbered by supporters and that no untoward incidents took place. An army spokesman said: 'Dragoon Ride is a complex mission involving a significant amount of international diplomatic and military cooperation. 'It will allow all units involved an opportunity to exercise key command and control systems across all levels of command, test their unit leadership and maintenance capabilities, while simultaneously providing a highly-visible demonstration of U.S. commitment to its NATO allies and demonstrating NATO’s ability to move military forces freely across allied borders in close cooperation.' Lining the streets: Crowds are pictured above earlier in the mission, waving in support from the Czech border . Waving: Soldiers in heavy camo waved to the crowds on their long journey . 'Stay with us!': The message from these Czech supporters was unambiguous amid fears over Putin's Russia . Air support: Army helicopters hovered overhead parts of the march, pictured above in Drawsko Pomorskie, Poland . Local flavor: An U.S. soldier hands a beer to a colleague as they pause in Prague on their long journey .

All article text:(CNN)I am atheist -- and I am black. Yes, we exist -- even if many in the media sometimes don't notice us. In a CNN special that aired on Tuesday, for example, people of color were not as well-represented as American atheism's more familiar face: You know, white males. In fact, African-American atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of American atheists at large. Does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just don't gravitate towards nonbelief, or are there other factors which keep us hidden? There is a harsh truth to face here. Most blacks identify as religious. Belief in God is touted with pride, and the church is intricately tied to tradition, history and culture. It is not uncommon to assume that I attend services as a black woman. The question often isn't if I go to church -- it's where. And even if one doesn't go to church, surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god. All of this makes the words "black" and "atheist" hard for many to imagine in the same sentence. It can be extremely difficult to discuss religion objectively in the black community. Many have social, emotional and financial stakes invested in this institution, so for one to even say they have doubts is like committing treason. To openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible, and good luck finding other blacks who also don't believe. It is very important to note however, that the Internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other, and there is a large community of us online. Though I was raised secular -- a rarity in my community -- I've had to endure ostracism from family and friends as a result of openly identifying as an atheist. However, my journey is far from tragic. In founding my organization, Black Nonbelievers, in 2011, I have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself, or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind. And they have done so bravely, defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion. The Friendly Atheists Next Door . My experience in the secular community as a black atheist has ranged from feeling totally welcome to feeling totally isolated, and even ignored. On the one hand, there is common ground shared -- our nonbelief and even discontent with religion unites us. On the other hand, there is a notion that since we share this common ground that there are no other issues to address. The lack of people of color at secular events is a problem -- partly because there is unawareness of such events existing, but also because there is limited effort placed in accommodation and care. We are sometimes treated as if we are invisible, or even as an afterthought -- which does not make the few persons of color feel welcome. Fortunately, all is not lost. Progress has been made. There are now a number of secular groups that have helped to bring about more diverse representation for people of color, women and children. There is a more concentrated focus on support for the LGBT demographic, as well for others who come from marginalized and disfranchised backgrounds. There are support systems for people who have lost loved ones, yet they have no religious affiliation. Moreover, there is a tremendous amount of literary and artistic talent. Such representation is now reflected at organized events, in leadership, as well as in media coverage. While the number of visible minority atheists is still small, we are here and we're here to stay. We will continue to grow, in both the black and secular communities. We can lead the charge for this change. The more we make our presence known, the better our chances of working together to turn around the disparities we face, and bolster the recognition we so rightly deserve. We are not alone.

All article text:A paleo cookbook for infants co-authored by My Kitchen Rules chef Pete Evans has been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. One recipe is a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - one of Evans' signature Paleo creations. Scroll down for video . Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The cookbook is the joint venture of celebrity chef Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way was marketed as 'simple, delicious paleo recipes for new mothers, babies and toddlers' by 'health crusaders' Carr,  Padarin and Evans, who 'have seen firsthand the positive impact a paleo way of eating has had on their families' wellbeing'. The greatest concern, especially given that none of the authors have medical qualifications, lie with the do-it-yourself baby formula, which is made primarily from liver and bone broth, reported The Australian Women's Weekly. Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . The broth reportedly contains ten times the recommended daily intake of Vitamin A for infants, but lacks other basic nutrients needed for sustenance. Professor Yeatman said that while adults have the choice to follow the paleo diet, which excludes dairy and grains, parents are responsible for the diet of their children and that it would be unfair for parents to force 'unproven' beliefs on them. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding. If the wrong decision is made, they may be seriously affected,' she said. Further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes, which contradicts national health guidelines. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. In July last year, the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) criticised the paleo diet, with the association's chief executive officer Claire Hewat labelling the Paleo diet was 'potentially dangerous' and evidence of its benefits 'just doesn't stack up'. The Paleo diet requires people to cut out 'grains, legumes, certain dairy products, conventionally-raised meats, non-organic produce, and genetically modified and processed foods', which Ms Hewart says is not practical for many Australians. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.' Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet, and has come under fire for some of his more controversial claims about the Australian food industry. Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism, taking aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA)  as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet. His fiery rant, which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet. Pan MacMillan has been contacted for comment.

All article text:With injuries piling up ahead of Scotland’s final Six Nations match against Ireland, Vern Cotter has identified a solution to his selection problem. ‘We will play the Under-20s against them,’ said the Scotland head coach in his laconic, deadpan style. ‘We had eight players injured against England. How many are doubts for the Ireland match? All of them.’ Jim Hamilton, seen here tackling England's James Haskell, is one of five doubts for the Ireland game . Such was the despondent air hanging over the Scotland head coach as he spoke in the bowels of Twickenham on Saturday evening, he could be forgiven for thinking the worst at the time. Thankfully, a Scottish Rugby Union medical bulletin issued on Sunday suggested it was five players — not eight — who will require further treatment ahead of the match at BT Murrayfield. Second row Jim Hamilton, who had to come off for a time after being concussed in the first half, then had to be replaced following a back spasm, is the biggest doubt to face Ireland. Matt Scott suffered a ‘dead leg’ with bad bruising and now faces a race against time to be ready. Alasdair Dickinson has a leg injury he picked up in a tackle, winger Tommy Seymour an elbow problem and flanker Blair Cowan a calf strain. The walking wounded will be excused training on Monday, with an SRU spokesman saying the medical team will be working with them over the next few days to try to ensure they can put some work in before the final Six Nations match. Vern Cotter was downbeat after the defeat, which came with a heavy price in terms of personell . Others who Cotter thought were more seriously hurt, such as Finn Russell, David Denton and Euan Murray, should be fit. ‘We have been unlucky with injuries, which hasn’t helped us,’ said Cotter, who lost Alex Dunbar in the build-up to the Calcutta Cup encounter. ‘Everybody has to be patient. We can turn the corner, come back strong and do well against Ireland. ‘Right now, we have to take that defeat to England on the chin and keep working, analysing what went wrong, what went right and moving forward. ‘I thought there were some real positive aspects for us in our game at Twickenham but we have Ireland next week and they beat England — so it will be very tough test.’ Cotter continues to insist his side are ‘heading in the right direction’ despite a fourth Six Nations defeat and a likely wooden spoon. Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw takes a heavy hit as he brings down Ben Youngs during the narrow defeat . VIDEO O2 Inside Line: England v Scotland match review . He praised his players for battling back against England after losing a fourth-minute converted try from Jonathan Joseph. ‘England based their strategy on starting well and they did just that,’ added Cotter. ‘What I saw from our team after that pleased me. I saw great character. They didn’t panic, got themselves back into the match and I got a message down to them to say don’t worry about it. ‘They also showed they could change tactics when needed, which is a great thing. ‘On top of that, I thought our line-out defence and our scrum, after the first one, was very good. ‘If I thought we were being dominated from start to finish I might worry but I don’t think we are. There is more to come from this team, no question.’ Captain Greig Laidlaw was instrumental in dragging Scotland back in the face of England’s early onslaught. He inspired those around him with his leadership qualities. Laidlaw admitted Scotland needed to be more intelligent with the ball, but praised his team's spirit . He gave the backs quick ball and put over two penalties and a conversion in a top-class display. Laidlaw admitted. ‘England came flying out the blocks but, once that happened, we had to deal with it. ‘The response I got from the guys was calm and controlled. ‘From then on, we played some magnificent rugby until half-time. In the second half, a couple of times there was a bounce of the ball that maybe went against us and the game just went away from us a little bit. We should know when to offload and when to hold the ball. ‘When we did get into their half, we put little kicks through when we should have held the ball. We need to learn that Test-match rugby is won by small margins.’

All article text:New York cops gave two teens jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn. Beanca Moise and Jo-Anna Thiboutot, both 16, were rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center on March 14 suffering multiple fractures and bruises after being struck by a car as they attempted to cross the street mid-block in a section of Flatbush Avenue, according to the New York Post. Moise said she thought the cops standing near her hospital bed, as doctors swarmed around her, were there to see if she was okay. Tickets: New York cops gave Beanca Moise (photographed) and Jo-Anna Thiboutot jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn . Instead, they were there to give her and Thiboutot tickets for jaywalking -- illegally or recklessly crossing the street without regard for approaching traffic. 'It was very insulting,' Moise told the Post. 'I got hit by a car, and they came to the hospital not even checking if I was okay, and just gave us the ticket.' The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians. They told the teens' parents that the tickets were mandatory given the mayor's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy. Mandatory: The cops told Moise's (photographed) and Thiboutot's parents that the tickets were mandatory given Mayor Bill de Blasio's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy . Thiboutot's mother, Rose Benjamin, was handed the teen's summons as her daughter was being treated for deep bruises and gashes on a hospital stretcher. The accident reports and the girls' summonses blame the teens for running into traffic because the girls were attempting to cross the street mid-block, the Post reports. Each summons was signed by one 63rd Precinct cop, a 'PO Nagle.' The driver, Edwin Lawrence, did not receive a summons because a witness reportedly told police Lawrence had the right of way. Jaywalking summonses have risen to 2,000 a year since the mayor implemented the crackdown, according to the Post. The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor de Blasio's (center) Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians . 'Crackdown:' Wiley Norvell, a spokesperson for City Hall, took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown' The girls' families plan to fight the summons and sue the driver. They hired lawyer Michael Goldberg who questioned why the officers had to hand-deliver the tickets to the girls while they were being treated at the hospital, the Post reports. Weeks after the incident, Moise remains on crutches and reportedly needs two more months to recover from fractures and bone contusions. Though the officer's held that they were simply following orders in delivering the 'mandatory' tickets, Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for City Hall, told Gothamist that there is 'no such thing as a 'zero tolerance' policy on jaywalking.' 'Enforcement decisions are made precinct by precinct as commanding officers see fit, based on conditions they see on the ground,' he said. Serious Injuries: In 2014, an elderly man, Kang Wong, suffered serious head injures as NYPD cops attempted to arrest him after stopping the man for jaywalking in the city's Upper West Side . Norvell stated that five jaywalking tickets are issued each day adding that 100 are given for failure to yield. Norvell took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown.' The city saw an increase in jaywalking tickets shortly after the mayor implemented the Vision Zero plan in 2014. With Police Commissioner Bill Bratton embracing the mayor's plan, the New York Police Department issued more than 400 jaywalking tickets in the first two months of 2014 -- compared with just 50 the year before, the Post reports. The jaywalking 'crackdown' provided tickets to many New Yorkers last year, Meanwhile de Blasio and his security detail were caught on video jaywalking. In 2014, an elderly man, Kang Wong, suffered serious head injures as NYPD cops attempted to arrest him after stopping the man for jaywalking in the city's Upper West Side.

All article text:Bill Badger was a hero even before he helped save people's lives during the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting in a grocery store parking lot that killed six people and injured 13, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. The Army veteran died Wednesday morning of pneumonia, according to his wife, Sallie Badger. He was 78 years old. Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. Loughner is serving seven consecutive life terms in prison. Remembered: In this November 8, 2012 file photo, Bill Badger points his hand in the shape of a gun as he describes the events of the day Jared Loughner killed six people and wounded 13 others, following Loughner's sentencing to life in prison at U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona . Shooting: Bill Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. A memorial plaque for the shootings is seen on January 8, 2014 . Giffords, who lives in Tucson, said she was sad to learn of Badger's death. She said in a statement 'I'm so sad to learn that Bill Badger has passed away. Bill was not only a great man and a proud Army veteran, he was a hero. On January 8, 2011, Bill was wounded in the head by a bullet from the gun of my would-be assassin. Not even pausing to realize he had been injured, Bill ran towards the shooter and towards danger so that he could help subdue him until the authorities arrived. I believe that Bill helped save lives that morning. And I will always be grateful to him for his selfless, brave actions. 'My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with Bill's loved ones as they mourn the loss of a great man.' Shooter: Jared Loughman is now serving seven consecutive life terms in prison . Rep. Ron Barber also released a statement, which said in part 'The label "hero" an be overused, but Bill was undoubtedly one of the true heroes when a gunman opened fire at the shopping center on January 8, 2011. Although he had been grazed by a bullet and was bleeding from his head, Bill disregarded his own well-being and joined two others to stop the gunman. 'Six people died that day and 13 others of us were wounded — but the toll would have been much higher had not Bill taken fast action when the gunman paused to reload. I will forever be grateful for his bravery and the lives he saved.' Sallie Badger said it came as no surprise that her husband had risked his life to help others. The retired Army colonel had spent his entire life doing just that, she said. 'Bill was a hero to many, many people long before he became a hero on Jan. 8. He was very influential in many, many young lives in many ways,' Sallie Badger said. She said Badger was highly involved in the life of their 25-year-old son, Christian Badger. Badger also guided young men into the military and other careers, she said. Bill Badger hailed from South Dakota. He joined the National Guard as a high school junior and went on to have a long, distinguished career as an Army pilot for 37 years. The couple moved to Arizona in 1985 when Bill Badger established the Western Army Aviation Training Site in Marana, just outside of Tucson. On January 9, 2011, Badger told KOLD 'The shooting stopped and I raised up and didn't realize it, but he was right beside me. Right in front of me. And I got to my feet and one of the individuals who was there to see her was on the other side of the walkway, you know, right where he was walking and that individual took a folding chair, folded it and hit him on the back of the head and he moved his head forward so much of the blunt of it came right on the shoulders of his back and when they did that his left arm came out and it was my opportunity. 'I grabbed his left arm and started to twist it back and grabbed him on the shoulder with my right hand another individual grabbed his right hand and together we pushed on him and he went right down on the sidewalk. 'I had a hold of his throat and the guy on the other side had his knee right on the back of his neck, and every time he would struggle, I would squeeze his throat and the guy would put pressure on the back of his neck.' Badger was not permanently injured from the bullet that grazed the back of his head, but he showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, his wife said. The couple embarked on a three-year journey across the country to push for stricter gun laws. 'We wanted desperately to have background checks on every gun that was sold,' Sallie Badger said. 'And Bill just made that his mission.' Assassination: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is seen in this January 5, 2011 file photo - three days before the shooting took place . In this image released by the Pima County Sheriff's department, police notes, including naming Jared Loughner as a suspect and detailing weapons found at the scene, are seen scrawled on the trunk of a police vehicle during the aftermath of the Tucson shooting rampage . Legacy: Badger joined the National Guard as a high school junior and went on to have a long, distinguished career as an Army pilot for 37 years. He is seen with his wife Sallie Badger on August 7, 2012, after Loughner entered a plea agreement which sent him to prison for the rest of his life .

More than 33,000 shoppers have signed up on Facebook to participate in the giant maze-like store in Tempe, inner west of Sydney on Saturday, May 23. The event will begin from 1pm and within 10 minutes from the starting time, players are encouraged to hide in wardrobes, storage units and underneath piles of soft toys. But the Swedish retailer has put a stop to the unofficial event after attracting tens of thousands of participants, claiming the game 'raises security issues for both customers and co-workers.' Furniture giant IKEA has banned people from playing one of the most-loved childhood games - hide and seek . More than 33,000 shoppers have signed up on Facebook to participate in the giant maze-like at a Sydney store . 'As many of you may have heard, there are a couple of large hide-and-seek games being planned for IKEA stores in Australia,' IKEA said in a statement. 'While the prospect of seeing many of you trying to camouflage yourselves among the meatballs has its appeal, we are unfortunately unable to host or support these games. 'Due to the level of interest these games attract we would not be able to guarantee everyone’s safety and the threat this poses to our co-workers, customers and game participants is just too great. We would still love to have you visit – no need to hide!' But the Swedish retailer has put a stop to the unofficial event after attracting tens of thousands of participants . However, the organisers of the event have set out  rules ahead of the game, with each player expected to pay an entry fee of one dollar. The last person left unfound will walk away with the prize pool money but in an event, if all players are discovered, the money will be donated to a charitable cause, the organisers claim. Other rules include restrictions to hiding such as 'do not hide in fire escapes' and 'do not hide in toilets.' The ban comes after Amsterdam IKEA in Eindhoven were forced to cancel the bizarrely popular event . Hundreds have expressed their interests, with many saying they will travel from interstate to take part in the giant hide and seek event. The ban comes just a week after Amsterdam IKEA in Eindhoven were forced to cancel the bizarrely popular event citing safety concerns. The idea of using an Ikea store for an adult game of hide and seek has been mooted for years, given the furniture stores' abundance of adult-sized hiding places.

All article text:Shocking photographs showing the bloody beheading of four alleged spies in Iraq have been released by Islamic State. The images, given the disturbing title 'Harvesting of Spies', were taken in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin and published on social media. According to the captions, the four men were accused of being spies for the Baghdad government and had been condemned to death by an Islamic court. Depraved: The images of the execution were taken in the Iraqi province of Salahuddin and published on social media . Unusually for an ISIS public execution, no residents appear to have been allowed to witness the killings, despite them being carried out in a public place . Kneeling in matching black jumpsuits, the four alleged spies are shown with their hands tied behind their backs. ISIS fighters, three with their faces covered with balaclavas and another wearing a baseball cap, are pictured posing behind their victims with sharp knives. An ISIS official, carrying a machine gun and with his index finger pointing to the sky, is shown coordinating the execution. Dressed in a long tunic and wearing a head scarf, the man appears to be a local ISIS governor or judge. The bearded official steps back and at his command, the four prisoners are beheaded on the tarmac road. Alleged spies: The four men were accused of being spies for the Baghdad government and had been condemned to death by an Islamic court . Kneeling in matching black jumpsuits, the four alleged spies are shown with their hands tied behind their backs . Unusually for a public ISIS execution, no residents seem to have been allowed to witness the killings, despite it being carried out in a public place. The final two photos - too graphic to publish - show the severed heads of the victims. Just last week, footage was released of nine men being executed by ISIS for allegedly being spies. Each man was forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group's location, movement and armament. All nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads. Senseless: Last week, ISIS released footage of nine men being executed for allegedly spying on the terrorists . Forced confessions? Before their deaths, each man claims responsibility for spying on ISIS, although it is unknown whether they are speaking under duress . They pull the triggers without hesitation, sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground. The masked ISIS commander who introduces the senseless propaganda video says the men 'were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah'. The graphic footage, filmed in an unknown location in the Middle East, ultimately shows the deceased captives resting perfectly still in a shallow pool of blood. It was the second video of an ISIS execution to surface last week following the brutal mass murder of eight 'informers'. The terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in Syria and Iraq. Murdered: Militants claim the eight men were informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS .
