All article text:U.S. narcotics agents with Top Secret clearances had wild 'sex parties' with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartel members, according to a blockbuster report from the Justice Department's internal investigations arm. The Drug Enforcement Agency has yet to comment on the findings in the exposé from the DOJ's Office of Inspector General. At least seven DEA agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments. But instead of firing or prosecuting them, the agency treated their cases as a 'local management issue' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days. The IG cautioned in the report, released Thursday morning, that U.S. law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex – even in places where it's legal or unofficially tolerated – can be vulnerable to 'coercion, extortion, and blackmail.' The Republican chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the Justice Department after the report surfaced online, calling its allegations 'truly stunning.' 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . TROUBLE IN COLOMBIA: Drug Enforcement Agency officers had hooker parties allegedly paid for with drug cartel money . NARCO-PERVS: DEA agents had Top Secret clearances when they went on sex romps with hookers . 'We need to hold them accountable and, given the clear evidence in the OIG report, they should be fired immediately,' he said of the offending agents. 'We need to weed out those who risk our national security, embarrass the county, and skirt the law.' Chaffetz promised that his panel, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'will pursue this vigorously' after next week's congressional recess. In all, the IG report flagged 621 cases where agents in the FBI, DEA, ATF and U.S Marchalls Service were accused of a wide variety of sex-related offenses. They ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates. In the prostitudion cases, the IG wrote, 'DEA supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue' even though the 'these special agents held Top Secret clearances.' One case involved agents 'patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting. ... It was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors’ group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute.' 'The Acting Assistant Regional Director who supervised the two special agents in this case,' investigators wrote, 'was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... In that case, the AARD allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the AARD’s honor.' 'There were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated.' In all, six hookers attended that soiree. Supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the DOJ for disciplinary action. A tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents, claiming in an anonymous letter to DEA higher-ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour-of-duty assignments. In a separate case, the inspector general describes DEA agents who attended prostitute 'sex parties arranged by a Colombian law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves. The parties, the IG said, happened in the agents' government-leased apartments over a period of several years. Agents' laptops, BlackBerry devices, and other government-issued equipment were typically lying around, creating 'potential security risks' and potentially making agents vulnerable to 'extortion, blackmail, or coercion.' Foreign officers later claimed they held on to the American agents' guns  while they were indulging in the hooker-fests. They also claimed they gave three DEA supervisory agents 'money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.' Ultimately, 7 of the 10 agents the IG interviewed admitted taking part in the 'sex parties.' They were suspended for between 2 and 10 days, but never prosecuted criminally. Overall, the DEA limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days, in part because Colombian authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade. 'The DEA Inspector told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called "tolerance zones",' the GI wrote. 'According to the Inspector, it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers.' ANGRY: 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz . The DOJ's inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals Service, including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors . The U.S. Marshalls Service also got a black eye in the inspector general report. In one 2010 case described in detail, two deputy marshalls traevled to Thailand to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the United States. Every time the State Department tried to contact one of the men, one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he couldn't be disturbed. 'A local investigator for the State Department spoke to one of the women in Thai' and 'confirmed she was a prostitute,' the IG wrote. When he got home, the deputy was forbidden to travel overseas again. But he fuond a way to conduct at least one more extradition mission anyway and kept his security clearance. A nother deputy 'entered into a romantic relationship' with the spouse of a fugitive criminal suspect. When his supervisors told him to break off the fling, it took him a year to do it. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was relatively unscathed by the IG investigation, with one glaring exception. An ATF Director of Industry Operations, investigators wrote, 'solicited consensual sex with anonymous partners and modified a hotel room door to facilitate sexual play.' Management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system; he insisted he had done it before with no problem. Separately, an FBI Assistant Section Chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues 'engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7-year period,' according to the report. His partners included 'foreign nationals, including prostitutes, strippers, students in his classes, and members of foreign law enforcement.'

All article text:A size 28 woman who was told she could die if she didn't lose weight has been crowned slimmer of the year - after shedding more than eight stone. Georgina Wallace, from Feltham, London, was told by the doctor treating her mother for a fatal heart attack that the 39-year-old faced the same fate if she didn't eat more healthily. Tipping the scales at 18 stone, Miss Wallace, a marketing manager, said food was her only comfort  after her father was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, and her mother died. Scroll down for video . Georgina Wallace (pictured weighing 18 stone, left, and 10 stone, right) has been named Slimming World's Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2015 . Georgia couldn't contain her happiness today when she posed alongside a life size cut out of herself having lost a considerable amount of weight . She revealed she had been overweight since primary school but her weight spiralled out of control after losing both her parents in her mid-20s. Now, Miss Wallace has lost more than eight stone and says slimming down hasn't only changed her life, it's saved her life. And she has been rewarded for her hard work, as she was today named Slimming World's Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2015 for the work she does to help other people to lose weight. Miss Wallace said: 'I was 26 when my dad was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, then a year later my mum had a heart attack and died just days later. 'My world was completely thrown upside down and food was my only comfort.' While her mother was in intensive care Georgina received some frank words from the doctor caring for her mother. She said: 'He explained that the main reason my mum was lying in that hospital bed at just 59 years old was her weight. 'He warned me that I was heavier than her and, if I carried on the way I was going, would probably not even reach her age. Those words will stay with me forever.' Georgina larked about with her cardboard cut out, throwing it the air as she was awarded her Slimmer Of The Year title . Georgina, pictured before the weight loss, piled on the pounds after both of her parents died . Georgina, pictured weighing 10 stone, now fronts her own Slimming World group, she says when she first joined she finally felt at home and was glad to find that nobody judged her . Following her mother's death, Miss Wallace nursed her father until he died 18 months later. Afterwards, with the doctor's warning still ringing in her ears, she tried slimming down and yo-yo dieted for more than seven years. While she managed to lose 7st at one point, she found the diets she followed didn't help her to change her relationship with food and she struggled to manage her weight in the long term. Name: Georgina Wallace . Age: 39 . Height: 5ft 5in/1.65m . Starting weight: 18st 3½lbs . Current weight: 10st 1½lbs . Weight loss: 8st 2lbs . Starting dress size: 28 . Current dress size: 10/12 . Date joined Slimming World: June 2010 . Date became a Slimming World Consultant: October 2013 . She finally joined Slimming World in 2010 after hearing about the club's Food Optimising eating plan from an ex-work colleague. 'We'd gone out for dinner and my friend ordered a huge plate of pasta with cheese on the top and even had a glass of wine, yet she told me she could have all of this with Slimming World and still lose weight,' she said. 'I looked up my nearest group as soon as I got home and joined the very next week. 'I was terrified of walking into a room full of strangers. I thought I'd be the biggest person there and worried everyone would judge me because of my size. 'I couldn't have been more wrong though; nobody was pointing or laughing or judging me and straightaway I felt like I was one of them. It was a magical feeling; I felt safe and I knew I belonged in that room.' Miss Wallace, who has been married to husband Mohamed for three years, began following the Food Optimising plan and discovered a love of cooking including whipping up her favourite homemade chilli con carne with rice. She also started slowly becoming more active by tracking her steps. Nowadays she walks around 20,000 steps a day including the 5km home from work and has taken up running, completing several 5km runs and one 10km run to raise money for charity. Since that first night Georgina's lost 8st 2lbs, dropping from 18st 3lbs to 10st 1lbs, and after previously wearing a dress size 28 she's now a size 10/12. Pictured before losing weight Georgina played with a dolphin while on holiday . Georgina said that she used food for comfort, saying that she would tuck in to her favourite dishes whenever she felt sad or angry . During this time she's also given up smoking. She says: 'For the first time in 30 years I am in control of my eating. 'I used to treat myself with food when I was happy and comfort myself with food when I was sad or angry. Everything I've achieved has shown me that I am a strong person and I don't need to use food as an emotional crutch anymore.' In October 2013, after losing nearly 7st, Georgina decided that she felt so passionately about the difference her own weight loss had made to her life that she wanted to help other people to slim down in the same way. She trained as a Slimming World Consultant and opened her own group in Hanworth, which she runs alongside her full-time job. Georgina started Slimming World first and then started to introduce exercise into her life, she now walks everywhere and has taken part in several runs . Miss Wallace said: 'I've been a Consultant for nearly 18 months now. Knowing that every week my members are changing their lives and I'm helping them to do that makes me so proud. 'They motivate and help me to stay on track in my own journey too, so this award is for them as well as me. 'I'm fitter and healthier – my doctor says I have 'perfect' blood pressure – than I have ever been in my life, so I always say that losing weight hasn't only changed my life it's saved my life. 'I would love to go back to the hospital and thank the doctor who looked after my mum because even though I didn't act on his words straightaway I never forgot them. 'My only regret is that my parents died before I took control of my weight, I know they'd be extremely proud of me though.' Miss Wallace's next challenge is to fulfil a lifetime ambition to scuba dive. She says: 'I have always loved the water but the fear of putting on a wet suit has always held me back. Now I've lost weight I feel like I can do anything so this is definitely top of my to-do list.' – ends – . Breakfast: .

All article text:(CNN)It's the day the music died. In the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, a small aircraft carrying Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson crashed a few miles from Mason City Municipal Airport, near Clear Lake, Iowa. Pilot Roger Peterson also died in the crash. The voice of the hit songs "Peggy Sue" and "That'll Be the Day" was silenced forever. A few months later, the Civil Aeronautics Board blamed the accident primarily on the pilot's lack of qualification and certification to fly solely by instruments and secondarily on an inadequate weather briefing. (PDF). Now, the National Transportation Safety Board, the successor to the aeronautics board, may be taking another look. The NTSB received a letter from aviation enthusiast L.J. Coon, a self-described retired pilot and aircraft dispatcher, asking it to look at other possible contributing factors to the crash. They include the aircraft's weight and balance calculations (for passengers, baggage and fuel), possible issues with rudder panels and possible carburetor Induction icing, Coon told CNN in an email. "You have gotten our attention," the NTSB wrote in February, saying it would examine the information he provided, Coon's email said. The NTSB never fully closes a case, but any petition to re-examine a crash needs to show that there is new information suggesting the original probable cause is incorrect, NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said. The agency has two months to review the petition and decide whether there's new information that would make it revisit the case. In 1959, Holly, Valens and Richardson were part of the Winter Dance Party, a tour that had started in Milwaukee and traveled to small cities in Minnesota and Iowa. The musicians had traveled in subfreezing temperatures in unheated buses, and people were getting sick. Holly booked the four-seat aircraft to fly to Fargo, North Dakota, where he planned to finally do laundry and rest in advance of the group's next concert in nearby Moorhead, Minnesota. Country legend Waylon Jennings, then Holly's bass player, gave up his seat to a sick Richardson. Jennings, who died in 2002 at age 64, was haunted by his decision for years to come. Dion and the Belmonts were also on the tour, but Dion gave up his seat on the plane after hearing the $36 per-person price tag. He was the only headliner not on the plane and the only headliner who didn't die that night. Fans remember 'the Day the Music Died' The crash has inspired generations of artists. Lou Diamond Phillips played Ritchie Valens (originally Valenzuela) in the 1987 hit movie "La Bamba." Gary Busey played Holly in the 1978 movie "The Buddy Holly Story." Don McLean, who was inspired by Holly's music, memorialized that day as "The Day the Music Died" in his 1971 song "American Pie."

All article text:(CNN)A Connecticut 17-year-old who was forced to undergo nearly six months of chemotherapy to treat Hodgkin lymphoma is in remission, her attorney said Monday. "Cassandra C.," as she is identified in court papers, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in September. Medical experts gave her an 85% chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy. Without it, doctors said at the time, she was likely to die within two years. After her diagnosis, the young woman and her mother missed follow-up appointments, prompting the hospital to contact the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. They were concerned it was a case of medical neglect. After an investigation, the department requested temporary custody of Cassandra. She was removed from her mother's home and placed with a relative. A judge then allowed her to return home under the supervision of Department of Children and Families on  condition  she agree to complete the recommended treatment. After two days of chemotherapy in November, Cassandra ran away for a week, according to court documents. When she returned home she said she wanted to discontinue the treatment. Her mother, Jackie Fortin, who said she is opposed to chemotherapy, said her daughter didn't want the treatment because she did not want to put the "poison" in her body. In December, a judge returned Cassandra to the custody of Department of Children and Families after hearing testimony from her attorney. She was admitted to Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. Doctors surgically implanted a port in Cassandra's chest to administer chemotherapy medications, which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them. Now, she has just two treatments left, according to her state appointed attorney, Josh Michtom, who said she is feeling well and she is in good shape as far as her health is concerned. "She's seen in her case the side effects weren't bad and she's been well treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment," he said. In January, he and an attorney for Cassandra's mother failed in their effort before the Connecticut Supreme Court to make the case that Cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decision. In a statement emailed to CNN on Monday, Department of Children and Families Commissioner Joette Katz said, "We are very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery. We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life." The agency has denied CNN's request to speak with Cassandra or her physicians. Michtom said he will return to juvenile court next week to try to persuade a judge that Cassandra should be returned to her mother's custody. He will argue she is no longer in imminent risk of harm from her illness and that she wants to complete her treatment. According to Michtom, Department of Children and Families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but hasn't. He said the department sees Cassandra as a flight risk. In the meantime, Cassandra is said to spend her days reading, watching TV and drawing. "The hospital is effectively jail," Michtom said.

All article text:A pilot who once flew with killer airman Andreas Lubitz yesterday spoke of how he flew the 'route of death' between Barcelona and Dusseldorf just two days after the Alps tragedy. Frank Woiton said he hugged each individual passenger as he boarded the plane and prepared to retrace the route taken by the ill-fated Germanwings jet. The father-of-two described a 'crazy mood' among the crew and passengers, saying 'you could read it in their faces'. Speaking to German newspaper Bild, the 48-year-old told of how he received a huge round of applause after he delivered an emotional speech before take off. Reassuring: Pilot Frank Woiton, who once flew with Andreas Lubitz (pictured), said he hugged each individual passenger as he boarded the plane and prepared to retrace the route taken by the ill-fated Germanwings jet . 'Sure, I will take your from Dusseldorf to Barcelona. You can rely on the fact that I want to sit this evening with my family at the dinner table,' he told passengers over the intercom. He added: 'People should see that in the cockpit there is also another human being.' Mr Woiton, who also volunteered to work the day after the crash when a number of Germanwings crew refused to fly, also described a flight he shared with Lubitz. 'I remember him well and I left my seat from time to time in the air to use the toilet. ‘When I flew with him he told me of his training and how happy he was. He said that he wanted to fly long-haul routes and become a captain. ‘He had mastered the plane very well, he had everything under control. That’s why I left him alone in the cockpit, to go to the toilet.’ His revelations came after a woman travelling on another Germanwings flight described how another pilot had gone above and beyond to reassure passengers. Britta Englisch wrote on the airline's Facebook page that the pilot on her domestic flight in Germany had greeted each passengers individually before making a speech in the cabin. The unnamed pilot, flying a Germanwings plane from Hamburg to Cologne the day after the crash, was met with applause after assuring passengers they would be coming home safe to their families. Admirable man: Britta Englisch wrote on Germanwing's Facebook page how her pilot had greeted each passengers individually before making a speech in the cabin, promising to get them home to their families . Translated from German, Mrs English writes: 'Yesterday morning at 8:40am, I got onto a Germanwings flight from Hamburg to Cologne with mixed feelings,' Englisch wrote on the Germanwings Facebook page. 'But then the captain not only welcomed each passenger separately, he also made a short speech before take off. Not from the cockpit — he was standing in the cabin.' 'He spoke about how the accident touched him and the whole crew. About how queasy the crew feels, but that everybody from the crew is voluntarily here.' 'And about his family and that the crew have a family and that he is going to do everything to be with his family again tonight.' 'It was completely silent. And then everybody applauded. I want to thank this pilot.' Loss: Relatives of the victims of the Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crash on Tuesday put down flowers at the memorial in Le Vernet, south-eastern France earlier today . Killer: Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is suspected of having deliberately piloted Germanwings flight 4U9525 into the mountain, killing all 150 people on board, including himself, in the worst air disaster in Europe in recent history . All 144 passengers, including two babies, 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives in the crash . 'He understood what everybody was thinking. And that he managed to give, at least me, a good feeling for this flight.' The story, posted by Mrs Englisch on Germanwings Facebook, has since become a social media hit, with nearly 300,000 likes and 17,000 shares. All 144 passengers, including two babies, 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crashed on Tuesday. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit of the Airbus  before setting the airliner's controls to descend into a rocky valley, obliterating the plane and killing all 150 people on board. Germanwings chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said those who died came from at least 13 different countries - with 72 German nationals and 49 people from Spain confirmed to have been on passenger lists for the plane. Today, investigators trying to piece together why Lubitz crashed the plane have revealed he tore up a doctor's sick note for the day of the disaster. Investigators revealed today that medical sign-off notes were found at Lubitz's home and Dusseldorf University Hospital confirmed he had been a patient there over the past two months, although it would not disclose his condition.

Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, 25, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting alongside Kurdish forces in the frontline village of Tel Khuzela in Syria. His coffin, which was draped in both the Kurdish flag and the Union Jack, was handed over to his father and uncle in a special ceremony on the Syria-Iraq border yesterday. Scroll down for video .

Soldiers turned out for the ceremony on the Syria-Iraqi border yesterday . Mr Scurfield's father (centre) and uncle (left) turned out for the ceremony, which saw hundreds of Syrian Kurds line the streets and wave brightly-coloured flags as the coffin was handed over to the family . Mr Scurfield, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was shot dead on March 2 while fighting against ISIS in Syria . Soldiers turned out to form a guard of honour during the procession, while hundreds of Syrian Kurds lined the streets and waved brightly-coloured flags. The former Royal Marine, described as a 'one-man army' who was 'very angry about the Middle East', was hit by mortar fire while battling alongside Kurdish forces near the Syrian city of Qamishli. He is believed to have flown to the region after becoming horrified by the atrocities carried out by ISIS and his fellow fighters said he was the first to volunteer for ambushes and assaults. Prior to his death, he recorded video footage of himself – dressed in army fatigues – in which he said: 'My name is Konstandinos Erik Scurfield. I came here on my own free will and I came here to help.' His family, who live in a detached former farmhouse in Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire, were devastated to hear of his death. They were under the impression that he had left Britain in November last year to provide 'medical and humanitarian support' as an expert in battlefield medicine. Shortly after his death, Mr Scurfield's father Chris and uncle travelled out to Syria to try and repatriate his body. A Kurdish women stands beside the body of Mr Scurfield and pays her respects. It is not known when his body will be returned to his hometown in South Yorkshire and the Foreign Office has been unable to confirm . Mr Scurfield's coffin was carried into an ambulance by Kurdish fighters, who had gathered to pay respect . Mr Scurfield's coffin, which was draped in both the Union Jack and Kurdish flags, was taken to Erbil in Iraq . Mr Scurfield's body was taken to the Syrian-Iraqi border by car before being handed over to his family . Mr Scurfield described yesterday's ceremony as 'overwhelming' and said it was 'very special and very comforting' to his family. His son's coffin was draped with the Kurdish and Union Flags and hundreds of people, including Kurdish fighters in the region, watched as it was loaded onto an ambulance to be taken to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield was stopped from joining Kurdish forces last October when he was still a serving Royal Marine. He had been training with the U.S. Marines in California when he made email contact with a Kurdish group and arranged to travel to the frontline. But he was stopped while trying to board a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul, a now well-known jumping off point for Syria, in October and questioned by the American authorities. His one-way ticket rang ‘alarm bells’, officials said, and his luggage, phone and laptop were examined. The Marine, who was known to be outraged by the atrocities committed by the fanatics of ISIS, was also questioned by police on arrival in the UK and then returned to his unit, 45 Commando, in Arbroath, Scotland. It is believed he left the Royal Marines just weeks later. At one point during the procession, a woman dressed in a headscarf offered Mr Scurfield's devastated father support, by pulling him close to her and kissing him on the head. According to the Kurdish Female Fighters page on Facebook, those who gathered at the ceremony chanted ‘slogans of heroism’ as Mr Scurfield’s body was handed back to his family. The group said the chants included: ‘Oh immortal martyr! We swear by your blood, your blood will never be left on the ground, we will take your revenge and we will never forget you. 'With our life and with our blood we are with you, oh martyr.’ Another post by the Facebook group said: ‘The body of British YPG fighter Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, is on the way back to UK. ‘You will never be forgotten, you will always live in our hearts. ‘RIP Hero.’ It is believed that it will be some time before the fighter's body is repatriated to the UK, due to paperwork, and the Foreign Office refused to comment on the matter. Mr Scurfield, who was known as Kosta to his comrades, is the first Briton to be killed while fighting ISIS - also known as Islamic State - in Syria. The former drama student had ambitions to become an actor before joining the Royal Marines, aged 21. However, he fled to Syria to fight alongside the Kurdish forces after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out by ISIS'. Hundreds of Kurdish women and soldiers turned out for the ceremony yesterday ahead of the repatriation . Mr Scurfield's father and uncle (above) took part in the ceremony yesterday during which their relatives body was handed back to them in a coffin. The body will now be taken to Iraq before being repatriated to the UK . Hundreds of Syrian Kurds attended a ceremony for Konstandinos Erik Scurfield yesterday (pictured), during which his body was handed over to his grieving father and uncle, who had travelled from Britain to the region . Kurdish fighters formed a guard of honour (above) to pay their respects to Mr Scurfield during the ceremony . Mr Scurfield is said to have fled to Syria last November to fight alongside the Kurds against ISIS after becoming 'horrified by the atrocities being carried out' by the terror outfit. He died in mortar fire on March 2 . Mr Scurfield's body was transported to Semalka Gate at the Syria-Iraq border ahead of yesterday's ceremony . His family, including archaeologist parents Chris and Vicci and his student sister Georgianna, said they were heartbroken but proud of him. In a statement following his death they said: 'His flame might have burned briefly but it burned brightly with love, courage, conviction and honour and we are very proud of him.' While high numbers of foreigners are known to have joined ISIS, around 100 Westerners - including several Britons - are thought to have travelled to fight alongside the Kurds. Last month, a 19-year-old serving British soldier was returned to his unit after joining the Kurdish peshmerga.

Supporters won't expect Louis van Gaal to be winning any silverware this season, but a top four finish is a must for a club that invested heavily in the summer. Is that now a realistic possibility, though? United haven't beaten a side currently in the top half of the Premier League since their home win against Liverpool in mid December last year. Manchester United face a testing final 10 games in the Premier League, they'll play all of their rivals . Louis van Gaal has won less than half of his games against side's in the top six of the Premier League . To make matters worse, they now face the prospect of playing four of the top six in their next five games (and all of them before the end of the season). With Liverpool just a point behind United in the league, and Tottenham a further two points behind them, Van Gaal knows he can't afford to slip up. His record against the top six, though, is not especially encouraging. A fortuitous win at Arsenal and comfortable victory against an out-of-form Liverpool are the only notable moments. Monday's FA Cup tie proves the Gunners will be no pushover and Liverpool are unbeaten in the league since their loss at Old Trafford in 2014. With just 10 games to go until the end of the campaign - half are away from home and half are against direct rivals - Van Gaal and his side will need to show considerably better form to secure Champions League football next season. After Angel di Maria's red card against Arsenal, United will be without their record signing for the next match . United will have to stop the league's most in-form striker when they face Tottenham in their next game . Tottenham (H) - Sunday March 15 . These two sides drew 0-0 at White Hart Lane earlier in the season but with the Premier League's most in-form striker among Spurs' ranks this will be a stern test for United, who will be without the suspended Angel di Maria. Liverpool (A) - Sunday March 22 . A formidable proposition for Van Gaal. Liverpool haven't lost in the league in three months and have won nine of their last 11 matches. Aston Villa (H) - Saturday April 4 . A month ago United fans would have considered this an easy win but Tim Sherwood has reinvigorated Villa, who have now won their last two games in all competitions. Liverpool have not lost a Premier League game since they were beaten by United in December 2014 . United still have to host their fiercest rivals, and Premier League champions, Manchester City . Manchester City (H) - Sunday April 12 . United lost to their rivals 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium, City aren't in the most convincing spell of form but they are the Premier League champions nonetheless. Chelsea (A) - Saturday April 18 . Away at the league leaders. This isn't a match Van Gaal can rely on getting anything from. Everton (A) - Sunday April 26 . Everton have struggled this season but Goodison Park is always a difficult place to go, as United know well from recent history. A trip to league leaders Chelsea will be arguably the most difficult challenge of United's season . Arsenal's win at Old Trafford in the FA Cup quarter-final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts . West Brom (H) Saturday May 2 . Arguably the easiest of their remaining games, but Tony Pulis will make sure West Brom don't go down without a fight. Crystal Palace (A) - Saturday May 9 . Alan Pardew's Palace are a force to be reckoned with at Selhurst Park. Arsenal can testify to that - the Gunners were fortunate to escape with three points when they visited and so will United. Arsenal (H) - Saturday May 16 . Arsene Wenger's side are in fine form and their win at Old Trafford in the FA Cup quarter-final suggests this will be a difficult match for hosts. Hull City (A) - Sunday May 24 . After an abysmal start to the season, Steve Bruce's side are finally finding some form and have only lost once in their last five matches.

All article text:As five years as Prime Minister David Cameron should have a decent stock of anecdotes to keep a room of voters entertained. But in an advert break for last night's TV election contest the Tory leader took the chance to perform his own party trick. In front of more than 100 voters and studio crew, he recited a verse from his favourite childhood song: Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West). Scroll down for video . David Cameron revealed the only song he knows the words to is Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West), before reciting the first verse . Initial reports that the Prime Minister had burst into song were disappointingly wide of the mark. During a break he told Sky News presenter Kay Burley how the chart-topping song by Benny Hill was the only one he could sing in full. She tweeted: 'Just heard from PM that he can sing Ernie and nothing else...' The Premier could not be persuaded to showcase this talent, but did prove his love of the song by reciting the first verse. Burley added: 'He didn't sing but he did recite 'you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground...' Mr Cameron's love of the song first emerged in 2006 when he appeared on Desert Island Discs and revealed it would be one of the songs he would take to the fictional island. 'This really just reminds me of my childhood,' he said at the time. 'When you are asked to sing a song, this is, I'm afraid, the only song whose words I can remember.' The private rendition for the audience in last night's TV studio might explain why he got a relatively easy time from them when the cameras went live. While Mr Cameron was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts, Mr Miliband faced a series of aggressive questions. Mr Cameron waves to the audience after taking questions in the first TV contest of the general election campaign . The Tory leader's first question from the audience was: 'What do you think are Ed Miliband's best qualities?' One of the few off-the-cuff questions from Burley to the PM was: 'Have you ever had three shredded wheat?' When Mr Miliband face the audience, he was first asked: 'You sound gloomy most of the time, are things really so bad?' Another asked: 'Do you not think that your brother would have done a better job? He was better qualified and better positioned.' Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband faced the wrath of voters - and Jeremy Paxman - last night as they were forced to defend their broken promises, judgement and ability to lead the country in the first prime-time TV contest of the general election. They were interviewed by Paxman for 18 minutes each, and also took questions from a studio audience with Ms Burley acting as moderator on the show broadcast on Sky News and Channel 4. This afternoon Ofcom had received 254 complaints  - all of which were about perceived bias against the Labour leader. It is thought they have been generated by a social media campaign sharing a link to the watchdog's website and urging people to complain. Jeremy Paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing Prime Minister David Cameron . An Ofcom spokesman said: 'We are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate.' A Channel 4 spokeswoman said it had received around 300 complaints, but was unable to say specifically what they were about. 'Both politicians, one of whom is likely to be the next Prime Minister, agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities. Neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to Channel 4,' she added. Labour insiders privately noted that they thought Burley 'intervened and followed up aggressively a number of times'. At one point Burley told Mr Miliband: 'That's a politicians answer there isn't it?' She also pressed him on the impact of his leadership victory over his brother David. When the Labour leader said family relations had been strained, Burley responded: 'Your poor mum.' In a series of posts on Twitter, Burley took on her critics. Hundreds of people have lodged complaints with TV watchdogs that Kay Burley and Jeremy Paxman were biased against Ed Miliband . You could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground, and the clatter of the wheels as they spun 'round and 'round. And he galloped into market street, his badge upon his chest, his name was Ernie, and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. Now Ernie loved a widow, a lady known as Sue, she lived all alone in Liddley Lane at number 22. They said she was too good for him, she was haughty, proud and chic, but Ernie got his cocoa there three times every week. They called him Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. She said she'd like to bathe in milk, he said, 'all right, sweetheart,' and when he'd finished work one night he loaded up the cart. He said, 'd'you want it pasturize? 'cause pasturize is best,' she says, 'Ernie, I'll be happy if it comes up to my chest.' That tickled old Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. Now Ernie had a rival, an evil-looking man, called Two-Ton Ted from Teddington and he drove the baker's van. Comedian Benny Hill pictured as Ernie receiving a ticket from a policeman . He tempted her with his treacle tarts and his tasty wholemeal bread, and when she seen the size of his hot meat pies it very near turned her head. She nearly swooned at his macaroon and he said, 'If you treat me right, you'll have hot rolls every morning and crumpets every night.' He knew once she sampled his layer cake he'd have his wicked way, and all Ernie had to offer was a pint of milk a day. Poor Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. One lunch time Ted saw Ernie's horse and cart outside her door, it drove him mad to find it was still there at half past four. And as he lept down from his van hot blood through his veins did course, and he went across to Ernie's cart and didn't half kick his 'orse. Whose name was Trigger, (Triggerrrrrrrr) and he pulled the fastest milk cart in the west. Now Ernie rushed out into the street, his gold top in his hand, he said, 'If you wanna marry Susie you'll fight for her like a man.' 'Oh why don't we play cards for her?' he sneeringly replied, 'and just to make it interesting we'll have a shilling on the side.' Now Ernie dragged him from his van and beneath the blazing sun, they stood there face to face, and Ted went for his bun. But Ernie was too quick, things didn't go the way Ted planned, and a strawberry-flavoured yogurt sent it spinning from his hand. Now Susie ran between them and tried to keep them apart, and Ernie, he pushed her aside and a rock cake caught him underneath his heart. And he looked up in pained surprise and the concrete hardened crust, of a stale pork pie caught him in the eye and Ernie bit the dust. Poor Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west. Ernie was only 52, he didn't wanna die, and now he's gone to make deliveries in that milk round in the sky. Where the customers are angels and ferocious dogs are banned, and the milkman's life is full of fun in that fairy, dairy land. But a woman's needs are many fold and soon she married Ted, but strange things happened on their wedding night as they lay in their bed. Was that the trees a-rustling? Or the hinges of the gate? Or Ernie's ghostly gold tops a-rattling in their crate? They won't forget Ernie, (Ernieeeeeeeeee) and he drove the fastest milk cart in the west.

A father has been left devastated after it was revealed two men who were arrested for burglarizing his home allegedly threw away the ashes of his daughter, who died 10 years ago. Joel Tuck arrived at his Franklin, Tennessee home on Monday to find that his back door was wide open and it's glass window had been broken. Two flat-screen TVs, several checkbooks and a bottle of liquor were stolen. But it was when Tuck realized a pink purse was missing that his heart dropped. The pink purse belonged to his daughter Whitney, who died in 2005 at the age of 19 after losing her battle with leukemia. Her ashes were kept in a box inside the purse, which had been her favorite. Franklin police arrested Jwyanza Weaver and Christopher Gengler in connection to the burglary. They are currently in custody. Both men are convicted felons and Weaver was on probation at the time of his arrest, according to the Tennessean. According to police, the two men drove to a gas station after burglarizing the home. It was there that Gengler threw away the pink purse into a trash can. For Tuck, who kept the purse in his room, the entire ordeal has felt like losing his daughter all over again. He said it will probably haunt him for the rest of his life. Scroll down for video . Franklin police said Christopher Gengler (left) and Jwyanza Weaver (right) drove to a gas station after burglarizing Tuck's home and threw away the pink purse that held Whitney's ashes inside .

'It gave me a sense of peace that she's still with me.' Whitney's ashes were stored inside a matte black wooden box. Also inside the purse was a second box, engraved with the name Duchess, that held the cremated remains of Whitney's puppy, who died shortly after her. Police searched a number of dumpsters for six hours but have still not located the pink purse. Chief Deborah Faulkner said the bag can be dropped off 'a police station, a fire station, or anywhere else someone will find them and call us,' no questions asked.

All article text:A couple narrowly escaped death in the East Village explosion when they left their uninsured and now-incinerated  apartment to pick up some cupcakes minutes before the blast. Sara Stringfield and her boyfriend Rob Torti, 36, had a fun romantic day planned to celebrate Sara’s 31st birthday. Never did the lovebirds expect that they'd lose thousands of dollars worth of clothing and electronic devices, irreplaceable sentimental items, zany costumes, and the home they were finally able to share together after dating long distance for almost half a year. Scroll down for video . All loved up: Sara Stringfield, 31, and Rob Torti, 36, pictured at their East Village home where Sara just moved after months of the pair dating long distance . Cupcakes saved her life!: Sara and her boyfriend Rob celebrated Sara's birthday on Thursday and went to get cupcakes at Baked by Melissa just minutes before the giant explosion in the East Village . When Rob met Sara at the festival Burning Man in Black, Rock City Nevada in August of 2014 she set his heart on fire and the two began visiting one another for just a few days at a time in New York City where Rob lived and in Idaho where Sara resided. It wasn't until recently that Sara left her residence in Idaho to live with Rob in the East Village in a home that's now nothing but soot and ash. 'We don't need anything. We have each other,' Sara told Dailymail.com. 'That's all we've got,' added Rob. Thursday morning started out bright with yoga and a big delicious brunch. At around 2:30 p.m. the couple went home to 45 East 7th street to relax until Sara got a phone call from a friend saying that there were cupcakes waiting for her at Baked by Melissa. No more: Sara and Rob lived at 45 East 7th street on the corner of the block and the nearby explosion set fire to their building with no longer stands . Decimated: Rubble and soot is all that remains of Sara and Rob's East Village home after the explosion . Sara and Rob left their apartment on a mission to pick up some sweet treats. That decision may have saved their life. As they walked back home down Lafayette street after indulging in a birthday snack, they heard sirens and saw billows of smoke in the air. The explosion occurred at Sushi Park restaurant at 121 Second Avenue at 3:20 p.m. It soon sent the entire block alight and caused neighboring buildings to burn and collapse. Fiery romance: Rob met Sara at the music festival Burning Man and the two struck up a kinship that developed into a deep romance and had just moved in together after dating long distance . Festival and beyond: When Rob met Sara at Burning Man he knew she was special and continued to contact her following the festival and their interactions grew more frequent and meaningful . Love of costumes: Rob and Sara both enjoy making costumes and wearing them together at events . At least 22 people were injured in the incident, including four critically, two of whom were taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Cornell suffering from burns to their airways. The five first responders - among them four firefighters and an EMS worker - also sustained minor injuries. Two people have been reported missing: 23-year-old Nicholas Figueroa, who was on a date at the sushi restaurant, and Moises Lucon, who was a bus boy there, have not been found. It wasn't before long on Thursday that Sara and Rob learned their house was on fire  when they saw photos on Facebook of the windows in their building engulfed in flames. Zany: The couple lost all of their many costumes they've created and Rob even made a special helmet for Sara's birthday that was also lost in the fire . Lost: Many of Sara and Rob's elaborate creations that took hours to make were lost in the fire . Warriors: Rob and Sara love dressing as warriors and other crazy characters for festivals and events . The couple waited for half the day in uncertainty but felt blessed to receive calls from friends and family offering up their homes as a place to stay for the time being. Inside the burning house was a birthday gift Rob made for Sara, a military helmet designed with both a Mohawk and a heart. Sadly, he never got to give it to her. Rob and Sara share a love of making costumes and spend hours designing and sewing their colourful and eccentric frocks that they wear at events and at Burning Man. All of those items were lost inside the home. They have each other: Sara and Rob may have lost their many costumes but they still have their fun spirit . Before the fire: Sara and Rob, pictured on Thursday on a morning birthday outing, never expected they'd lose literally everything they have . Sara, a lawyer, told DailyMail.com that she lost a valuable necklace given to her by her father made of pyrite, a gift to remind her that, 'all that glitters is not gold.' Sara wore the necklace as a good luck charm when she was studying for her bar exam and it pains her to lose something that gave her so much strength at a defining time in her life. Sara told Dailymail.com that it’s not material things that matter most but that the real 'gold' is friends and family. Frog prince?: The couple are sad to have lost so many things but together they are determined to find a solution and find a new home . She described being overwhelmed when going into a store with Rob to get some basic clothing items like socks and underwear for the next few days. ‘I’m not sure I want more stuff,’ Sara said. ‘I looked at the clothes and thought, “is this something I really need?" Rob who was in the budding phases of starting his tequila company Zarandea Tequila and spent a lot of his time working from home lost bottle designs, important work documents, and other valuable essentials for starting his brand. For the time being Sara and Rob are staying with one of Rob’s friends from college but that is merely a temporary solution. Rob never got renter’s insurance because he’s only been living at his home for a few months so he may not get anything back from the building in damages. Rob moved into the apartment in November and while he planned on getting insurance, he hadn't gotten around to it yet. Friends set up a Youcaring.com account to raise a goal of $15,000 to help the pair get back on their feet. So far they’ve raised just over $4,000. Those who wish to donate may do so here. Despite losing their home, Rob and Sara say they feel so blessed that they are not alone. The have love from friends, from family, and last but not least they have the flame that burns for one another.

Diana Castella was teaching part time for Brownsville Middle School's iPrep program when a student told the teacher that her stepfather lays on top of her. Castella said she sought out another teacher's advice because she was unsure of the school's protocol and then reported what the child had told her to a school counselor the next morning. Scroll down for video . Florida teacher Diana Castella claims she was fired just days after reporting that her student, who is under the age of 12, was .

But school administrator told her that she was being investigated because she didn't report the abuse soon enough.

The girl was first questioned by the Department of Childhood Services without Castella in the room, . Castella said she was then let inside in the room, where she claims she heard the student confess that she had been molested by her step-father multiple times. Police were contacted and the student's father was arrested and charged with child molestation and lewd and lascivious conduct. When Castella returned to school, she said she was called into the principal's office and told she was under investigation by the school because she didn't report the incident in a 'timely manner'. A spokesman for Miami-Dade County Schools told NBC 6 that if someone in the district learns about a 'potential abuse case' they are 'required to report it immediately'. But, according to Castella, the principal claimed she had to be let go because the school could no longer afford to fund her particular position - not because of the investigation. The student's father was arrested and charged with child molestation. Castella said the school then told she was under investigation by the school because she didn't report the incident in a 'timely manner' But, according to Castella, the principal claimed she had to be let go because the school could no longer afford to fund her particular position - not because of the investigation . Castella believes she got fired for reporting what her student had told her. Castella said she is 'disgusted with the system', which she says should be fighting to keep on board a teacher who 'did the right thing'. 'I became a teacher for my students,' she said. 'I didn't become a teacher to save the reputation of a school.' The controversy comes just weeks after two teachers in the Miami-Dade County Schools' district were fired for incidents involving students. Last week a music teacher at Miami Palmetto Senior High was arrested and charged of having sex with a 17-year-old student that he admitted to having a nine-month relationship with. And at the beginning of the month a kindergarten teacher at the district's Silver Bluff Elementary School was charged with child abuse after he allegedly dug his nails into a student's hand and leg because she was struggling with math problems.

All article text:Danielle Liddle, 22, was beaten with baseball bats and slashed in the face with a butcher's knife while she was giving birth . A pregnant woman was beaten with baseball bats and slashed in the face with a butcher's knife when a masked gang burst into her home while she was giving birth. Danielle Liddle, 22, was about to leave for hospital when five masked men smashed their way into her house in Basildon, Essex, at around 8.30pm using crowbars. She  suffered a 'serious head injury'  and may have a fractured skull  after the gang attacked her with crowbars and a knife  while her two-year-old child was asleep in bed. Her partner Chris Miller, 33, who was upstairs collecting the hospital bag, came running  to protect her and said the young mother is now too traumatised to go back into the house. The mother-of-two was rushed to Basildon Hospital and gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Tuesday despite her injuries. Her partner, who suffered minor injuries in the attack, said: 'This was an extremely traumatic experience for us both. My girlfriend remains in hospital with a serious head injury when she should be celebrating the birth of our child. 'Please help the police to catch these men whose actions have tainted a period of time which should be a happy one for us.' He told how he had gone upstairs to collect essentials for the hospital after his partner's contractions started coming every six minutes. 'The next thing I heard a loud smash - like a fish tank shattering,' he said. 'Before we knew it we had five men in the house screaming 'give us your money'. They cornered my partner then hit her with a crowbar and bats and cut her across the face screaming and demanding more money. I just threw my arms round her to protect her. They carried on beating us. I was just shouting back at them, 'you are wrong man, she is in labour. 'Me and my girlfriend just started screaming and shouting for help.' The men grabbed the couple's iPad, a Sony Experia mobile phone and £60 in cash  and then ran off. The young mother suffered a fractured skull after the masked gang attacked her in her home  in Beambridge (pictured), Essex . The 22-year-old was rushed to Basildon Hospital (pictured) and gave birth to a healthy baby on Tuesday . Police are now hunting the five men, all ages in their twenties with local accents, who broke into the home in Beambridge, Pitsea, on Monday night. Three of the men wore balaclavas and dark clothes, a fourth gang member was white and the fifth was mixed race. Mr Miller said: 'I can't even describe to you how angry I am. My partner is too traumatised to even go back to our home. She is going to need counselling to help her get through this. To do this to a woman who is in labour - it's sick.' Her sister said: 'They attacked her with crowbars, baseball bats and cut her face with a butchers knife. 'She was screaming for them to stop as she was in labour but this did not stop them. Luckily my two-year-old nephew was asleep upstairs and slept through it. 'My sister has had her face stitched but now discovered she may have a fractured skull.' Detective Inspector Joel Henderson, from Basildon CID, said: 'This was a shocking attack on a young woman who was in labour. It is vital we get those people responsible off the streets of Basildon.'

All article text:Jihadi's John's younger brother was convicted of handling stolen goods in a case just months after the older brother was acquitted of the same charge. Mohammed Emwazi's involvement with criminal gangs has emerged as a key staging post on his path to extremism and eventually to becoming the notorious executioner for the Islamic State. It has now emerged that his younger brother Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. Guilty: Omar Emwazi - younger brother of Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as Jihadi John - pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods in 2012 . The 21-year-old received a community order for 12 months, 100 hours unpaid work and had to pay prosecution costs of £800. Emwazi's younger brother has previously posted his support online for radical preachers including Sheikh Khalid Yasin and Imran ibn Mansur, known as Dawah Man. Omar is also a member of a street preaching group called Power of Dawah, which supports the fundamentalist preacher Abdur Raheem Green, who preached to Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab, the 'Underpants Bomber'. A friend said Omar got into fights at school, and added: 'I don't think he was one of the brightest academically either, to put it politely. 'I know some of the most harmless people that are on dawah stalls. However, given his situation, I can see why that may ring some alarms.' Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempting to blow up a commercial plane on a would-be suicide mission for al-Qaeda. He was caught trying to board a plane on Christmas Day in 2009 with explosives stitched into his underwear, earning him the nickname the 'Underpants Bomber'. Dangerous: Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab (left) - better known as the Underpants Bomber - invited fundamentalist preacher Abdur Raheem Green (right) to speak at the University College London in 2005 . But the Nigerian was left badly burned when the bomb failed to detonate fully on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. He had previously invited controversial Abdur Raheem Green to speak while he was president of Islamic Society at University College London in 2005. Muslim convert Green has previously has been accused of supporting jihadism, and once proclaimed: 'Dying while fighting jihad is one of the surest ways to paradise and Allah's good pleasure' It was also revealed this week that Omar was a member of a group dubbed the 'Muslim mafia' in school and admired a controversial Islamic hate preacher. The 21-year-old is said to have supported Sheikh Khalid Yasin, who was lauded by Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale. Support: Omar Emwazi is said to have used Facebook to profess his admiration for Muslim hate preacher Sheikh Kalid Yasin (left), who inspired Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebowale (right) to convert to Islam . Omar is said to have quickly taken down his Facebook page after his brother's new identity was revealed last week. He reportedly used the site to 'like' Sheikh Yasin, a preacher who has called the Taliban his 'brothers' and denounced both Christian and Jewish beliefs as 'filth'. Yasin has also claimed that the Koran gives men permission to 'beat women lightly' and has called homosexuality an 'aberration' that should be 'punishable by death'. Michael Adebowale - who was jailed last year for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby - said Yasin's views taught him the 'purpose of life' and convinced him to convert to Islam. Mohammed Emwazi  - revealed last week as the evil executioner behind the Jihadi John mask - was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab. Security services were aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014. Evil: Mohammed Emwazi was this week revealed to be ISIS killer 'Jihadi John', seen beheading hostages in videos . It is believed The London Boys had links to the gang behind the failed July 21, 2005 attacks on London. Court documents revealed a leading member of Emwazi's network had a phone conversation on the day of the attacks with Hussein Osman, who was later jailed for life for placing an explosive at Shepherd's Bush tube station. Yesterday, it was revealed that Emwazi's mother screamed out in shock when she realised he was Jihadi John after watching a beheading video. Ghaneya Emwazi, 47, confirmed her son was the IS chief executioner when she and her husband Jasem, 51, were questioned by the Kuwaiti security services on Sunday. Other appalled relatives of Emwazi condemned his actions and said they would welcome his death. A Kuwaiti cousin, who would not give his name, said: ‘We hate him. We hope he will be killed soon. This will be good news for our family.’ It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and twice he was acquitted. The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi who had put it up for sale on Ebay. The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police. Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.' Home: The Emwazi family have left their house in north London, which was visited by authorities investigating Mohammed last week . The items were listed as a BE1 bicycle, a Trek Elpha, a Cannondale Bad Boy Bicycle, a Brompton Bicycle, and a Cervelo Bicycle. Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, gave his address as the family home on the Mozart estate in Queen's Park, West London and his date of birth as August 17 1988. He claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit. The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011. Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted.

All article text:A black female police officer who previously acted as a bodyguard for the Duchess of Cambridge is suing a police force because she claims she was sacked after accusing another officer of racism. Ricky Haruna claims she was sacked for gross misconduct after she claimed a police sergeant at the Metropolitan Police had racially harassed her. Ms Haruna claims that after she made the allegation Sergeant Laurence Boyle convinced an elderly woman with dementia to make false claims of fraud against her. This led to Miss Haruna being hauled before a misconduct panel and dismissed, only to be reinstated after a successful internal appeal. Ricky Haruna joined the Met Police in 2002 and one of her jobs was escorting Kate Middleton before she married . The 39-year-old is now suing the Met Police for race discrimination and wrongful dismissal for the way it handled her case, with her previous claims of racism not forming part of her own misconduct hearing, the Central London Employment Tribunal was told. She claims that although the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) was aware of the race allegations she had made, these were not put before the police misconduct board. Ms Haruna joined the Met Police in 2002 and one of her duties was escorting Kate Middleton before she married Prince William and became the Duchess of Cambridge. During her career she saved two people's lives and received two commendations. Ms Haruna claims she experienced racism from her police colleagues in 2010, and also reported that Sergeant Boyle racially harassed her. Following her allegation an elderly woman came forward and accused Miss Haruna of fraud. This led to what Ms Haruna refers to as her 'malicious arrest' in April 2013. Ms Haruna appeared before a misconduct panel and - despite the Crown Prosecution Service saying the fraud allegation was untenable and they would not be bringing charges in September 2013 - she was disciplined and sacked last June. But in February she was reinstated with full pay after a successful internal appeal against her dismissal. Lawrence Davies, representing Ms Haruna, said in his skeleton argument: 'Prior to her dismissal, the claimant had complained of racism on several occasions. She also claimed that she was being harassed and victimised...The DPS were aware of that allegation. 'However, the DPS failed to put this relevant evidence before the Police Misconduct Board.' He added that Ms Haruna did not raise these claims herself because of 'bad advice' from the Police Federation, the DPS had a 'clear duty' to do so. He said that in light of panel not having any knowledge of the evidence of discrimination, it made the 'wrongful decision' to dismiss her. Mr Davies said: 'We do say PS Boyle is racist and that this sorry saga began when he pressurised a very elderly lady with dementia to make a formal complaint of fraud against the claimant.' He added that PS Boyle's questioning of the woman, who also imagined that Ms Haruna had had an abortion and that Lord Russell had bought her a house, caused her to become 'very upset'. Ms Haruna was reinstated in February this year . It is not argued that the misconduct panel was prejudicial, but that the wrong decision it made was rendered discriminatory by the racist motivation of the DPS and/or PS Boyle. Mr Davies also drew attention to the employment tribunal of black police officer Pc Carol Howard in which the Met admitted it had a written policy to ensure that no discrimination complaint was successful. Ms Howard won £37,000 in her race and sex discrimination claim. However Louise Chudleigh, representing the Metropolitan Police, said once the the CPS had decided to not take any action against Ms Haruna for the fraud allegations, the matter was dealt with as a disciplinary issue, leading to her dismissal. She said Ms Haruna could not have a wrongful dismissal case because she had been reinstated. She further argued that the Pc could not bring race claims because the panel that dismissed her was protected from discrimination claims by judicial immunity proceedings. But Mr Davies said it would be 'absurd' if the officer could not bring her discrimination claim because he said 'even the MPS has accepted that the decision was wrong and given the importance of tackling discrimination in society and in particular the police.' Employment Judge Harjit Grewal reserved her judgment on whether Ms Haruna can bring a case of wrongful dismissal and race discrimination against the Met. Another preliminary hearing has been scheduled for April 30.

All article text:David Duckenfield admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death . The police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster has admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death. But David Duckenfield denied his mindset was focused on hooliganism rather than safety at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989. The retired officer,  70, has already made a series of admissions about 'mistakes' he made, confessed that he lied in the aftermath and apologised 'unreservedly' to fans' families. He said he initially thought the problem was crowd disorder and only realised it was a 'medical emergency at 3.04pm' - 12 minutes after the crush started on the terrace. But at that time transcripts of tape recordings made in the police control box where the match commander was stationed showed a subordinate officer calling for police dogs. Rajiv Menon QC, representing families of the victims, said: 'You must have asked him to do this. It's a medical emergency. Can you explain that? Why on earth do you need dogs at the stadium?' Mr Duckenfield said he had 'no idea' other than he wanted to create a 'secure area' for the rescue operation. Mr Menon asked: 'So dogs requested, ambulances yet to be requested. Correct?' The witness replied: 'It would appear so.' At 3.06pm Mr Duckenfield called for operational support, a request for all available officers in the force area to go to the stadium. Mr Menon asked: 'Why more manpower?', to which Duckenfield replied: 'To help the rescue.' The QC representing the families said responded: 'What rescue? You have yet to call for ambulances or fire crews.' The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers. On the day of the disaster, police became overwhelmed by fans at the turnstiles as kick-off approached and Mr Duckenfield gave the order at 2.52pm to open gates to let them in. Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C, many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them. But Mr Duckenfield, as match commander, had not ordered this to be closed, which was a 'blunder of the first magnitude', the inquest jury heard. The tunnel led directly to the already-full central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace. Some 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace . Around 2,000 fans poured in through Gate C (pictured), many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them, which had not been closed off by police . Ninety-six Liverpool fans died in the ensuing crush minutes later on the terraces of Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest kicked off. Mr Menon said police records did not record Duckenfield declaring a major incident, which would have triggered a disaster rescue plan by emergency services. Mr Duckenfield insisted he had done so and there was an 'omission' in the records. Jurors were also told that an officer at the scene of the disaster made a call at 3.13pm for fire crews equipped with cutting gear to attend the scene. Mr Menon pointed out to Mr Duckenfield that the request for fire service assistance came up to eight minutes after the semi-final was halted. Mr Duckenfield agreed that the eight minutes represented a 'serious amount of time' lost in the effort to save lives but said he was making decisions in a 'very critical' situation. During the closing minutes of his questioning of the retired officer, Mr Menon asked him if he felt it necessary to be present on the pitch. Mr Duckenfield replied: 'Not at all. The incident commander remains in the control room because if I am not in the control room I can't make decisions.' The inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend Hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back-up from dog-handlers . Accusing Mr Duckenfield of showing little, if any, organisation or control while in the control box, Mr Menon asked the witness: 'Your leadership and co-ordination and emergency response was woefully inadequate from start to finish?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'I disagree, sir.' Rejecting claims that he was involved in 'building' South Yorkshire Police's case that drunken fans caused the disaster, the former policeman said: 'After the disaster I was marginalised and I took no part in anything like that at all.' Mr Menon then asserted: 'Your mistake (in failing to foresee where fans would go or close the tunnel) was the most terrifyingly bad mistake that fell woefully below the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent match commander, wasn't it?' Mr Duckenfield responded: 'Sir, I have made my admissions, I take it no further.' Mr Menon continued: 'It was gross negligence and ultimately it caused the disaster and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, didn't it?' Mr Duckenfield answered: 'No, sir. My view is it was an oversight, a mistake.' At an earlier hearing he told the jury he was a Freemason at the time of the accident, but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent. He denied taking part in a 'cover-up' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to Liverpool fans' bad behaviour. The former officer also admitted he was 'possibly in denial' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans, leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the Sheffield stadium. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

All article text:Radamel Falcao has admitted for the first time that he is likely to leave Manchester United at the end of the season. The Colombia star has stayed silent amid speculation that United will reject the opportunity to turn his £5million loan from Monaco into a permanent £43m deal. But Falcao conceded on Tuesday that he will probably have to look elsewhere for regular first-team football, having not started a game under Louis van Gaal for the last month. Radamel Falcao dropped a major hint that he could leave Manchester United when his loan expires . ‘Obviously I need to find a place where I have continuity and can play,’ Falcao said in Bahrain, where Colombia play a friendly on Thursday. ‘I think any footballer needs to play and is happy playing. ‘So when the championship ends surely I’ll sit down, do an analysis and decide what’s best for me.’ Falcao has scored just four goals in 22 appearances for United, where he earns £280,000 a week, and was made to play for the club’s Under 21 team earlier this month. His mentor and former agent, Silvano Espindola, revealed last week that the player has been reduced to tears by his treatment at Old Trafford. Liverpool are being linked with the 29-year-old striker but it is understood that Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia are more likely destinations. The Colombian has been more used to starting from the bench for the Reds this season . ‘Calls come every day so in that sense I’ve got to stay calm, but I keep on the fringe of them, there are people who deal with all that situation,’ said Falcao. ‘I owe myself to Manchester United at the moment, I have faith and hope because lots of things can happen in the number of matches remaining. I will continue to fight to the end at Manchester United.’ While United are happy to let Falcao leave Old Trafford, they will do all they can to ensure that £59.7m record signing Angel di Maria stays. The Argentine is said to be unsettled in England just seven months after arriving from Real Madrid. Falcao came on as a substitute in United's win against Liverpool on Sunday and has scored just six goals . Di Maria’s form has dipped after a bright start and his family have been unhappy since an attempted break-in at their Cheshire home last month. United midfielder Marouane Fellaini, meanwhile, has refuted suggestions that his presence in the team leads to a long-ball game, saying: ‘We play beautiful football.’ Robin van Persie could return against Manchester City on April 12 following a month out with ankle ligament damage. United have no plans to let £59.7million record signing Angel di Maria leave the club in the summer though .

All article text:A random attack by a drunk stranger has completely changed the life of 53-year-old Jose Gonzalez, leaving him in constant pain and with little prospect of ever working again. The paving worker from Homestead, Florida was napping in his work car nearly two years ago, waiting for two co-workers to finish drinking at a bar in Marathon when a drunk patron came outside and set the propane tanks in the back of the truck on fire. Surveillance footage shows the moment then 26-year-old Stuart Collins pulled out a Bic lighter and sparked the flame that then engulfed the truck in flames. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Scroll down for video . Life changed completely: Jose Gonzalez of Homestead, Florida received third-degree burns to 68 per cent of his body in a July 2013 attack by a stranger . Spark: The 53-year-old was sleeping in his work truck, waiting for two coworkers to finish up drinking at a Marathon, Florida bar when a drunk man came out and set propane tanks in the back of the vehicle on fire . Engulfed in flames: The married father-of-one woke up to flames eating away at his clothes, and was on fire for an excruciating 11 minutes . Suspect: Stuart Collins, now 29, was arrested for setting the car on fire. He is being held on $1.05 million bond for charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief . Gonzalez says he woke up to his clothes on fire, but was lucky enough to escape the truck by himself before help arrived. However, the flames had spread too fast and he suffered covered in fire for 11 minutes - leaving him with third-degree burns on 68 per cent of his body. Gonzalez spent the following six months after the July 12, 2013 attack in the hospital, going in and out of a coma while he underwent some 15 surgeries. 'It changed everything. I am a useless man on a bed,' Gonzalez said in Spanish to CBS Miami. 'Why did he do this? We don't know each other. He did this for no reason,' Gonzalez said of Collins. 'It seems like he just became enraged and lit the truck on fire and unfortunately I was inside sleeping and he set me on fire. It changed my life forever.' Now he's speaking out as he plans to file a lawsuit against the owners of J.J.'s Doghouse, the bar that continued to serve Collins. 'If there would have been security, this could have been avoided and I wouldn't be burnt,' Gonzalez told Local 10. The Gonzalez family's lawyer Jason Brenner cited surveillance footage which shows Collins entering the bar that night, claiming the video proves the young man was clearly intoxicated. Lawsuit: The Gonzalez family plans to sue the bar that continued to serve Collins. Collins seen above in a white shirt, stumbling around, in surveillance footage from just before the explosion . Fault: Gonzalez says if J.J.'s Doghouse had security protocols in place, they might have prevented Collins from causing harm . Charred: Above, a photo released by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office shows the charred remains of Gonzalez's work truck . 'This was a very small bar in terms of space, and where this incident took place, it was but three feet from the back door, and this was an area where people always hung out,' Brenner told WSVN. 'When you see in the video, when this man got out of the cab, he was extremely intoxicated and identified by the bartender. He had erratic and aggressive behavior throughout the evening.' Collins told police he only had two rum and Cokes and three beers in a six-hour span that night. The now 29-year-old was arrested after the incident and is being held on $1.05 million bond at the Monroe County Jail on charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief. He has plead not guilty to the charges ahead of his trial, which is expected to start in June. Painful: Following the attack, Gonzalez spend six months in the hospital and underwent 15 surgeries . Never the same: His mobility is now limited and it's unlikely that he will ever work again. That causes a serious hardship on his family since his wife also lost her job as a vice principal . Forever dependent: Gonzalez is now relies on his wife and teenage son to take care of him . Happier times: Above, Gonzalez pictured before the attacks. Alone on the left, and with his wife of 21 years on the right . Meanwhile, Gonzalez is in his own form of prison due to to the injuries which have left him completely dependent on his wife and teenage son, and will likely never work again. That has put a serious strain on the family, since his wife also lost her job as a vice principal. 'It's gone from me being able to do pretty much whatever I want with my dad to not being able to do very much at all,' his son Jose Gonzalez Jr said. 'In fact, I have to do most things for him along with my mother.' In addition to the planned lawsuit against J.J.'s Doghouse, the Gonzalez family settled another lawsuit against the property's owner but the terms were kept confidential.
