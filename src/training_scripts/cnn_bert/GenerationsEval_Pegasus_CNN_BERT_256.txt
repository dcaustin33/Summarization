All article text:(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the Congress this week was as eagerly anticipated in Tehran as it was in Washington. The Iranian reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference. While some of Netanyahu's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the Iranian state, the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to Netanyahu's baseless charge that Iran's vendetta against the Jewish people is an ancient mission. The earliest official reactions were predictably the most vigorous in denouncing Netanyahu's message to the American people. Ali Larijani, the powerful speaker of the Iranian parliament, painted Netanyahu as the leader of a "tin pot regime" that is not as concerned about Iran's nuclear program as it is of Tehran's growing regional influence. The hardline Kayhan newspaper, the key official outlet linked to the office of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the speech "trash talking" but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction. The paper, skeptical of President Hassan Rouhani's nuclear negotiations with the Americans from the beginning, said Netanyahu's comments present an awkward truth for the pro-negotiation faction in Tehran: the Israeli leader and his American supporters are openly signaling the dispute with Iran can only be resolved once there is a change of regime there. Iranian media coverage of Netanyahu's speech mentioned the controversy in the U.S. around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it. As one hardline newspaper, Khorasan, put it, "although it is undeniable that Obama and Netanyahu disagree on Iran, the [recent] remarks of the two [leaders] shows that they both seek the same goal." The idea that the U.S. and Israel share the same strategic goal to rein in Iran but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners' stance in Tehran. The moderate outlets, supportive of President Rouhani, have put a different spin on Netanyahu's speech. Unlike the hardliners, they are not painting the Obama-Netanyahu fallout as some orchestrated good cop-bad cop ploy to maximize concessions from Tehran. Instead, they emphasize that there is a genuine difference in opinion between the U.S. and Israel. The moderate faction sees the controversy around Netanyahu's speech to the Congress and his failure to squeeze the Obama White House to toughen its negotiation terms with Tehran as an indication that Netanyahu is the one who is isolated. The hardliners and the moderates were in full agreement on one point, and that was the delight they shared about the absence of some 60 out of 232 Democratic members of the Congress from Netanyahu's speech. It is too early to gain a good insight into the reaction of ordinary Iranians to Netanyahu's speech. But one aspect of his speech is bound to create backlash among ordinary Iranians outside the corridors of the state: his invocation of festival of Purim, which commemorates the salvation of Jewish people in ancient Persia. The historic event is recorded in the Book of Esther but Netanyahu's characterization implied that the Persian people's history of anti-Semitism and the pursuit of agenda to destroy the Jewish people is an ancient mission. "Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us," Netanyahu said. With that line, he put the ruling Islamists in Tehran on par with ruling Persian empires that have come before them. As is already evident in the Persian-language social media, this will not go down well with ordinary Iranians, many of whom are not supporters of the Islamist system in Tehran and will resent the charge of eternal Persian anti-Semitism. They wish Netanyahu had made more effort to distinguish between the Islamist rulers in Tehran -- many of whom undoubtedly harbor anti-Semitic views -- and the people of Iran whose history with the Jewish nation is far more amicable than Netanyahu's portrayal of history suggests. What is more instantly measurable is the impact of Netanyahu's speech among officials in Tehran. The Iranian response to Netanyahu's speech to the Congress is best described as one that reflects the clash of visions between moderates and hardliners in the echelons of power. For the moderates, the controversy around his speech and the cold-shoulder Netanyahu got from the White House is itself a vindication of President Rouhani's gamble on reaching a diplomatic solution to Iran's 12-year nuclear saga. The hardliners have been quick to paint Netanyahu's visit to Washington as an example of the insincerity of the Americans in dealing with Iran, but not even the hawks in Tehran are claiming that Netanyahu's presence in the U.S. Congress is grounds to shift Iran's nuclear diplomatic strategy.

All article text:A daredevil Swiss wingsuit flyer has jumped off the side of a mountain in pitch darkness and flown down past huge pillars of rock using only the light from two bright red flares. And the amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier. In the picture Kerber's route appears as a glowing red line running down from the top of the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain in the resort town of Engelberg in central Switzerland to the bottom. Scroll down for video . The amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier . Kerber used two superheated emergency flares on the descent down the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain . The daredevil pictured at the moment he leaped into the darkness from the summit of Titlis . And just to show how dangerous jumping with the wingsuit was, Kerber made the flight during the day, showing how a wrong turn would easily have sent him crashing into one of the rocky crags that he was flying close to as he hurtled down from the mountain top. He said: 'I wanted to do a wingsuit BASE flight at night during winter for a very long time. But somehow I never really managed to do it.' The idea became reality when they decided to try and do a single photograph on a slow shutter speed and at the same time fit a light to the jumper so that the flight down the mountain could be recorded. The first problem was that it was difficult to find a light that was bright enough to be seen from a distance of one mile away, where the camera needed to be placed. They solved it, though, by using two superheated emergency flares. These also provided some light to help illuminate the way, although the intense heat also posed a risk that they might set the suit on fire. Patrick said: 'We used flares exactly like the ones used for rescue missions or emergencies. But flares burn very, very hot and my biggest fear was burning holes or melting the suit. That would have been super dangerous. To show how dangerous the jump was, Kerber did a trial run in daylight . A slight mistake would have sent Kerber crashing into craggy rocks . The wingsuit jump produced a dramatic video, with Kerber zooming down the mountain at breakneck speed . 'There definitely was a lot of pressure. Even though we did intense testing before, I did not know for sure how it would turn out. Having fire really close to you on a wingsuit BASE flight leaves no margin for error. Everything has to be worked out.' The two photographers, Fabian Wyss and Meier, stood on the other side of the valley on the Furrenalp to take the snap. Patrick also had to wait until the torches burned out before he could open the parachute. He said: 'I definitely did not want to open up my parachute with fire still around me, as this could be very dangerous. I only have one single parachute attached to me. If this one burns or melts, it's over!' Kerber decided to use two torches. The first one he ignited before he took off and held in his right hand so it would be visible to the photographer. When the torch burned out, he opened up his parachute and when it was safely in the air, ignited a second torch attached to his foot. He said: 'I only had 20 seconds to ignite the second one as it also burned for one minute and I only had 1 minute and 15 seconds to the landing area.' Patrick Kerber has jumped at night before, but not in winter and only at full moon. He said: 'The feeling was very intense and amazing. It is much harder to orientate yourself, as you can't see as well. It feels much more intense because you fly with more feeling and awareness of your body and movements.'

All article text:(CNN)FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told Iran to end its "intolerable" ban on women attending football matches. Writing in the FIFA Weekly magazine published by world football's governing body, Blatter described the situation as one that "cannot continue." Iran's ban was put in the spotlight at the Asian Cup in Australia earlier this year, when thousands of female Iranian fans watched their team without restriction. At the match against Iraq, activists unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman jailed for trying to watch a volleyball match against Brazil in 2014, and called for the ban to end. The measure was imposed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-Islamic. Iran is in the running to host the 2019 edition of the Asian tournament, for which the United Arab Emirates is also bidding. But the ban is widely expected to scupper its chances of securing the event. Blatter wrote: "I raised the topic at my meeting with the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, and came away with the impression that this intolerable situation could change over the medium term. "However, nothing has happened. A collective stadium ban still applies to women in Iran, despite the existence of a thriving women's football organization. "This cannot continue. Hence my appeal to the Iranian authorities -- open the nation's football stadiums to women." During last year's football World Cup, CNN reported how fans in Iran gathered to watch games in venues that defied a ban on public screenings. At one coffee shop in the capital, Tehran, the tense game against Argentina -- a game Iran lost only to an injury-time Lionel Messi goal -- was watched by a large mixed crowd. "100 percent it's better this way," said Negar Valayi. "It doesn't happen often. It would be great if we have more of this." "It's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited," said Roya Marzbahan. Hoardings advertising the World Cup throughout Tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women. And state TV broadcasts of matches employed a delay of several seconds in order for images of female fans deemed too racy to be censored. Blatter also hit out at football's continental confederations for failing to elect any women onto governing body's executive committee. The committee includes three women -- one of whom has voting rights and two of whom are co-opted -- but they are elected directly by the FIFA congress following a change to the statutes in 2011. "This was hard work because the members of FIFA's executive committee are elected by the national associations... and there was never, never a proposal for a woman to be finally in FIFA," the 78-year-old said at an event in Switzerland. "We had to take the decision, and I did it in 2011 at the end of the congress, [that] we must have at least one woman on the executive committee." He described football as a "macho" sport and warned: "We should change in the future."

The photographs were taken by three men who climbed to the peak of the land mass 40 miles (65 km) northwest of the capital, Nuku'alofa. The island started forming in January after a volcano exploded underwater and then expanded creating a mile long, cone-shaped formation. Scroll down for video . Stunning images have emerged of a new island that has formed off the coast of Tonga - although scientists say it could soon disappear . Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai sits beneath the ocean 39 miles (62km) northwest of Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa. The volcano gets its name from the two islands it is situated between - Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai. It is said to be part of the volcanic Pacific Ring of Fire and is believed to one of a 36 undersea volcanoes in that region. A short-lived eruption in March 2009, lasted for almost a week. At the time, geologists said the eruption originated from two volcanic vents - one was located on Hunga Ha'apai, while the other was around 330ft (100m) offshore. The two vents spewed so much debris, however, they created a new land mass. Source: Atlas Obscura . Hotel owner GP Orbassano, along with a friend and his son, arrived at one of the island's three black beaches on Saturday. 'It was a perfect day, with fantastic views – bright blue sky and the sea was the same colour as the sky,' GP Orbassano, one of the locals, told Tonga's Matangi Online. The island is made mainly of scoria, which is a dark coloured volcanic rock that can sometimes contain crystals. The holes in the material form when gases that were dissolved in the magma come out of solution as it erupts . Scientists believe the dimensions of the new island are about 1.1 miles (1.8 km) by 0.9 miles (1.5km), and that it rises about 328ft (100 metres) above the sea. Orbassano admitted that the climb was dangerous as a result of the excessive heat on the dark landscape, according to Matangi Online. However, he said the natural beauty of the location could make it into a popular tourist attraction before the island disappears in a few months. The island was first spotted in an image taken by the Pleiades satellite on 19 January 2015. The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai underwater volcano, that created the formation, is located between two land masses in the Tonga archipelago - Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai. They said the surface of the island was still warm and, after climbing to the highest point of its crater, they caught sight of a vast green lake which smelled of sulphur. 'The island is double the size of Fafa. There is a lot of rock, it's not just ash. It looks like the moon,' said Orbassano. The region is dubbed Ring of Fire because of the high levels of seismic activity in the area. Hunga Tonga's latest eruption began on 19 December 2014 and continued into this month. Steam, ash and nitrogen and phosphorus erupted from the ocean, and international flights around the island were cancelled. At its peak, the ash plume reached heights of more than 14,765ft (4,500 metres). The photographs were taken by three men who climbed to the peak of the land mass 40 miles (65 km) northwest of the capital, Nuku'alofa . The adventurers said the surface of the island was still warm and, after climbing to the highest point of its crater, they caught sight of a vast green lake which smelt of sulphur . The island is made mainly of scoria, which is a dark coloured volcanic rock that can sometimes contain crystals.

The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai underwater volcano, that created the formation, is located between two land masses in the Tonga archipelago - Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai. In addition to creating the new island, the eruption is also said to have stripped its two neighbouring islands of vegetation, and caused what is known as a red tide. A red tide, or algal bloom, occurs when there is a sudden increase in the amount of algae in water. When levels of nitrogen and phosphorus rise, which can be caused by underwater eruptions such as the one off the coast of Tonga, algae can multiply. Typically, this causes water to turn green, but the effect also causes reds and yellows to be released. In particular, a bloom of dinoflagellate algae causes water to turn blood red in colour. Land masses forming after volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are relatively common. In 2013, a volcanic island appeared off the coast of Japan, near the uninhabited island of Nishino Shima. Dubbed Niijima, it was first spotted on 20 November in the Ogasawara chain around 600 miles south of Tokyo and had tripled in size by the following month. Scientists believe the dimensions of the new island are about 1.1 miles (1.8 km) by 0.9 miles (1.5km), and that it rises about 328ft (100 metres) above the sea . Orbassano admitted that the climb was dangerous as a result of the excessive heat on the dark landscape, according to Matangi Online . The island started forming in January after a volcano exploded underwater and then expanded creating a cone-shaped formation . Initially, scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time. However, the island expanded to 56,000 square metres (13.8 acres) - around three times its size - as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below. Similarly, in September that year, a new island appeared off the coast of Pakistan. It was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft (20 metres) high and 295ft (89 metres) wide on the coastline near the port of Gwadar. The natural beauty of the location could make it into a popular tourist attraction before the island disappears in a few months . Gianpiero Orbassano and Branko Sugar of Nuku'alofa are pictured top of the crater rim of the newly formed island, at Hunga, Tonga .

All article text:Roman Zozulya's first-half strike edged Dnipro to a crucial win against Dutch champions Ajax at the Kiev Olympic Stadium. Having squandered a series of early chances the hosts took the lead on the half hour mark when Zozulya collected Yevhen Konoplyanka’s cut back to send a left-footed strike across Jasper Cillessen and into the net. Dnipro, playing in their first ever last 16 tie in the Europa League, kept Frank De Boer’s side relatively quiet and head to Amsterdam next week in a promising position. Dnipro players celebrate Roman Zozulya's opening strike, which proved to be the winner in Ukraine . DNIPRO (4-4-2): Boyko; Fedetskiy, Douglas, Cheberyachko, Egidio; Fedorchuk, Rotan, Zozulya, Bezus (Gama 57); Konoplyanka (Shakhov 81), Seleznyov (Kalinic 75) Subs not used: Lastuvka, Luchkevych, Svatok, Blyznychenko . Scorer: Zozulya 30 . Booked: Fedetskiy, Rotan, Zozulya, Shakhov . AJAX (4-3-3): Cillessen; van Rhijn, Veltman, Viergever, Boilesen; Bazoer, Klaassen, Serero (Sinkgraven 59); El Ghazi, Milik (Zivkovic 76), Schone (Kishna 60) Subs not used: Moisander, van der Hoorn, Andersen, Boer . Booked: Boilesen, Bazoer . Referee: Ivan Bebek . Ajax were hoping to maintain a seven game unbeaten run in all competitions but struggled to break down the dogged hosts. The first chance went the way of the visitors after just four minutes as midfielder Thulani Serero attempted to chip keeper Denys Boyko but that was a rare moment of progress for Ajax. However in first-half stoppage time Joel Veltman spurned a glorious chance to level the contest when standing all alone at the back post, but the centre-back blasted a volley way over the bar from a few yards out. De Boer’s side improved after the break but failed to register a single shot on target and will have to improve drastically for the second leg in Amsterdam next Thursday. It wasn't all good news for the hosts as Artem Fedetskiy, Ruslan Rotan and Roman Zozulya all picked up booking to rule themselves out of the second leg in Holland.

All article text:Saturday Night Live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining ISIS, and not the US Army, at the end. The segment was laid out the same as the recent My Bold Dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his Toyota Camry. The spot that first aired during the 2015 Super Bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service. In this version however, the father, played by Taran Killam, dropped off his daughter, played by Dakota Johnson, and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him; 'Dad, it's just ISIS.' Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson (above) played a young girl joining ISIS in a skit on Saturday Night Live . The skit ended with the tagline; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad' There was even a vehicle with the ISIS flag in the skit . This is the first time that Johnson, the star of Fifty Shades of Grey, has hosted Saturday Night Live . From there, Johnson jumped on a truck with actors playing members of the Islamic State and with a mock flag, which actually appears to read; 'I would like a cat.' When the father then says to take care of his girl, one of the men yells; 'Death to America.' Then, as the commercial ended, a message appeared on screen; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad.' Johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody . Some on twitter found the parody 'depraved' Others on twitter found the bit 'hysterical' Johnson teels her father not to worry saying, 'Dad, it's just ISIS' This all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the United States with ties to the terrorist organization and three female British teenagers left to join the group. The skit was met with outrage by many on Twitter, who took the program to task for being insensitive. 'Can't be serious. Isis skit? Like going to college? When so many people are being kidnapped and killed?Depraved,' wrote Raine LaChance. 'Apparently NBC and SNL thought it was funny to have a skit showing ISIS driving to an airport to pick up an American girl. Tasteless Scum!,' said Jim Ematrudo. Others however found the skit 'hilarious.' This also comes the same week that the identity of ISIS member Jihadi John was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in Iraq dating back thousands of years in Mosul. John is British citizen Mohammed Emwazi, the man who is responsible for the high-profile beheadings of Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Steven Sotliff as well as British citizens David Haines and Alan Henning in the name of the terrorist organization. His identity was previously unknown as he always wears a mask. Canada this week also said that they believe four missing teenagers may have traveled to be in ISIS.

All article text:Baked: Jennifer Becker, 49, from Maine, has been charged with furnishing marijuana-laced brownies and endangering the welfare of a child . A Maine woman has been arrested for allegedly giving her 13-year-old daughter brownies laced with marijuana. Jennifer Becker, 49, from Edgecomb, was arrested Monday and charged with furnishing marijuana and endangering the welfare of a child. The woman was taken into custody after the Maine Department of Health and Human Services received a complaint claiming that Becker gave her underage daughter baked goods containing cannabis. The divorced mother of one was taken to the Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset and later released on bail. A judge has ordered Becker to avoid contact with her 13-year-old daughter, who is now staying with her father in Florida. The mother is due back in court in April, reported Portland Herald Press. On her Facebook page, Becker listed her occupation as a hemp farmer; hemp is a commonly used term for high-growing varieties of the Cannabis plant and its related products. She is also a member of the New England HempCrete - a company that offers environmentally friendly building materials made out of hemp. Blame game: Becker said her daughter, who 'has issues' told her therapist about the pot-laced brownies, which eventually resulted in her arrest . In an interview with the local station WGME, Becker said her teenage daughter ‘has issues’ and that everything is ‘being blown out of proportion.’ ‘She confided to her therapist that she took some [pot brownies] and now here we are,’ the 49-year-old suspect stated. Maine legalized medical marijuana in 1999, and a decade later the state decriminalized cannabis when Governor John Baldacci signed a bill which made possession of 2.5 ounces or less a civil infraction. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws legalizing marijuana in some form. Green thumb: According to her Facebook page, the 49-year-old divorcee is a hemp farmer in Maine .

All article text:It was once an eagerly anticipated new block of flats, built to help with the housing crisis in Hull and standing as the city's tallest building. But in a mere eight seconds Highcourt, a 20-storey tower block measuring more than 190ft high in the Orchard Park estate of Hull, was flattened to leave just a pile of rubble behind. People lined the streets to watch the demolition, which took place almost 50 years after the high rise was first built. Scroll down for video . Highcourt, Hull's tallest building (left) containing flats, was demolished and turned into a pile of rubble (right) in just eight seconds . The tower was demolished using explosives on Sunday afternoon. It was knocked down as part of a 'masterplan' for the state which will see a new shopping centre, a care home and affordable housing built. But for some people who had seen the vast tower block planned and built, the scale and speed of its destruction was a sad event. Samantha Clark, 58, said: 'I was a young girl living in north Hull when this block of flats was built. Highcourt was built in 1969 to help with the housing crisis and extended over 19 floors but yesterday explosives were used to demolish it . The building began to topple to the right hand side as the explosives tore through the bottom section and dust and rubble collected . As the tower began to fall huge plumes of smoke and clouds of dust were seen coming from the building as it clattered towards the ground . In seconds the 190ft high building fell towards the ground to make way for a planned new estate that will see new houses built . Eight seconds after the explosion the tower block was no more, and replaced by smoke and piles or rubble as workmen looked on . 'I remember the new building being celebrated because there was a houses shortage at the time but now its demolition is being celebrated. It is quite emotional really.' The tower was built in 1969 and stood as one of the tallest parts of the city, along with Hull Royal Infirmary. Jim Roles, 61, said: 'I can't believe that a block of flats that size, which took an age to build, could be demolished as quickly as that. The 19 storey building was flattened to the ground on Sunday afternoon and workers will now have to begin clearing the large site . All that is left of Highcourt high rise is now large slabs of concrete and twisted metal after it was demolished within a matter of seconds . The tower block, shown previously, was built in the 1960s and was the tallest building in the city of Hull, as well as the infirmary . 'One minute it was there, the next it was gone and that is that. It was an eyesore but I will miss it when I walk past every morning.' More than 400 affordable homes are currently being built on the estate - many of which are being made more energy efficient. Councillor John Black, of Hull City Council, said: 'It is an exciting time for residents of Orchard Park. 'Highcourt was one of the tallest buildings in the city along with Hull Royal Infirmary so it is a big deal that it is coming down but our masterplan for Orchard Park will improve the estate hugely.'

All article text:(WIRED)Screens are rectangles. Even the 3-year-old playing with your iPad could tell you that. But what would the digital world look like through a different sort of frame? Say... a circular one? Monohm, a startup based in Berkeley, California, was founded around this very idea. For the last year, the three-person team has been working a circular, palm-sized device dubbed Runcible. They cheekily refer to it as the "anti-smartphone," a description that goes for both its form factor and its value system. The round device is meant to be the antidote to our feed-obsessed, notification-saturated digital existence. It's a challenge to the rectangular status quo and everything it represents. That's a quixotic dream, but an interesting one. Display technologies have a long and rectangular history. Before smartphones there were movie screens, TVs, and computers, not to mention paintings and pages of print. And then of course there are windows—in some ways the original glass rectangles. In each case, the rectangle's prominence can be attributed in large part to practicality. Whether you're talking about film or glass or stone, rectangles are easy to make. They don't leave much wasted material. As frames for shaping the world, however, different types of rectangles can produce vastly different effects. 14 of the Best Architecture Photos From the Past Year . In her book The Virtual Window, which traces the rectangular frame from Renaissance painting up through Microsoft Windows, media theorist Anne Friedberg offers an example from the history of architecture, centering on a public feud between French builder August Perret and the preeminent modernist architect Le Corbusier. Perret was a strong advocate of the traditional French casement window, which was oriented vertically. Its main function, he said, was to let light into a room. Le Corbusier, making use of new manufacturing techniques, designed his buildings around long, horizontal windows, which were as much about framing the outside world as illuminating the space within. The disagreement influenced architecture for decades to come. The simple act of turning a rectangle on its side gave us entirely new ways to think about space. Rectangles are still subtly dictating our behavior today. Movie screens, chased by TVs, have gotten bigger and wider, encouraging us to sit back and lose ourselves in the spectacle. (In 1930, Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein lamented how the cinema's "passive horizontalism." He wanted the screen to be square.) Smartphones, with their slender, touch-controlled displays, have become a distinctly more active rectangle. Paired with the never-ending vertical feeds that fill apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, they've become an irresistible, inexhaustible diversion. The point is this: Frames matter. They suggest certain things about how we should approach them. They shape the type of stuff that's made for them. And if just turning a rectangle on its side can make such a big difference, imagine all the interesting things that might happen if you left the rectangle behind altogether. Runcible isn't meant to be a smartphone replacement so much as an alternative. "I think we've become really, really good at getting interrupted and creating conduits for interruption," says Monohm CEO Aubrey Anderson, who met his co-founders during a stint at Apple. "It's time now to use technology to get a little quieter." If miniaturizing the computer is what got us the smartphone, Runcible asks what a gizmo might look like if you started by souping up a pocket watch. And the shape of the device is central to that thinking. A circular frame, after all, is no good for browsing a Twitter feed. 12 Most Ancient and Magnificent Trees From Around the World . So what is it good for? That's the question. At this point, Runcible as much a provocation as an actual product. The three-person team, which has been working with the San Francisco design studio Box Clever on the concept for nearly a year, has some prototype hardware and a crude sketch of an operating system, but they've still got a long way to go. They've got a few vague ideas for applications. One is a sort of dashboard that gives you an overview of activity on your social media accounts. Another is a compass-style mapping system that encourages wandering instead of pure A-to-B efficiency. But they're more enthusiastic about the philosophy behind it all: They want to see applications that distill information and streamline interaction, software that constrains the smartphone experience as it exists today. All this is easier said than done, of course. Throwing out centuries of rectangular thinking and starting from scratch ain't easy. Plus, it's not clear that people really want constraint to begin with. Smartphones are distracting, sure, but they're also incredibly useful and immensely entertaining and maybe a little distraction is a fair price to pay for all the good stuff. Still, even as a hint of a possible device, Runcible is compelling. For one thing, the company's hardware model feels great in the hand (The team's hardware guy, George Arriola, came from Sony, where he helped design the PlayStation 4.) The model's curved back brings to mind the very first iPhone—and makes you consider how each successive generation has become a little bit harder to hold. And though unformed, the vision for the software is interesting too. If today's interactive rectangles and infinite feeds signal that there's always more stuff just outside the frame, circles could offer something more self-contained, more complete. Maybe even something actively inefficient. Rectangles are beautiful and functional. Circles are zen. A circular device would sever the link to the printed page, the TV and the computer, and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration. Pocket watches and compasses. Microscopes and telescopes. Peep holes, port holes, and wormholes. Dials, buttons, and other circular controls. 15 Incredible Photos That'll Remind You to Be Awed by Planet Earth . If nothing else, the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that underlie our existing devices. Maybe thinking about circles could help us make our rectangles better. Runcible is just one scrappy, literal attempt to abandon the rectangle. But similar thinking is happening elsewhere. Android Wear, Google's smartwatch operating system, reconsiders what apps should look like on a tiny circular display. Apple Watch is in some ways another rectangle, but its real estate is limited enough that it will also encourage new, less rectangular thinking. (Note how its home screen ditches iPhone's grid of icons for a blob of circular ones. Also note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds). We've seen how sensors can be harnessed to choreograph experiences that happen outside of the frame entirely, as with Disney's Magic Bands, which usher you through the company's parks. And then of course there are technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality, where your nose is effectively pressed so close to the glass that the frame disappears entirely. Here, the screen is less of a window, more of a lens. The only frame is your field of vision. Rectangles will endure. They're easy, they're efficient. But as new components and manufacturing techniques make it easier to experiment with other forms, we'll likely find people exploring the unique effects they can produce. Just recently, in fact, we saw an instance of a tech industry giant leaving the glass rectangle behind in a very big way. In a 10 minute video, Google proposed a new headquarters that would leaves boxy buildings behind in favor of tent-like structures draped in glass. These buildings don't have vertical windows or horizontal windows. They're nothing but windows, or maybe they're so radical that the concept of "window" doesn't even really apply. Whatever the case, there's nothing rectangular about them, and Google's convinced they're the future. Read more from WIRED: .

All article text:Any mother who is charged with getting a young family ready in the morning knows exactly how physically demanding it can be. And it is a daily reality Lili Kirtin-Grossman - who is only eight - knows all too well. Before Lili, from Barnet, north London, even heads out to school in the morning she has to help to get three people dressed, as well as put on the wash and make breakfast for her family. Scroll down for video . 'Capable' Lili Kirtin-Grossman, 8, helps to support her mum Sarah, who suffers from a degenerative spine condition and has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, with looking after her two younger siblings . The young schoolgirl knows how to work the family washing machine and will frequently put on a load of washing before going to school in a morning . Lili has been identified as one of Britain's youngest carers, looking after her younger siblings Kaya and Tyler as well as her mother, Sarah. The 37-year-old, who is an ex-dancer, is registered disabled and suffers from a degenerative condition - scoliosis - which causes the spine to curve. The painful illness not only makes it difficult for her to walk but can leave her in agony. In addition, Sarah has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder, which has seen her sectioned twice. Sarah is separated from Lili's father Graeme and has two other younger children, three-year-old Tyler, who suffers from ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and two-year-old Kaya, who, more often than not, Lili is charged with taking care of. She told the Mirror: 'I've always done lots to help Mummy. She wakes me up in the morning around 7am - I'm normally a bit tired, but I get myself dressed and then help Kaya out of her cot, because we share a room.' Mum Sarah (left) says she feels guilty that she has to ask Lili to help with family life. Lili (right) can prepare family meals including pie and mash and spaghetti bolognese and knows how to use a knife safely . An average day continues with Kaya preparing 'Coco Pops and milk' for her little sister and making her mother a cup of tea. Lili adds: 'Some mornings I'll run Mummy a bath. Depending on how well she is, she can dress herself, but I help with things she finds hard, like putting on her socks and shoes. Then, when we've all got our bags and coats on, I go to school.' Lili's story is all too familiar. According to the charity Carers Trust, there are currently estimated to be at least 180,000 carers under 18 in the UK. The organisation has launched a new website, Babble.carers.org, specifically for children who are caring for siblings or grown ups. The charity adds that many children feel they can't share the burden of what's happening at home, with up to 39 per cent of young carers not admitting to a teacher that they are looking after someone. Another harrowing statistic is that children caring for others often face bullying, with 68 per cent of young carers saying they have faced name-calling at school. Lili is a dab hand in the kitchen but says she doesn't feel like she's missing out: 'The only time I feel a bit jealous of other kids is when I go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps' For Lili, school offers some respite from the relentless routine at home. When the school bell rings in the afternoon, Lili can often find herself head of the kitchen, preparing family staples such as spaghetti bolognese and pie and mash. Although Sarah arranges for food shopping to be delivered, little Lili is no stranger to running errands and is a familiar face at the local shops. 'I'm used to shop assistants and customers looking surprised and asking me if I'm by myself,' smiles Lili. 'I just explain my Mummy is outside waiting, and I make sure I get the right change.' Other household chores include hoovering, separating our colours from whites and putting on a wash-load and doing the dishes...tasks which leave mum Sarah feeling wracked with guilt. 'I feel constantly guilty that Lili does so much for me and the other kids,' says Sarah. 'I should be looking after her.' Sarah says the situation was made worse when she split with her partner Graeme in 2014, quickly plunging Lili into the role as key carer. Sarah (left) separated from her partner Graeme last year, leaving Lili (centre) a key ally in caring for her younger children Kaya (far left), now 2 and Tyler, (far right) now 3 . Time for fun: Mum Sarah makes sure Lili (above right) is well supported. The eight-year-old is part of a local group for young carers and has access to a counsellor if she needs it . 'She's always been so grown up and capable. Graeme and I decided to split up last year – it's not easy living with someone who's bipolar. He's a good father and the children see him all the time. 'I do worry Lili will end up resenting me one day. I ask her if she wishes she was like her friends, but she just says, "This is my home, you're my mum, why would I want anything else?" I'm lucky to have her.' In a bid to inject some fun into Lili's life, Sarah ensures that her daughter is as well supported as she can be. She has support from counsellors and is a member of a young carer's club which focuses on enabling Lili and other children in similar situations to kick back and have fun. So, does Lili worry that she's missing out? The resilient youngster seems to take her demanding role in her stride, saying only that she enjoys spending time with her friends and with her dad. She adds that all she'd really like is to 'make mummy better'. 'The only time I feel a bit jealous of other kids is when I go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps and biscuits while they watch TV. I wish I could have more play dates, but it's hard for Mummy to have extra children round.' 'I do like helping Mummy, but I can get fed up sometimes when she keeps sending me up the stairs to fetch nappies or put clothes away. I'll say, "I don't want to", and sometimes she'll say, "It's OK, I'll leave it here and you can do it later."' 'I never wish I was anyone else. But if there is one thing in the world I could wish for, it would be to make Mummy better.' For more information on young carers and the support they can receive, visit carers.org .

All article text:A new statue of Mahatma Gandhi in London’s Parliament Square was described as ‘a magnificent tribute’ by David Cameron after he unveiled it yesterday. The 9ft bronze figure marks 100 years since Gandhi began his peaceful struggle for India’s independence from the British. At the ceremony, a band played Indian classical music on sitars, the country’s flags festooned the square and schoolchildren stood in the crowd to watch. Prime Minister David Cameron meets with Gandhi's grandson Gopalkrishna, right, at Westminster . The statue of the Indian leader was unveiled in Westminster today by the nation's finance minister . Mr Cameron described Gandhi as 'one of the most towering figures in the history of world politics' Mr Cameron said: ‘This statue is a magnificent tribute to one of the most towering figures in the history of world politics – and by putting Mahatma Gandhi in this famous square, we are giving him an eternal home in our country. ‘Many of his teachings remain as potent today as when he first made them. ‘This statue celebrates the incredibly special friendship between the world’s oldest democracy and its largest, as well as the universal power of Gandhi’s message.’ The privately funded work, created by Philip Jackson, shows Gandhi dressed in a shawl and traditional dhoti skirt, with his hands clasped. Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, who helped unveil the statue, said: ‘How many countries celebrate the life work of a man who opposed it with vehemence for more than three decades? Not many.’ Gandhi stands opposite a statue of Sir Winston Churchill, who described him as a 'half-naked …seditious fakir'. The statue by Philip Jackson is located on Parliament Square, directly across from Winston Churchill .

All article text:Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of international fixtures and reflects on a selection of interesting rumours from the Football League. 1. Ashley Williams was on Arsenal’s radar for ages before signing a new four-year deal at Swansea last summer, but a move to the Emirates fell through supposedly because he wasn’t considered Champions League quality. The 30-year-old has made a nonsense of that verdict since with his performances for Wales. Brilliant in a defiant defensive display when they gained a 0-0 draw away to Group B favourites Belgium in November, the Welsh captain was again outstanding in the 3-0 win in Israel which put Chris Coleman’s side top of the group. While Gareth Bale grabbed the headlines, Williams was superb at the back. He gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes – and won it back both times. Ashley Williams (right, pictured with Gareth Bale) was in impressive form during Wales' win against Israel . 2. John Terry is clearly a far more decent bloke than the various unsavoury episodes of his past would suggest. At the age of 34 and with a back that needs constant treatment, Chelsea’s captain could have done with a weekend off after playing all but four of Chelsea’s 45 games so far this season. But he gave up his time to play 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard’s All Star charity game supporting various good causes in the Merseyside area. Terry was also first to agree to play when Stiliyan Petrov ran out a sell-out game in Glasgow 18 months ago to raise funds for Leukaemia research. John Terry, pictured with Mario Balotelli, played 45 minutes of Steven Gerrard's All Star charity match . 3. Nathaniel Clyne might have to rein in some of the attacking instincts that have worked so well for him at Southampton when he’s wearing an England shirt. The 23-year-old is beginning to look like a natural at right back for Roy Hodgson after winning his third cap in the 4-0 win over Lithuania. But Hodgson clearly asked Clyne to keep his position to let opposite full back Leighton Baines do most of the marauding forward. The Everton man played 53 passes in the forward half, nearly twice the number (28) that Clyne did. England ace Nathaniel Clyne may have to keep his position in order to let Leighton Baines maraud forward . 4. Portugal might have gone top of Group I with their 2-1 victory over Serbia but new boss Fernando Santos could do with finding some fresh talent for his squad. Seven of the side that started the game, including Cristiano Ronaldo, were already in their country’s senior squad for Euro 2008. Portugal have failed to significantly freshen up their international squad since Euro 2008 . 5. There must be something about the north London air because if Harry Kane can’t stop scoring goals, the same is true of Olivier Giroud. Arsenal’s centre forward, who has 11 goals from 13 starts for his club since the start of 2015, was on the scoresheet again for France as they beat Denmark 2-0 in a Sunday night friendly. Kane, certain to get his first full England start in Italy after his dramatic 79-second debut goal against Lithuania, has 14 from 14 starts for Spurs since New Year’s Day. Harry Kane and Olivier Giroud flew the flag for north London by scoring for England and France respectively . 6. Andrew Robertson’s return from injury could be a key in helping Hull battle away from the relegation zone in the last two months of the season. The 21-year-old left back, picked up from Dundee United last summer by Steve Bruce for a bargain £2.8million, showed he is back to full match fitness with a dazzling display for Scotland. He played 100 passes in all during the win over Gibraltar, with 93 of them reaching a team-mate – and 49 of them in the attacking half of the field. Hull full back Andrew Roberton impressed against Gibraltar following his return to full match fitness . 7. Notts County say they are going to name a new manager this week with 50-year-old Dutchman Ricardo Moniz, once on Tottenham’s coaching staff, the current bookies’ favourite to get the job. They might be better off forgetting that and sticking with the experienced figure of Paul Hart who stepped up from working with the Academy for a one-off day as caretaker boss against relegation rivals Scunthorpe. The 61-year-old made a dramatic difference, lifting County out of the relegation zone with a 2-2 draw – and only a late Niall Canavan goal stopped him taking all three points. Notts County look set to appoint former Tottenham coach Ricardo Moniz following Shaun Derry's exit . 8. Midfielder Daniel Johnson was the big star when Aston Villa’s youngsters reached the quarter-finals of the NextGen series in 2012, but despite sitting on the bench as an unused sub for a few times could never find a way to the first team when Paul Lambert was in charge. He finally gave up trying to earn a Premier League chance in January and signed for Preston. After scoring in Sunday's 1-1 draw at Fleetwood, he now has six goals in 12 games – and must wonder how he’d have fared if he’d hung on for the Tim Sherwood regime. Daniel Johnson, pictured scoring against Fleetwood, has been in impressive form since leaving Aston Villa . 9. Mark Yates was sacked by Cheltenham in November as punishment for failing to match his achievements of previous seasons when he twice took the tiny club to the League Two play-offs. That worked well. Replacement Paul Buckle has since come and gone too, and the club are now bottom of the table following a 3-0 home defeat by Plymouth. Caretaker Russell Milton is in charge until the summer – but has so far overseen just one win in eight matches. Cheltenham have struggled in League Two since deciding to sack former manager Mark Yates . 10. Signing a goalscorer is the key to success at any level as Grimsby have proven by shaking up the race for promotion from the Vanarama Conference. Paul Hurst’s team looked nowhere near the race until they brought in 6ft 5ins centre forward Ollie Palmer on a loan deal from Mansfield – and haven’t looked back. The 23-year-old got his sixth from nine games in a 2-0 win at Welling that lifted them above Bristol Rovers on goal difference and just a point behind leaders Barnet. Ollie Palmer has scored six goals in nine games since joining Grimsby Town on a loan deal from Mansfield .

All article text:A troubled socialite who pleaded guilty to dealing drugs from her Range Rover in wealthy suburbs says there wasn't ‘anything difficult about it’ as she hit back at reports she may face up to 10 years behind bars. Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs. The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story recounting her double life as a drug dealer. Scroll down for video . Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs . 'I want to make one point very clear: 1000 pills + 94g of cocaine + $33,000 does not = 10 year gaol,' she wrote on Facebook. 'On averages, what I'm looking at is a 4 year head sentence with probably 2 years parole and 2 years gaol time... minus my 8 months served.' A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month. The program recreated a series of drug deals one day in November 2013 where she collected $5,750 between 4.40pm and 7.30pm from nine deliveries across Sydney. 'The money they're quoting that I made on the night re-enacted is gross of course, not profit,' Stockbridge wrote. 'I'm not sure how anyone could run a sophisticated drug ring from the front seat of their car? And besides, there really isn't anything difficult about it whatsoever.' The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story about her drug dealing . Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society . Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 and police found more than 380g of a substance containing MDMA, under 95g of a substance that contained cocaine, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash. Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers she had saved in her phone and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society. The court was also told she sent messages to customers with special deals, including 'buy two grams and get the third half price'. Police started recording evidence of the transactions by bugging her car in September 2013 - a fact Stockbridge says she knew and was careful about. A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month . Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 where police found drugs, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash . Stockbridge, who started Urban Society in 2010, revealed in her lengthy post that she turned to dealing drugs to help keep her company afloat. 'I believed so much in the concept I had developed with Urban Society, that I made the decision to liquidate everything I owned and worked for my whole life to fund the business,' she wrote. She said in the first year of business, it ended up costing her just under $250,000 - a sum she hadn't factored and ended up borrowing money from a friend. 'I then needed to pay that money back. One thing led to another and I had two choices: a) find a way to pay back the money or b) fold the company,' she said. 'After all the blood, sweat and tears and my whole life's work in this company, I wasn't about to loose (sic) everything so I did what I had to do to get myself out of a situation where I felt I was trapped.' Stockbridge, who started Urban Society in 2010, revealed in her lengthy post that she turned to dealing drugs to help keep her company afloat . Stockbridge said the people closest to her weren't aware of what she was doing and claims it wasn't anything to do with greed. She hit back at comments made by Daily Mail Australia that her staff were left high and dry when she was arrested in 2013. 'Naturally, because I was arrested, I couldn't pay them. There was no-one who could have done this for me as it would have involved chasing money. They took everything else off me,' she wrote. 'I’m sick of hearing comments insinuating that I didn't pay them on purpose. I do intend to pay them back that last week's pay and I am chasing outstanding money and getting into trouble for it. 'It was never my intention to hurt anyone. I was just trying to fix a bad situation and I didn't do a very good job of it. Now I will pay for that error of judgement for the rest of my life.'

All article text:Footage has emerged of the incredible moment an apparently intoxicated man fell between two moving subway carriages in Washington D.C. only to come out unscathed. Security cameras inside Metro's Mount Vernon station captured the incident around 5pm on Sunday March 1. The man can bee seen stumbling around the platform, obviously unsteady on his feet, before tumbling straight through the gap between two subway cars. The fall occurs right as the doors are closing the the train is preparing to leave the station. Unsteady: This is the moment the apparently intoxicated man (left) loses his balances and goes to fall into the cap between the two carriages . Fall: The video shows the passenger falling straight into the space between the connected carriages . Down: The man slips straight into the gap, as fellow passengers (right) watch on with shock . As the man falls, shocked onlookers try to help, only to realize the train is alighting. One man can be seen in the video panicking and holding his hands in the air. However, one the train passes and people scurry to the platform's edge, believing a tragedy has just occurred, they suddenly see the man get to his feet and continue stumbling. He somehow fell into the zone outside of the rails known as the 'area of refuge'. The fellow passengers quickly pull the man up to the platform. Police arrived to assist the man. He suffered only minor injuries from the fall. Safe: People on the platform can be seen pulling the man back up onto the station after the train departs . Perhaps more startling is the fact that incidents such as these happen every week, according to a Metro spokesman. 'It's important for riders to monitor themselves and also look out for their friends,' Metro spokesman Dan Stessel told NBC Washington. 'If you go out for drinks with a group and someone is clearly not able to walk properly, maybe that's the time to order a cab or an Uber, that sort of thing.' Encouraging a fallen passenger to roll into the area of refuge is a 'last resort', Stessel told The Washington Post. However in this case it seemed to be accidental. Miraculous: The man managed to fall into the space between the platform and the tracks known as the 'area of refuge'

All article text:A deadly strain of bird flu has been found in a Minnesota commercial turkey flock. The virus devastated a flock of 15,000 turkeys in western Minnesota's Pope County. It's the same highly pathogenic H5N2 strain of avian influenza that's been confirmed in backyard and wild birds in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. However, it's the first appearance of the strain in the Mississippi flyway [states around the Mississippi river] said Dr. Bill Hartmann, Minnesota's state veterinarian. Fewer than 100 of the turkeys were still alive by Thursday, Hartmann said. The flock has been quarantined and the remaining birds were being killed. A flock of 15,000 turkeys was wiped out on a farm in Minnesota in a week by a deadly strain of bird flu carried by wild waterfowl that are not sickened by it. The strain has already been found in the Pacific Northwest . Dr. Bill Hartmann (left) said that this is the first appearance of the strain in the area. Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson (right) said: 'We can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best' No other commercial flocks are nearby, he said, but 'backyard flocks' within a 10-kilometer area (approximately six miles) were being tested for the disease. The virus is carried by wild waterfowl that aren't sickened by it. The incubation period is approximately 21 days. 'We're encouraged that we'll be able to prevent the spread of the disease,' Hartmann said. 'We should be able to contain this without much difficulty.' 'If we can get through the next 21 days without finding anything, we should be in good shape,' Agriculture Commissioner Dave Frederickson added. Minnesota is the nation's top turkey producer, with industry groups claiming to produce some 46 million turkeys each year worth around $750 million. Frederickson said about 8 per cent of that production, or $92 million worth, was exported in 2013. He acknowledged that those exports could take a hit, as poultry exports from states in the Northwest already have. 'We're very cognizant of that,' Frederickson said. 'We can only prepare for the worst and hope for the best.' The risk to humans is low, state and federal officials announced on Thursday. Minnesota Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger stressed there is no danger to the general public . Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger said the only humans at risk were four people who worked directly with the infected flock and they will be monitored. However, no human infections from this strain have been detected anywhere, he said. 'There are no food safety concerns at this time,' Ehlinger said. 'This is not a threat to the general public.' Hartmann said he was prohibited by law from identifying the farm or saying where it's located in Pope County. Nearly all commercial turkey operations keep their birds inside large barns and they never go outside. Hartmann said that was the true for the affected farm, too. He said turkeys in only one of the farm's four barns got sick. Farm workers found 70 dead turkeys on February 26 and notified the state the next day when hundreds died. The state got confirmation of the virus from a U.S. Department of Agriculture lab on Wednesday night. The state veterinarian said it was possible the virus may have been tracked into the barns from fecal material left by infected wild birds. It's also possible for infected waterfowl to transmit the virus to shore birds that might then get into a turkey barn, he added.

All article text:Scientists say sharing sad emotions helps women bond. Pictured: Film The Fault In Our Stars . It has long been a mystery to men why so many women enjoy watching tear jerker movies with their friends. But now scientists have come up with a suggestion – sharing sad emotions helps women bond. A research team at Cardiff University found that by sharing their emotions women found the happy parts of films more joyful and the sad bits less sad. Job van der Schalk, a psychologist at Cardiff University, said: ‘Our findings suggest that a negative emotional experience such as watching a ‘weepy’ is more positive when it is shared with a friend. ‘And, at the same time, a positive emotional experience, such as watching a ‘romcom’, should equally be more pleasant when shared.’ The study involved 30 pairs of female friends aged between 20 and 33 who were shown emotionally powerful images and asked to rate them on a scale from ‘very negative’ to ‘very positive’. The scientists put one of each pair in a brain scanner to monitor their reactions, and the volunteers were also asked to view and rate the images while on their own and also while together. The researchers found the images were seen more positively when the pairs were together, The Sunday Times reported. The study, published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, said: ‘When people go to the cinema to watch a film, they ... anticipate a positive subjective impact of sharing this emotional experience.’ And Hollywood success seems to back the theory. The 2008 film Marley and Me, which surrounds a couple’s relationship with their dog, took £160m at the global box office, and last year’s film The Fault in Our Stars - about two teenage cancer patients who find love - took more than £200m. Aggie Romeril, 22, a London beauty manager, said: ‘I think we’re a “stream it and weep” age. You scroll through Netflix, find who’s got the biggest laptop and bundle into a housemate’s bed for a sob session.’ Marley and Me, which surrounds a couple’s relationship with their dog, took £160m at the global box office.

All article text:Photos of US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert meeting with the country's leaders have emerged for the first time since the envoy was attacked by a knife-wielding pro-North Korean activist. Lippert is recovering at Severance Hospital in Seoul, and was able to meet with US Navy Admiral James Winnefeld as well as members of South Korea's ruling and opposition parties. Police are charging the activist, Kim Ki-jong, 55, with murder after he slashed the ambassador while screaming demands for Korean reunification. The attack Thursday on Lippert, at a forum about reunification, prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' that left deep gashes and damaged the ambassador's tendons and nerves. Scroll down for video . Recovering: US ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert, (left), meets with US Navy Admiral James Winnefeld following an attack by a knife-wielding activist who slashed the envoy's face and arm . Hospital visits: Photos of Lippert meeting with politicians including opposition leader Moon Jae-In (left) emerged on Sunday as the ambassador was recovering at Severance Hospital in Seoul . On the mend: Leaders from the ruling Saenuri party met with Lippert on Sunday as authorities work to investigate activist attacker Kim Ki-jong . North Korean state media said the attack was 'deserved punishment'. Lippert, 42, is recovering well but has complained of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in a televised briefing. Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and say he could be out of the hospital on Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved . Kim was detained on Friday and police seized 30 copies of books and print materials from his home, some of which were pro-North Korea, according to Yonhap News. Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood . Taken by surprise: Injured Ambassador Lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by Kim Thursday morning . Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against Kim Ki-jong, who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification . Having material in support of Pyongyang is not illegal, but distributing material propagandizing the isolated communist regime is banned in the South. Authorities plan on charging Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction. A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathizing with the North Korean government, was being considered. The anti-US activist has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. While the North seemed to praise the attacks in its previous comments, its Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said Sunday that linking the slashing to its government was part of an 'anti-DPRK smear campaign'. In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly attacked  Lippert before he gave a speech at a breakfast meeting. Above, the anti-US demonstrator being taken into custody on Thursday . Aftermath:  Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage after being treated for his injuries, which include slashing wounds and nerve damage . Kim, who has a long history of anti-US protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual US-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials. While most South Koreans look at the US presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history. Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops on the peninsula, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea. 'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said. Right before:  Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning . Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong US military presence. Above, US-South Korea alliance supporters . Divided peninsula: South Korean protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center and right, the late leaders Kim Jong Il, second from left, and Kim Il Sung, left . Stained: Police say the ambassador was about to make a speech when Kim pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife. Above, investigators survey the blood-spattered table on Thursday . The attack raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation would show up for the group's breakfast meeting, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. Outspoken: Kim Ki-jong reportedly has a history of public outbursts. Pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest . US ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post. Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Middle East. Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack. However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack. The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April. North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's attack reflected the South Korean people's protests against the US for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills. US Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the US 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.' Security: South Korean police stand guard outside Gangbuk Samsung hospital where Ambassador Lippert was taken after the attack. Doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face . Protection: South Korean police patrol outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on March 5. The protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country . Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities. Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful. But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate. Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. His wife gave birth in Korea and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. An elderly man offered dog meat to the recovering ambassador, but it was rejected because of hospital safety rules. Canine meat is thought to help heal wounds and is commonly offered to surgery patients. While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries. In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II. When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel. The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries. Above, American troops board a boat bound for South Korean at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 . However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea. Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers. While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land. The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953. Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready. However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West. Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world. According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership.

All article text:Can't choose between a bike, scooter or a skateboard for the commute to work? Now you don't have to, as inventors have come up with a contraption that combines all three into one. The device, called a Sbyke, offers riders young and old the ability to enjoy the three modes of transport simulataneously in a bizarre contraption that has cherry-picked features from each. It has a set of handlebars and a big front wheel like a bike, but the back section looks more like a skateboard. The rider propels themselves as if they were on a scooter. Scroll down for video . Two Californian inventors have come up with a new type of transport. The Sbyke (shown) is a mix of a bike, scooter and a skateboard. It has handlebars and a big front wheel, but the back has a flat section . Its makers say riding a Sbyke feels nothing like a conventional scooter - instead it is more like 'skiing on a pavement'. Ford may be known for its cars, but at this year’s Mobile World Congress the auto giant also unveiled a pair of electric bikes. Both prototypes are powered by 200-watt motors, fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car, and with pedal assist, help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph (25km/h). The bikes are part of an experiment by Ford called Handle on Mobility, which aims to make journeys safer and more efficient. The bikes, called MoDe:Me and MoDe:Pro, are based on designs by Ford employees and take inspiration from technology seen in cars. For example, both bikes are fitted with rear-facing ultrasonic sensors. These sensors link with the handlebars to discreetly alert the rider when a car is about to overtake using subtle vibrations. The Sbyke is the brainchild of racing drivers Bart and Steve Wilson from San Clemente California who came up with the design as a way to get around the pit lanes at a race track quickly. The Wilson brothers then teamed up with designer Brad Wernli and together they built the first prototype in Brad's garage before launching the product worldwide. The Sbyke comes in two main models - a mini one for children under seven and a bigger version for older kids and adults. The smaller one costs £99.95 ($149) and the bigger is £159.95 ($249) from sbykeuk.co.uk. Shaun Turner from Hertfordshire, director of Sbyke UK, said: 'The Sbyke is the evolution of the kick scooter - a brand new revolutionary hybrid scooter which takes the best elements from scootering, skateboarding and cycling and rolls them all into one. 'Although it looks a little like a bike, a skateboard and a scooter all mixed together, it rides unlike any of them. 'Sbyke takes the best attributes of each and combines them into something totally unique. 'Imagine skiing and surfing but on the pavement. That's the sensation Sbyke can give you.' The rider, young or old, propels themselves like a scooter. The inventors say using it is like 'skiing on a pavement'. A smaller version costs £99.95 and a bigger version is £159.95 . The large front wheel supposedly helps propel the Sbyke up to five times further per push than a conventional scooter (left), while a patented rear wheel steer system apparently allows for 'amazingly tight turns' (right). Ahandbrake can also be used to keep it at a standstill .
