All article text:The U.S. government on Thursday asked an appeals court to lift a temporary hold on President Barack Obama's executive action to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, arguing it can't wait for the judge who blocked the action to make a ruling on a similar request. Justice Department attorneys filed an emergency motion with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, to lift a preliminary injunction issued last month by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas. The injunction had been issued on the request of a coalition of 26 states that filed a lawsuit to overturn Obama's immigration plan. OFF TO COURT: President Barack Obama has responded to a Texas judge's injunction halting his immigration executive actions by demanding an appeals court overrule him . HERE COMES THE JUDGE: Federal jurist Andrew Hanen called the Obama administration on the carpet and put the brakes on the president's immigration plan . The states, led by Texas, argue that Obama's action was unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement, health care and education. DECISION TIME: Federal Judge Priscilla Owen will likely make the call on whether to overturn Hanen, her former law school classmate . The injunction was intended to stall Obama's actions – which would spare from deportation as many as 5 million people who are in the U.S. illegally – while the lawsuit progresses through the courts. Many Republicans in Congress and states led by Republicans oppose the action, saying Obama overstepped his authority as president. Obama said he had to act because Congress has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The Justice Department had asked Hanen to lift the injunction while the case was appealed to the 5th Circuit. But Hanen put that request on hold pending a hearing on March 19 to review allegations the government misled him about the implementation of part of the immigration plan. In their 21-page motion, Justice Department attorneys called the injunction 'unprecedented and wrong' and argued lifting it was crucial as the order 'irreparably interferes with (the Homeland Security Department's) ability to protect the Homeland and secure our borders.' Justice Department attorneys said that if the injunction is not lifted, it should at least apply either only to Texas or to the 26 states that sued. 'President Obama's unconstitutional use of executive power to accomplish what he couldn't do in Congress sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the fabric of our Republic,' Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement responding to the Justice Department's emergency motion. 'The state of Texas and a bipartisan coalition of 25 other states will continue to oppose the President's unilateral and lawless actions,' Paxton added. A coalition of 14 states, including California and Iowa, and the District of Columbia filed a motion on Thursday with the 5th Circuit in support of lifting the injunction. They argued the immigration actions will benefit states through increased tax revenues and improved public safety. But Texas has on its side a longer list: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Legal experts say the 5th Circuit is known to be fairly conservative, and is likely to deny the Justice Department's request. Ultimately, it could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. PLAINTIFF: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors . ANGER: Conservatives have bristled at the idea of the White House tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay . At next week's hearing, Hanen was set to have Justice Department attorneys explain why the federal government granted three-year deportation reprieves as well as work permits to 100,000 individuals before Hanen's Feb. 16 injunction. Attorneys had previously said federal officials wouldn't accept such requests until Feb. 18. The Justice Department has said the reprieves and work permits were granted under the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which was not halted by Hanen's injunction. DACA protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. In a separate court document filed with Hanen's court on Thursday, the Justice Department said the acknowledgement that some individuals were granted reprieves under 2012 DACA guidelines does 'not bear on the resolution' of the pending request before the judge to lift the injunction. Hanen's injunction put on the hold an expansion of DACA as well as a program that would extend deportation protections to parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years.

Ground truth Summary: 26 states sued in federal court and won a temporary injunction preventing the White House from mainstreaming more than 5 million illegal immigrants .
Judge Andrew Hanen put on the brakes, saying the policy could cause harms that it would be impossible to undo .
Now the Obama administration is going over Hanen's head to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, demanding it overturn Hanen .
Obama wants to give Social Security numbers, green cards and work permits to some who are in the country illegally, and guarantee them they won't be deported for at least two years .

All article text:The Justice Department has indicted a former Ole Miss student on civil rights charges after he allegedly hung a noose on a statue of his university's first black student. Graeme Phillip Harris, 20, of Alpharetta, Georgia, has been indicted on one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights and one count of using a threat of force to intimidate African-American students. The indictment is connected to a February 2014 incident in which a noose and a former Georgia flag, prominently featuring the Confederate battle emblem, were placed on a statue of James Meredith. Scroll down for video . Graeme Phillip Harris, 20, of Alpharetta, Georgia, was indicted on  civil rights charges after allegedly putting a noose and Confederate symbols on a state of the first black student to go to Ole Miss . The student faces up to 11 years in prison for conspiracy to violate civil rights and using a threat of force to intimidate African-American students. He has reportedly transferred to a new school in Georgia . Harris, who is white, was an Ole Miss student when the noose was left on the statue. It wasn't immediately clear whether Harris had an attorney to contact for comment on his behalf. University spokesman Danny Blanton said Friday that Harris is no longer enrolled and that university officials turned the case over to federal prosecutors and deferred to their judgment.. Harris has transferred to University of North Georgia – Oconee Campus, according to the Daily Mississippian. He is free on bond, though his movement is restricted to areas of Georgia and Mississippi. James Meredith, who integrated the University of Mississippi under federal protection a half-century ago, says it's a shame that state authorities deferred to the federal government to bring charges. Mr Meredith, who is 81 and lives in Jackson, said state authorities should have pursed charges. 'What it is saying is that the only possible justice for a black in the state of Mississippi is the federal government and if there's anything that we don't need it's that being our only means of expecting justice,' Mr Meredith said in a phone interview Friday. 'I think Mississippi is better than that. If it's not better than that, it should be made better than that.' The Lafayette County district attorney said in 2014 that state charges wouldn't be filed because no state laws were broken. Mississippi's hate crime law requires an underlying crime for additional charges. Because the statute wasn't marred or broken, prosecutors said typical vandalism charges didn't apply. James Meredith (statue of him in center during anti-racism demonstration) said that state authorities should have filed charges rather than only the Justice Department . Mr Meredith (center) was the first black student to attend Ole Miss in 1962 but has said that the statue of him erected in 2006 should be taken down . The punishment for conspiracy to violate civil rights ranges to up to ten years in prison. Threat of force to intimidate is punishable by up to one year in prison. In 1962, anti-integration protests erupted into violence and Meredith had to be escorted by armed federal agents as he enrolled under court order as the first black student at the university. In announcing the indictment of Harris on Friday, Attorney General Eric Holder said of the noose incident:  'This shameful and ignorant act is an insult to all Americans and a violation of our most strongly-held values. 'No one should ever be made to feel threatened or intimidated because of what they look like or who they are,' Holder said in a news release. 'By taking appropriate action to hold wrongdoers accountable, the Department of Justice is sending a clear message that flagrant infringements of our historic civil rights will not go unnoticed or unpunished.' Hundreds of Ole Miss students attended a racial reconciliation rally on campus after the 2014 incident. The federal authorities' investigation into the incident, which involved two other freshmen students, is ongoing . The university, which replaced its Confederate officer mascot with a bear (pictured) in 2010, has had a string of racism-related incidents, including a protest on Barack Obama's reelection night with racist epithets . 'It has taken time, but the process has worked and I'm confident justice will be done,' Ole Miss Chancellor Dan Jones said in a statement Friday. 'I am thankful for the strong, united response of our university community to the desecration of the James Meredith statue last year, confirming our university values of civility and respect.' The national office of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity suspended its Ole Miss chapter after three of the chapter's members were accused of leaving the noose and flag on the Meredith statue. Names of the three white freshmen students from Georgia were not released at the time. Federal authorities' investigation into the incident is still ongoing. The recent indictment against Harris comes as another fraternity chapter, Sigma Alphia Epsilon at University of Oklahoma, was suspended after a video showed them singing a racist song about lynching on a bus. Members of the organization were found to have learned the chant informally at a national leadership cruise. Hundreds of students at Ole Miss attended a racial reconciliation rally after the incident at the beginning of last year . Mr Meredith said that his statue had been used as 'a public relations tool for the powers that be at Ole Miss,' which has continued to see racism (file photo, 2012) Other fraternities are currently being investigated for allegedly racist behavior. The Meredith statue was erected in 2006 near the main administrative building at Ole Miss, the Lyceum. In a 2012 autobiography, Mr Meredith said the university should destroy the statue because he said it trivialized his effort to destroy a system of white supremacy that had long dominated Mississippi, his native state. 'I have become a piece of art, a tourist attraction, a soothing image on the civil rights tour of the South, a public relations tool for the powers that be at Ole Miss, and feel-good icon of brotherly love and racial reconciliation, frozen in gentle docility,' Mr Meredith wrote. The university banned Confederate battle flags from football games in 2003 and changed its mascot, Confederate Colonel Reb, for a black bear in 2010. White students at Ole Miss in 2012 started a protest the night of President Barack Obama's reelection in which they burned his signs and racial epithets were heard being shouted.

All article text:London (CNN)Britain's Royal Mint has unveiled a new portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, which will gradually appear on coins in the United Kingdom. It is the fifth portrait of the British monarch to be used on coins during her 63-year reign. Production of the new coins began Monday, and they will appear in circulation later this year, the Royal Mint said. The new design depicts the Queen wearing the royal diamond diadem crown from her coronation. Artist Jody Clark said he researched images online when deciding which crown to use. "I think it's the most familiar and I wanted to make some clear distinctions between the (most recent) portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley FRBS, as Her Majesty really hasn't aged too much in the years since." "FRBS" refers to Rank-Broadley's fellowship in the Royal British Society of Sculptors, a professional organization that advances the art of sculpture. A panel selected Clark's design from a number by specialist designers across Britain invited to submit anonymous work. The design was then submitted to the British chancellor and the Queen for final approval. Clark is a member of the Royal Mint's team of designers and engravers. He is the first mint engraver to produce a definitive royal coinage portrait in more than a century, the organization said. "Jody's achievement is something that we can celebrate as a proud moment for The Royal Mint. Capturing a portrait on the surface of a coin demands the utmost skill, and is one of the most challenging disciplines of the coin designer's art," chief executive Adam Lawrence said. "This change of royal portrait will make 2015 a vintage year for UK coins, and it will be hugely exciting for us all to see the new design appear on the coins we use every day." Royal coinage portraits are usually updated every 15 to 20 years, the Royal Mint said. The last portrait was created by sculptor Rank-Broadley in 1998.

All article text:Albert Park - Australian Grand Prix . It seems incredible to think Sepang has been hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix since 1999, but it appears one of Herman Tilke's circuit designs has actually become part of the furniture on the F1 calendar. Sepang's sweeping nature can be a challenge to the drivers, but the biggest factor that can have an outcome on the race is the highly unpredictable weather which can leave plans and strategy in absolute ruins. In the past, race day always threw up a challenge whatever the conditions. If it wasn't the flash storm catching out the drivers, it was the hot and extremely humid sun which sapped the energy from the drivers. A later start time since 2009 has limited the factor played by the sun, but race day tends to be an exciting affair as Sportsmail looks back at the archive and memories from the Malaysian Grand Prix. For Albert Park memories I included a quiz half-way down the page but this week we will start with one. The Sepang Circuit hasn't changed its layout since the first race in 1999 but in which year was this overhead shot of the track taken? (Answer at the bottom of the page) 'Not only is Michael the best No 1 driver - he is also the best No 2.' Eddie Irvine (right) knew exactly who to thank after he won the first ever Malaysian Grand Prix in 1999. Michael Schumacher dominated the race after returning from a mid-season leg break, and allowed Irvine to win to aid his title bid. Mika Hakkinen (bottom left) finished third but would go on to win the 1999 world championship . Leading the pack under the safety car and heading into the final corner is Michael Schumacher ahead of Ferrari team-mate Rubens Barrichello in 2000. Schumacher would go on to win the race with Barrichello finishing third behind the McLaren of David Coulthard . Schumacher had already been crowned world champion in 2000, but the double Ferrari podium allowed the team to clinch the constructors' championship. Here both drivers (with THAT red hair) celebrate with test driver Luca Badoer (right) and team boss Jean Todt (bottom right) The 2000 Malaysian Grand Prix was a joyous occasion for Ferrari, but it was the end of the road for Johnny Herbert who driving for Jaguar competed in his final race. The Brit's sad eyes appear to reflect that an 11-year career as an F1 driver was about to come to an end . Legend has it that the 2001 Minardi was so slow that Fernando Alonso needed a push up the hill from a track marshall to make it round the circuit during qualifying. Giancarlo Fisichella passes in his Benetton Renault which fared little better performance wise over the season . Race day in 2001 was hit by a flash storm, and clever tactics by Ferrari saw them change tyres at the right time before claiming a one-two with Schumacher (front) leading home Barrichello. It was the first year where the race took place in its now traditional early-season slot . Juan Pablo Montoya (complete with a Ferrari nosecone for company) runs his Williams off the circuit in 2002 after a collision with Michael Schumacher. Despite the Colombian not being at fault for the clash, it was he who would pick up a controversial drive-through penalty . A quick glance in his mirror at the first corner and Giancarlo Fisichella will be stunned to find his team-mate Takuma Sato climbing all over the back of his Jordan in 2002. This was just one lap after Schumacher and Montoya collided . Benefiting most from the Montoya-Schumacher incident was Ralf Schumacher who led home a Williams one-two in 2002. It proved a false dawn for the team as Ferrari went on to win 14 of the following 15 races during the campaign . Heinz-Harald Frentzen appears to be a little distracted as Miss India of 2001, Celina Jaitley, sits on the front tyre of his Sauber in 2003 . Antonio Pizzonia had clearly learned nothing from Takuma Sato's first-corner antics in 2002 when he took to the air a year later in his Jaguar. Unfortunately it was the Williams of Juan Pablo Montoya who was again the innocent victim as his rear wing takes the full force of the impact . Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello waves hello to the future of Formula One after McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen celebrates his first ever grand prix win in 2003. Joining the pair is Renault's Fernando Alonso (who started from pole position) and was also celebrating his first podium in the sport . Drink up, Jenson! The 2004 season was all about Michel Schumacher's dominance but a sub-plot from it was the emergence of Button who here celebrates his first Formula One podium with second-placed Montoya (left) and race winner Schumacher . Another Malaysian Grand Prix, and another Williams taking a battering. This time it is in the final corner heading into the pit-straight as Mark Webber collides with Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault - putting both out of the race - which was won by the Italian's team-mate, Fernando Alonso . Having been at fault the previous year for the crash with Webber, Fisichella (left) stormed back in 2006 to take his final career win. The Italian led home Alonso in a Renault one-two with the duo celebrating with team boss Flavio Briatore . Fernando Alonso will mark his McLaren return by making his second debut with the team this weekend, but he's already driven at Sepang for the outfit back in 2007. Here the Spaniard tackles a fast double right hander with the iconic start-finish stadium section in the background . It wasn't often that you found Alonso and Hamilton looking happy in the same picture during 2007 but here they are all smiles for McLaren following a one-two led home by the double world champion. Hamilton's second place finish came after a third on his debut in Melbourne . Kimi Raikkonen was world champion, but here it's Felipe Massa leading the Ferrari cars round the first corner of the 2008 grand prix. Raikkonen would win the race with his team-mate retiring, but it was the Brazilian who would lead Ferrari's title charge during the season . The track is dry for now but not for long as dark clouds loom over Sepang during the 2009 race. Here Nico Rosberg pilots his Williams around the first corner in front of Jarno Trulli's Toyota and the Brawn of Jenson Button . As a monsoon hit the track, Button took advantage to storm to the front ahead of Toyota's Timo Glock (who would finish third). As conditions became too severe, the race was halted after just 31 laps with Button pronounced the winner and all drivers receiving half-points . Michael Schumacher retired after just nine laps with a wheel fault for Mercedes in 2010 and there appears to be no shortage of marshalls offering a lift back to the paddock for the seven-time world champion following his return to the sport after three seasons away . It's usually a one-finger salute from Sebastian Vettel after he wins a race, but he isn't celebrating second place here. The world champion has just recorded two straight wins at the start of 2011 in a season he would go on to dominate before claiming his second world title . All eyes were on Sergio Perez in 2012 after the Sauber driver narrowly missed out on a famous win having made a late error in trying to catch and pass Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. McLaren's Lewis Hamilton congratulates the Mexican on a fine drive to finish second. At the end of the season, it would be Perez replacing the Brit at the Woking outfit following Hamilton's departure to Mercedes . Well this isn't the happiest podium you will ever see. Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton is sensing the tension in the air after race winner Sebastian Vettel (centre) controversially ignored team orders by passing team-mate Mark Webber during the 2013 Malaysian Grand Prix . Vettel and Hamilton look on at Webber during the champagne 'celebration' as the furious Australian hit-out at his team-mate for ignoring the now infamous 'multi-21' order - a team call that indicated the Red Bull drivers held position with Webber in front of Vettel . It was easier for Hamilton to celebrate on the podium in 2014 as he stormed to his first victory of the season ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg . 1999: Eddie Irvine (Ferrari) 2000: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2001: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2002: Ralf Schumacher (Williams) 2003: Kimi Raikkonen (McLaren) 2004: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2005: Fernando Alonso (Renault) 2006: Giancarlo Fisichella (Renault) 2007: Fernando Alonso (McLaren) 2008: Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) 2009: Jenson Button (Brawn) 2010: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2011: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2012: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) 2013: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2014: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) Bold indicates driver still active on Formula One grid . Quiz answer - What year was the first photograph on this page taken? The overhead track shot was taken on the Thursday before the 2000 Malaysian Grand Prix .

All article text:A teenager walking in the rain with her fiance died when he fumbled with their umbrella and accidentally pushed her into the road. Grace Dyson, 18, fell under the wheels of a van – that was being driven by her uncle. The chances of the accident happening and the coincidence of a relative being behind the wheel were ‘unbelievable’, a policeman told an inquest yesterday. Engaged: Grace Dyson (left), 18, was walking in the rain to a fish and chip shop with her fiancé Jason Booth (right) - when the tip of his brolly became caught in a crevice in a wall . Accident: Grace, who was walking with Mr Booth (left, pictured outside the court today), fell into oncoming traffic at the same second her uncle Ivan Beaumont (right, also outside court), 41, was passing in his van . Miss Dyson, an apprentice administrator, ‘wobbled and slipped like when you turn over on your ankle’, and the van driver had ‘no time to brake’, Detective Sergeant Noel Lowden told the hearing. The accident left Grace, a talented linguist, with ‘non-survivable head injuries’ as the split-second knock threw her under the Nissan Cabstar, Huddersfield Coroner’s Court was told. Miss Dyson’s heartbroken fiance, Jason Booth, 21, said he lost her in a ‘split second’. The couple, who had been dating for 14 months, were heading to a fish and chip shop in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, when tragedy struck. Mr Booth, a chemistry student at Huddersfield University, was holding an umbrella over them both as they walked along a pavement in the next-door village of Thongsbridge. Tributes: Flowers at the scene following the fatal crash in August last year in Thongsbridge, West Yorkshire . Remembered: A flag for the metal band Rammstein was among the tributes left at the scene in Thongsbridge . He told the inquest: ‘It was raining quite badly. It was quite a big umbrella with an elongated handle. ‘When we set off the brolly was up. On the side of the pavement we were walking down there was a dry stone wall - I was nearest to the wall and Grace was on my left. Couple: Chemistry student Mr Booth said he and 18-year-old Grace (pictured above) were ‘inseparable’ ‘The metal end of the umbrella got stuck in a crevice in the wall. It made me jolt to the left hand side - I remember seeing Grace’s foot slip over the edge. I think that’s when she fell.’ Driving past at that moment was labourer Ivan Beaumont – Miss Dyson’s uncle – who was coming home from work. He told police he had spotted his niece and was about to wave to her when she toppled into the road and under his Nissan Cabstar van. A passer-by rushed over to help but said there was little that could be done for Miss Dyson. She was pronounced dead by the emergency services when they arrived. Mr Beaumont was questioned by police but not charged. Det Sgt Lowden said: ‘He had no time. She fell in the road and hit her with his van. It all happened so quick and she went under the wheel’. He added: ‘It’s a tragic set of circumstances that Grace lost her footing at that exact time. Sadly this proved fatal. The chances of this occurring are unbelievable.’ Mr Beaumont was questioned by police but no charges were ever brought. Eyewitness Lesley Hardy, who was driving on the other side of the narrow road at the time, said he stopped as soon as he saw the crash. In a statement read in court, the driver said he had spotted a male dressed in Gothic clothes and a ‘black coat’ in the road. He added: ‘I realised this was not a black coat, but a woman. My wife and I got out of the car and went over to where she was. The male was very disorientated and seriously distressed. Struck: At the split second Grace (above) stumbled, her uncle told police he said he had just spotted his niece and was about to try to catch her eye to wave . Praised: Grace was a ‘homebird’ with a ‘natural flair for languages’ and was talented at art, her mother said . ‘There was no movement or sound from the lady in the road. Her body was sort of twisted. I spoke to the passenger who said it was his niece - I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. ‘It didn’t look like she was going to survive. A while later I heard she had died.’ Recording a road traffic accident verdict, Assistant Coroner Mary Burke said: ‘No one could have anticipated that this was going to happen. No one could have changed the pattern of events. 'It happened in fractions of a second. There was no way Jason would have predicted what was going to happen. I offer my deepest condolences to you.’ Grace’s mother Lydia Beaumont told the court her daughter was a ‘homebird’ with a ‘natural flair for languages’ and was talented at art. She added: ‘Grace and Jason were very close - they did everything together.’ After last August’s tragedy, Mr Booth wrote a tribute to his fiancee on Facebook, saying: ‘Life is unbelievably cruel at times, but everyone that ever met you will hold you in their memories as that crazy but absolutely lovable person that you were. ‘I could never thank you enough for the incredible memories you’ve given me, that I’ll forever hold tightly to me. I will be forever honoured and proud that I have your amazing self in my life.’

All article text:Going to the cinema once or twice a week could hold the key to preventing dementia, researchers claim. Watching a funny film with a good plot helps to stimulate the brain and prevent the build-up of harmful deposits, they believe. Crucially, discussing the film with friends afterwards helps to keep the mind active and guards against the formation of the plaques that cause Alzheimer’s. In a bid to prove their thesis, academics from Southampton University are launching a study involving 40 elderly patients - half of whom will go to the cinema once or twice a week. Scroll down for video . Researchers say watching a funny film with a good plot helps to stimulate the brain and could be the key to preventing dementia. Stock photo . They will then have a detailed discussion about the plot, the characters and what they made of the film overall over a cup of coffee or tea afterwards. Dr Roxana Carare, who is leading the research, believes this intellectual stimulation can prevent the build-up of toxins in the brain, called Amyloid-β, which lead to Alzheimer’s disease. ‘In order to keep the elimination of these toxins efficient, you need to keep the walls of the blood vessels healthy,’ she said. ‘You can do this by exercising of the brain or stimulation. ‘The films will stimulate the brain because of what you see and hear and crucially because of the discussions afterwards. ‘The bottom line is we’re trying to prevent these toxins accumulating in the brain by keeping the blood vessels pumping and brain active.’ Dr Carare, an Associate Professor in Cerebrovascular Ageing, cited the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, starring Dame Judi Dench and Bill Nighy, as an ideal film. It tells the story of seven pensioners spending their retirement in a hotel in India Patients would easily be able to relate the characters who are not dissimilar in age and it is both funny and intellectually stimulating. However, she said sci fi films were not ideal, as patients may lose concentration and find them difficult to believe. Amyloid plaques start to form as the walls of the blood vessels in the brain start to stiffen and lose their ability to get rid of toxins. To prove their thesis, academics from Southampton University are launching a study involving 40 elderly patients and will send half of them to the cinema once or twice a week. Stock photo . Some patients have weaker blood vessel walls - possibly due to their genes - and gradually, the toxins build up. They create deposits called plaques which damage the surrounding cells and cause Alzheimer’s Disease, the most common form of dementia. Dr Carare’s study is due to begin this summer and will involve 40 elderly patients who have mild memory and concentration problems, but have not been diagnosed with dementia. Half will go to the cinema or watch an older film together on a large screen once or twice a week and have a discussion for about an hour afterwards. All patients will also undergo memory and concentration assessments once or twice a month to see if the films are improving the function of their brains. An estimated 850,000 people in Britain have dementia and 1 in 3 of us will develop the illness during our lifetime. But drug companies have failed to find a cure despite millions being invested in research over the past few decades. Last month a major report warned that the search for effective treatments had been hampered by ‘funding fatigue’. The World Innovation Research Summit said drugs companies were less willing to pay for trials following a series of expensive failures.

All article text:Michelle Obama has touched down in Tokyo in what is being described as a 'makeup call' after she 'snubbed' the Japanese by failing to accompany her husband during his state visit to Japan last year. In a further patching up of relations, Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe, is due to make a reciprocal visit to America next month. Mrs Obama's previous no-show  upset members of the Japanese establishment so deeply that one politician, Kazuyuki Hamada, made the outrageous claim that the Obamas were getting divorced, as the president had been using Secret Service agents to cover for his extramarital affairs. Scroll down for video . Big in Japan: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama waves upon her arrival at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, wearing a green printed dress from Kenzo’s Fall 2014 collection, which costs around $700, offset by a chunky belt. Her visit is being described as a 'makeup call' after she snubbed the country last year . Diplomacy: Michelle Obama meets and greets upon arriving at Tokyo airport. Last year, she failed to accompany her husband on an official visit to Japan, which reportedly caused offence . Thaw: Michelle Obama will reportedly be attempting to build bridges with Japan after snubbing the country last year. Next month, the Prime Minister of Japan will visit the U.S. in a move to further patch up relations . Michelle Obama descends the stairs of Air Force One upon her arrival at Haneda international airport in Tokyo on Wednesday . Mrs Obama's trip comes at a time of high tension for Americans in Japan, as Tokyo police investigate phone calls threatening to kill U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and Alfred Magleby, the U.S. consul general based on the southern island of Okinawa. Her arrival also coincides with a visit by former president Bill Clinton, who is in the country to deliver a keynote speech at the JFK International Symposium held at Waseda University in Tokyo. During the five-day trip, Mrs Obama will also visit Cambodia - whose leader, Hun Sen, has a reputation for ruthlessness, and where child prostitution and human trafficking is rife - to highlight a campaign supporting education for girls. There were so far no details on the cost of the trip but the First Lady's group spent $222,000 over two days in hotel expenses during her 2014 trip to China, the Washington Examiner reported. Mrs Obama, who is visiting Japan for the first time, will have separate meetings with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. She will visit historic sites in the ancient capital, Kyoto, before travelling to Cambodia. In Tokyo she plans to announce, along with Japanese first lady Akie Abe, the Let Girls Learn initiative, a partnership supporting girls' education. The two will also meet with Japanese university students. It is hoped that the community-based aid program, led by the Peace Corps and similar aid organizations, will help get 62 million girls back into school. White House staff said that the program also reflects a U.S. commitment to be more involved in the Asia-Pacific region. Mrs Obama leaves the plane and heads for her motorcade in Tokyo where she will meet with Japanese first lady Akie Abe to discuss her education initiative . Mrs Obama will be the first sitting U.S. first lady to visit Cambodia, one of 11 countries participating in the Let Girls Learn initiative. Cambodia's government is led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has a reputation for ruthlessness and little tolerance for dissent. The country also has child prostitution and human trafficking problems. Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters that while in Cambodia, Mrs Obama plans to discuss the need for open and inclusive politics and highlight basic values and principles that are important to the U.S. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Mrs. Obama called it a 'tragic waste of human potential' when 62 million girls worldwide are not in school. 'It is also a serious public-health challenge, a drag on national economies and global prosperity, and a threat to the security of countries around the world, including our own,' Mrs. Obama wrote in her online travel journal. 'This visit is part of a journey that began decades ago, back when I was a little girl.' YouTube celebrity Michelle Phan is joining Mrs. Obama in Tokyo to help spread awareness for the Let Girls Learn campaign, and pose questions to the first lady submitted through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Speech: Former US President Bill Clinton delivers a keynote speech at the JFK International Symposium held at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.

All article text:Keith Thurman and Robert Guerrero gave a prime-time television audience something to watch Saturday night. Thurman won a piece of the welterweight title with a bruising decision win over Guerrero in the debut of a new boxing series on network television. And he did it with the kind of fight that had the crowd on its feet and gave a much needed boost to boxing in the first prime-time fights on NBC in 30 years. 'That's kind of performance that wins the hearts of fans even when you don't win the fight,' Guerrero said. 'The fans love that and that's what boxing is all about.' Keith Thurman (left) lands a left jab on Robert Guerrero during their WBA welterweight title bout . The fight was the highlight of a card that also included a win by Adrien Broner over John Molina in a super lightweight bout. But while fans booed that fight for lack of action, they cheered from the opening bell as Thurman took apart Guerrero in a fight that had a little bit of something for every fan - except a knockout. 'I know I was hurting him each and every round,' Thurman said. 'But he's a veteran and knew how to pace himself and stay a little out of my range.' Thurman knocked Guerrero down in the ninth round and won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown. But Guerrero fought hard and wasn't afraid to trade punches even while bleeding from a cut over his left eye late in the bout. A bloodied Guerrero rises to his feet after he was knocked down by Thurman in the ninth round . Thurman is sent to the neutral corner by referee Kenny Bayless as Guerrero recovers on the canvas . Thurman landed 211 of 598 punches to 104 of 497 for Guerrero, but that didn't tell the whole story. Thurman's punches were much harder and seemed to shake Guerrero on several occasions, though they didn't deter him from pressing the fight even after being knocked down and nearly knocked out in the ninth round. 'I keep fighting my heart out and that's what the fans like about me,' Guerrero said . Thurman won every round on one ringside scorecard and 10 rounds on the other two, using thudding punches to keep Guerrero away. Still, he was never able to put him away and Guerrero came back in the 10th round to land some big punches of his own while Thurman was on the ropes. 'Robert Guerrero was a tremendous warrior,' Thurman said. 'He was there the whole way.' Thurman won easily on all three ringside scorecards to capture the WBA version of the 147-pound crown . It was a signature win for Thurman, and not only because he was showcased on the top of the television card. He beat a fighter who fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2012, lasting all 12 rounds though dropping a lopsided decision. And he remained unbeaten in 25 fights with a performance that could put him in a big pay-per-view fight his next time out. The fight was the first of 20 cards scheduled this year for the Premier Boxing Champions series put together by manager Al Haymon and featuring his fighters. It was also the first of five scheduled Saturday prime-time bouts on NBC. And while it was created for television with an all-star cast of announcers that included Al Michaels, Marv Albert and Laila Ali, it also gave the crowd of 10,106 at the MGM Grand something different, too. Adrien Broner (right) hits John Molina with a right jab during their super lightweight bout in Las Vegas . Boxers were introduced on a stage at one end of the arena, and there were new high definition monitors above the ring to show the action. Unlike most boxing events, the fights also went off on time to accommodate television. In the first fight, Broner boxed his way to an easy win over Molina, using his left jab to pile up points. Despite winning every round on two of the three scorecards, though, Broner was booed by many in the crowd at the MGM Grand for not trying for a knockout in the super lightweight bout. Broner, trying to re-establish himself after a loss in 2012 to Marcos Maidana, used his superior speed to keep Molina off balance, rarely allowing him to land more than a single punch at a time. The former three-time champion was so far ahead in the final round that he did little but dance away from Molina, finally raising his hands in triumph with 10 seconds still left in the fight. Broner celebrates his victory after finishing his fight with a scorecard of 120-108, 120-108 and 118-110 . 'I know I lived up to the hype,' Broner said. 'He was swinging for the fences and I stayed dangerous. I felt like I beat all odds tonight.' Ringside punch stats reflected both Broner's dominance and the ineffectiveness of Molina's attack. Broner threw twice as many punches (502-249), and landed four times as many (219-54) in winning a decision that was never in doubt after the early rounds. Broner said he was not concerned about the boos, something commonplace early in his career. 'I knew walking into the arena 85 percent of the fans were against me,' he said. 'But I know I made some new fans around the world.' Broner, who improved to 30-1, was paid $1.2 million (£800,000), while Molina (27-6) earned $450,000 (£300,000).

The Blues carry a 1-1 first-leg score into the game at Stamford Bridge after Courtois pulled off a succession of impressive saves at the Parc des Princes, which included denying the Sweden striker with a late stop. The 22-year-old remains confident of keeping out the former Juventus and Barcelona forward again as Jose Mourinho's in-form side chase a treble in the manager's second spell in west London. Thibaut Courtois is confident that Chelsea will get past PSG to reach the Champions League quarter-finals . Jose Mourinho (left) congratulates Courtois after keeping Chelsea in the game in the first leg . The Blues No 1 is not afraid of facing PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Stamford Bridge . Speaking to RMC, the Belgium international said: 'No, I'm not afraid. 'I played against him three weeks ago, and I played well. I hope to stop him again on Wednesday. I know he's a great striker, and that it's always difficult to stop him, but we have to do that if we want to go through.' 'We're confident, but we expect a very difficult game. Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place. What is certain is that we cannot sit back and wait. 'We have to defend well, but we mustn't go for the 0-0 because if we concede a goal, Paris will qualify by winning 1-0. We have to play to our strengths by trying to score goals and win the game.' Chelsea team-mates congratulate Courtois after another impressive performance against West Ham . Ibrahimovic scores from the penalty spot in PSG's 4-1 victory over Lens at the weekend . Courtois added: 'As we're playing at home and we drew 1-1 in the first leg, we're slight favourites. But with the team that Paris has, they also have a lot of hope. It's going to be a very close match. The small details will decide who goes through.' The Premier League leaders required a late goal by Demba Ba to eliminate the big spending French side at the quarter-final stage last season, but are arguably a better team this term. Nonetheless, Courtois is fully aware of the threat posed by the expensively assembled Ligue 1 champions. A late Demba Ba goal eliminated the French side at the Champions League quarter-final stage last season . Ibrahimovic will be playing on the same side as former Chelsea defender David Luiz (right) this time around . 'They're a team that can reach the final. To play them in the last 16 is very early in the competition. But that's the way it is,' he said. 'It's going to be a hotly contested game. Paris are a strong team. We're going to have to be very careful because we mustn't lose. 'If you play for a team like Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich or PSG, the aim is always to win the Champions League. After that, it depends on the circumstances, the opponents you are drawn against. The aim is to win, but you have to see if it's possible. 'We're one of the teams that could win, but there are three or four others like us.'

A surveillance camera caught the near-fatal incident happening at Pudge Brothers Pizza in Aurora, Colorado, around 5pm on Wednesday. Footage shows the unidentified 15-year-old being driven through the front of the restaurant as a vehicle rams her from behind. She is suddenly showered with shards of glass as the window breaks before her. Furniture from  the eatery is upturned and pushed forwards. Miraculously the girl appears to be okay as she gets up from the bonnet and walks away. A passer-by stops at the front door to check out the situation. The sedan then appears to start backing up. Police told CBS News that the driver accidentally took her foot off the break, which caused her to speed forwards out of control. Her  15-year-old son, who was sat in the passenger seat, suffered a bloody nose and was taken to hospital.

All article text:(CNN)Life on a Civil War ship in the Deep South was no pleasure cruise. Heat, humidity, the rigors of military life and bouts of boredom could frustrate a fella. So it may be no surprise that among the first artifacts to be brought up from the wreck of the CSS Georgia in Savannah are two sets of leg irons. "We all know about discipline in the Navy," said Jim Jobling, a project manager with Texas A&M University's Conservation Research Laboratory.  "It is for restricting the mobility of a prisoner who wanted to desert or had committed a crime." Of course, the leg irons could have been used on a Federal sailor or soldier taken captive. But that didn't occur with the Confederate ironclad. It was scuttled in December 1864, having never fired a shot in anger while it defended the city. About 400 artifacts have been brought up by divers in the initial stage of the recovery of the CSS Georgia, which must be moved for a deepening of the shipping channel. "We have scratched the surface as far as the artifacts are concerned. There are a lot more to come up," Jobling told CNN on Thursday. Texas A&M is working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Savannah to conserve many of the artifacts for eventual display. Archaeology isn't just about cool artifacts. It's about making a connection with the humans that used these items. And while experts haven't gleaned much about the daily life of the crew from the early dives, they have found some items that would have been used by an individual: An ironstone plate commonly used in the South, a musket trigger guard and the butt stock of a gun. Visibility at the site is practically nonexistent. Divers have to depend on feel to locate and remove smaller items. Much of it is is detritus of the wreck: small iron plates, nails and spikes. Among the items cataloged since the dives formally began at the end of January are two pieces that helped with the business end of the CSS Georgia: its cannons. Four of the artillery pieces are amid the wreckage about 40 feet down on the floor of the Savannah River. One iron piece had eyes, or holes, that connected a gun carriage to ropes that the ironclad's crew manipulated to move the gun forward and backward. Another piece, a trunnion cap, helped hold the cannon to the carriage. Divers and archaeologists are following a timetable and grid in the recovery, with smaller items being brought up by hand. A previous salvage effort and damage from dredging displaced some of the artifacts. Other items remain right where they fell. "Someone undid the engine, moved it and was dropped" into the depths, said Jobling. Contract divers are out on the site every day, weather permitting, not more than a couple miles east of the city's famous River Street and waterfront. The $15 million removal of the CSS Georgia is necessary for the state and federal harbor deepening project, which will see the channel go from 42 to a uniform 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide. In June or July, U.S. Navy divers are expected be on site, to bring up the larger pieces: two engines, the propeller, a steam condenser, the four guns and the casemates that housed them. One of the casemates is large: 68 feet by 24 feet. Four artillery shells will be recovered, with the U.S. Marine Corps to render them safe for museum display. The wooden lower hull no longer exists. The CSS Georgia didn't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the Atlantic Ocean. Instead, the vessel became a stationary floating battery, bristling with artillery pieces. The Yankees refused to take on the CSS Georgia or other nearby defense obstructions. Archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the CSS Georgia through chemical and other means, making her iron stable so  the remains one day can be displayed. Conservation of selected artifacts and parts will be done at Texas A&M and will take about two years to complete. State and local officials hope conserved pieces will be exhibited somewhere in the city. Much of the CSS Georgia is corroded, and archaeologists are gauging the integrity of each piece for conservation. But many pieces remain in pretty good shape. An X-ray of one of the leg irons shows a fair bit of corrosion. Experts will inject epoxy to fill those gaps and remove any concretion on the iron, said Jobling. Officials need more artifacts and investigation to tell the story of the crew. "Hopefully, there is a section of the wreck that will tell the human side of the CSS Georgia," said Jobling. While salvage operations soon after the Civil War removed a lot of iron from the site, there's a chance personal items survive, especially if  they are below the sediment line and protected from the ravages of oxygen. Interestingly, the vessel's crew had to run the main engine constantly, just to keep it afloat. Why? That's because the CSS Georgia's green wood made it susceptible to leaks. So on December 21, 1864, just as Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's hordes of soldiers reached Savannah, the ironclad's crew likely opened its water valves. The CSS Georgia silently slipped below the surface. The sailors used small boats to get to shore and began a 20-mile walk from Savannah. "They took what they could carry with them," Jobling said.

All article text:One of the first victims to receive an NHS payout after being sexually assaulted by Jimmy Savile has spoken out against the ‘derisory and insulting’ amount he received. Steve Ashton, 50, was awarded just £3,125 after a two-year legal battle. Mr Ashton, who was repeatedly abused by the late DJ from the age of ten, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I would have got more for whiplash. 'It makes you wonder how many more of Savile’s victims have been fobbed off with such a derisory amount.’ Victim: Steve Ashton (left) who was abused by Jimmy Savile when he was 10,  was awarded £3,125 after a two-year legal battle . Mr Ashton said his case was not about the money, but he felt the figure was a snub to all victims. ‘What is this going to show to other people in this situation?’ he asked. ‘Do they want to go through years of absolute hell for such an amount? Hundreds of people who have yet to come forward will think, “I’m not having my life made into an open book for such a small amount.” It’s a disgrace. ‘No money can make up for Savile’s effect on my life. But there should be some recognition from the authorities of the damage done.’ Mr Ashton added that his payout, which had been contested by the NHS Charitable Trust, ‘is probably one day’s work for the law firm that represented me’. He added: ‘You hear of celebrities receiving £50,000 after having their phones hacked, but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten-year-old boy again and again? ‘I’ve been going through this for 40 years and I still feel Savile laughing at me.’ Mr Ashton’s award was calculated using a compensation ‘tariff’, which sets payouts at between £1,500 for indecent assault over clothing to £40,000 for rape. Victims are entitled to more if they can prove lasting psychiatric damage or repeated abuse. The compensation scheme, set up jointly by Savile’s estate, the BBC, the NHS, children’s charity Barnardos and lawyers acting for the victims, was finally approved by the Court of Appeal three months ago. Payments capped at £60,000 have been awarded to more than 200 people who applied. Each claim triggers payments of up to £16,000 to lawyers. ‘My law firm was very caring, but they will come out of this far wealthier and happier than I did,’ Mr Ashton said. He added that he was advised he might be able to secure more by continuing his fight in the High Court, but decided not to as success was not guaranteed. Savile befriended Mr Ashton at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where the victim’s mother Pamela worked as a spinal injuries researcher. The abuse happened in the Porter’s Lodge and in Savile’s private room at the hospital. Mr Ashton recalled: ‘He used to say, “This is our secret.” ‘If everywhere was busy he would take me to the mortuary. He once pointed at the fridges and said, “If you’re a naughty boy for Jimmy, this is where you’ll end up”.’

Authorites said on Monday that Blum, together with an unnamed companion, had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. ‘when a structural collapse of the rock occurred’ at Point Reyes National Seashore. After emergency personnel reached Blum and her companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead. Nancy Blum, 58, of San Francisco died on Saturday after falling 70 foot to her death when the Arch Rock at Point Reyes National Seashore collapsed into the sea . Authorites said on Monday that Blum, together with an unnamed companion, had been hiking about 6:30 p.m.  on Saturday ‘when a structural collapse of the rock occurred’ at Point Reyes National Seashore . The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death, reports SFGate. 'The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,' the sheriff's office said in a statement. Blum’s hiking companion continues to be treated for life-threatening injuries. The two visitors were standing on the Arch Rock lookout point when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet, winding up covered with rocks and debris. The National Park Service had posted signs at the site on Thursday warning hikers that a fissure along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened the cliff and that walking along the edge was potentially dangerous. The park did not close the trail and in spite of the warnings, one hiker who visited the park  told the San Francisco Chronicle that she had seen dozens of people walking in the area. A Sonoma County Sheriff officer pilots his helicopter near the collapsed section of the Arch Rock overlook at the Point Reyes National Seashore, about 40 miles northwest of San Francisco . Bluffs along the California coast are known for being unstable, according to the park service. The Arch Rock trail that runs along that part of the coast has been closed until further notice . This bluff along a hiking trail in Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County crumbled away on Saturday evening. One hiker fell 70 feet to their death while another had to be airlifted to the hospital . 'It was clear no one should be on that rock with the huge fissure,' Karen Blasing said. 'We stayed back, but many others were unconcerned and dangerously taking chances.' KBCW reports  that other park-goers scrambled to assist Blum and her companion before officials from Marin County fire, sheriff, and Park Rangers arrived. A Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office carried the pair to the trailhead, where a medical chopper was waiting. Bluffs along the California coast are known for being unstable, according to the park service.

All article text:Gareth Bale rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from Real Madrid supporters back down their throats with a first-half double and the perfect goal celebration. The former Tottenham forward, who scored 22 goals in 44 games in his first season at the club - including strikes that won the Copa del Rey and Champions League final - has had to put up with whistles in his own stadium and a fan poll that had 40 per cent of supporters calling for him to be dropped in recent weeks. When he put Real Madrid ahead on 18 minutes in the 2-0 win over Levante on Sunday night he made sure he left off some steam, covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick. Gareth Bale celebrates, with obvious relief, after breaking a long scoring drought to put Real Madrid ahead at the Bernabeu . The Welsh winger covers both his ears to demonstrate that he has not been listening to the boos from the Real Madrid fans . Bale ran to the corner flag and kicked it as he let out some pent-up frustration having found the net for the first time since January . Real Madrid's two expensive superstars both celebrate after Bale had diverted Ronaldo's shot into the corner of the net to make it 2-0 . Real Madrid (4-3-3): Navas; Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Modric (Illarramendi 78mins), Silva, Isco (Jese 69); Bale, Benzema (Hernandez 82), Ronaldo. Subs not used: Casillas, Nacho, Varane, Kroos. Goals: Bale 18, 40 . Booked: Modric . Levante (4-2-3-1): Marino; Lopez, Navarro, Ramis, Tono; Camarasa, Simao; Xumetra (Garcia 59), Barral, Morales (El Zhar 59); Uche (Casadesus 75). Subs not used: Fernandez, Juanfran, Mari, Sissoko. It was his first goal in nine games but with 16 in 38 this season he remains on course to match last year's haul and the singling out from those jeering supporters and some Madrid-based media had clearly got to him. The only player who did not seem to share his joy was Cristiano Ronaldo. It was his failed bicycle kick that was cleared off the line and came back out for Bale to volley into the top corner. Ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air at his missed effort both before and after Bale had buried the rebound. It was hardly the action of a man playing solely for his team. The Welshman scored again five minutes before the break, diverting a Ronaldo shot past Diego Marino. Ronaldo's effort looked as if it was going wide and although Bale's touch was slight it was necessary and he was awarded the goal. Bale's first half performance will have silenced those calls for him to be left out of the Real Madrid team. The jeers that have followed him around the pitch in recent weeks could even be heard when his name was read out before this win - although those for rested goalkeeper Iker Casillas and coach Carlo Ancelotti were more noticeable. Bale almost scored inside two minutes, taking a long ball forward down on his chest and volleying it across the face of goal. He looked motivated and buoyed by the return of Luka Modric in midfield - making his first start for over three months. Bale has come in for plenty of criticism from the La Liga crowd in recent weeks, but looked to have found his form at the right time . Karim Benzema tracks Levante's David Navarro as Real Madrid sought to respond after a poor performance against Schalke . Ronaldo cannot mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put Real ahead against Levante . The World Player of the Year endured a difficult first half, with his temper bubbling below the surface despite Real Madrid taking control . It was a Modric shot that Marino pushed out to the edge of the six-yard box that Karim Benzema turned in moments later but all three Real Madrid forwards - Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo - were offside. Modric then took a corner won by Bale and planted it on the Welshman's head only for the effort to go just wide. Bale was everywhere in the first 45 minutes, even popping up on the left and drilling the perfect cross to the edge of the six-yard box where Ronaldo somehow managed to fail to get enough on the centre and sent it wide. Real Madrid had former Levante keeper Keylor Navas playing against his old team. Casillas will return for next week's visit to the Camp Nou. The stand-in keeper was a spectator for the most part as Real Madrid dominated and Benzema could have made it three in spectacular fashion after the break. He flicked the ball onto the crossbar with a volley from a Ronaldo cross from the right and then caught the rebound again on the volley only to send it tamely wide. Ronaldo also shot straight at Marino five minutes from time and skied an effort from the edge of the six-yard box in injury time. It wasn't his night but it had been Madrid's. They moved to within a point of Barcelona with the victory. It brings to an end a run of two defeats and a draw and sets them, and Bale, up perfectly for next week's potentially season-deciding Clasico. VIDEO Bale was more motivated - Ancelotti .

All article text:Delhi (CNN)A court in New Delhi Wednesday summoned India's former Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, as a suspect in a trial over alleged irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks, a spokeswoman for the investigating agency told CNN. Singh and his former government have repeatedly denied accusations they cost the treasury billions of dollars in lost revenue by selling coalfields to private companies, without allowing competitive bidding. The 82-year-old leader, who served as the nation's prime minister for two successive terms until last year, was not named as a defendant in the original dossier of charges, said Kanchan Prasad, the spokeswoman for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Nevertheless, the trial court summoned him and some other corporate leaders to testify in person on April 8, she said. The case Singh has been asked to appear for relates to the licensing of a coal block to a private firm some 10 years ago, when he was also guardian of the nation's coal ministry. The summons has been issued under India's anti-corruption law. Singh said he was open to legal scrutiny. "(I) Am sure that the truth will prevail and I will get a chance to put forward my case with all the facts. I have always said I am open for legal scrutiny. Of course I am upset,  but this is part of life," he said in a text message issued by his office. Singh's Congress Party also came to his defense. The former prime minister functioned with "utmost probity and utmost transparency" during his term, said senior Congress Party leader Manish Tiwari. He said Singh's legal team would thoroughly examine the summons, and indicated it may be challenged in a higher court. The Oxford-Cambridge educated Singh has been credited with ushering in economic reforms in India as its finance minister in the 1990s. In his first term as prime minister, he initiated a historic nuclear deal with the United States that ended the South Asian nation's decades-old isolation in the global nuclear market. His second tenure was hit by the unearthing of a series of scandals spread across various sectors. In 2012, the national auditor alleged a widespread scam in the allocation of coal blocks. India depends heavily on coal for power. The fuel is abundantly available in the country, but that's still not enough to satisfy the demand for energy in Asia's third-largest economy. For the current financial year, national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes, according to official figures. Of it, at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal told the Indian parliament in December. The state-run monopoly Coal India Limited (CIL) accounts for more than 80% of the output. Plans by current Prime Minister Narendra Modi for future privatization of the industry faced resistance recently, when CIL workers stopped work in January. The two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas, but forced the government to go slow on reforms.

All article text:Australia captain Michael Clarke bids farewell to one-day international cricket on Sunday — to save himself for one more shot at humiliating England. The 33-year-old has decided to retire from the 50-over game after steering his country to the World Cup final, with the sole intention of leading the Aussies into this summer’s Ashes showdown in England. ‘A priority for me is to continue to be successful in the Test format,’ said Clarke. ‘I think by walking away from one-day cricket it probably gives me my best opportunity.’ Michael Clarke shakes hands with New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum ahead of Sunday's final . And that spells danger for England with Clarke hungrier than ever to finally win an away Ashes series, having lost on all three of his previous trips. Clarke scored two centuries guiding Australia to their 5-0 whitewash of Alastair Cook’s dismal team last winter, but he’s desperate to break his duck in England in what will almost certainly be his last Ashes away tour. ‘I’ve never hid behind the fact that I find Test cricket to be the pinnacle of our sport,’ said Clarke, who has won 108 Test caps including 30 against England. The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference on Saturday morning . ‘I’ve never gone down that road anyway in regard to what is the best thing to do for the public interest, as I’m sure you would have seen through my career, I’ve copped my fair share of smacks in the mouth. ‘But I am whoI am and it’s about being true to myself and I don’t feel bad about saying I believe Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. I love that challenge, I find it extremely difficult every Test match I play. I do see it as the pinnacle. I still think I’ve got a lot to offer the team as captain of the Australian Test team, and I want to make sure I continue to have success in that format.’ Clarke was made captain in all formats when Ricky Ponting stood down following the 2011 World Cup. He will be making his 245th one-day appearance for Australia and his 75th as skipper on Sunday as Australia take on New Zealand, led by Brendon McCullum (inset). George Bailey and Steve Smith are thought to be the two men most likely to succeed Clarke in captaining the Aussies. Clarke made his ODI debut 12 years ago and has scored almost 8,000 runs for his country . Clarke, who will continue to play at Test level, is pictured playing a shit in the nets ahead of Sunday's match . Clarke, pictured with team-mate Shane Watson, will lead Australia against England in the Ashes later this year . Clarke has been suffering with a back problem for some time and a hamstring injury ruled him out of Australia’s World Cup build up with George Bailey and Steve Smith, the two men most likely to succeed him, both leading the side. ‘I don’t think it is realistic that I’ll be fit and healthy and available to play the next World Cup so I believe it is the right time,’ he said. ‘I think I’ll leave the one-day game for the Australian team in a better place than when I took over the captaincy.’

All article text:Dressed in jumpsuits, hands in cuffs, or locked away in tiny cells, these are the youths held by America's juvenile justice system. The emotional portraits, taken at three 'school' facilities around Washington state, show the inmates standing in prison corridors and resting in their rooms - as well as others which simply try to show how they are feeling. All of the subjects have been locked away after sentencing in the state's juvenile courts, and are part of a project by photographer Steve Davis. Incarcerated: The photo series shows inmates held in Washington state's juvenile prison system, such as the two men above . Grim: One inmate is pictured above in his room, which features a combination toilet-sink, which seemingly leaks . Bleak surroundings: Photographer Steve Davis visited three school-cum-prison facilities in the state, and photographed inmates and their surroundings . Cuffed: These two prisoners have their wrists and ankles bound in the uncompromising portrait above . However, while Davis, whose images are due to be published in an upcoming book, focused on the prisoners' human side for his series, he deliberately left out one aspect: their pasts. Each portrait has been left without a label identifying the prisoner, in an attempt to break the link between those depicted and their crimes. He also shows their bleak living conditions, from a stark gym to a deserted exercise yard, to uncomfortable-looking standard-issue single beds. Marketing material for Davis's book says the intention is that 'the viewer must draw conclusions about each person’s past and possible future... from the simultaneously vast and limited information in each photograph'. Davis, who took the photographs between 1997 and 2005, met the subjects through his work as a resident artist in three of Washington's detention centers, which double as schools. Obscure: Davis made the deliberate decision not to mention the crimes which led to the youths being locked away . No home comforts: The images show bare sleeping, social and exercise space inside the prison system . Prison system: State officials say the juvenile detention centers are a last resort for dangerous youths or those who have no responded to other measures . Around 750 youths a year are sent to juvenile detention facilities in Washington. State information on the system says those sent there have often committed violent crimes or ignored previous punishments. Information from the overseeing Social and Health Services department says: 'These youngsters are typically serious and violent offenders or youth with extensive offense histories who have not responded to local sanctions and interventions.' Children as young as 12 can be incarcerated, and can stay in the facilities until they are 20. More than 90 per cent are male. According to data from September 2014, around two thirds are aged 16-18. Some 19 per cent are sex offenders, while 54 per cent have been convicted of violent crimes. Robbery, assault, burglary and rape feature prominently among the convictions which led to their incarcerations. Around half have mental health issues. Judgement? Davis intended his views to draw their own conclusions from the pictures . Grim dunk: This basketball hoop, surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, is an example of the bleak leisure facilities on offer .

All article text:A mother-of-three whose sex life was ruined after a negligent delay in spinal surgery has won £2.4million in damages from the NHS. Heather Tait was in tears yesterday when the award was announced at London’s High Court. The 34-year-old photographer had told an earlier hearing in Birmingham that her ‘passionate’ sex life with her husband Russel had been ruined by the complications she continues to suffer from. Heather Tait (left) was suffering from acute back pain when medics sent her home without carrying out an MRI scan . Judge Martin McKenna, who made the award, said Mrs Tait had told doctors that she ‘now feels that to a degree there is no point in having intercourse’. She also felt her closeness with her husband had been ‘jeopardised’ by her lack of enjoyment in sex. Mrs Tait, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, said as she left court: ‘I’m pleased that it is finally over.’ She was the boss of her own company and winning respect as a professional photographer before she went into Cheltenham General Hospital in July 2009, suffering from severe back pain. Judge McKenna – who only had to decide the amount of damages after a judgment was entered for Mrs Tait against the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust in 2012 – said although it was suspected she had a prolapsed disc, she was sent home without an MRI scan. By the next day, Mrs Tait’s condition had deteriorated. She returned to hospital and a scan revealed a massive prolapsed disc. She had emergency spinal surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham on July 8, 2009. The 34-year-old developed a devastating back condition after delays in emergency scans and treatment while being treated at Cheltenham General Hospital . The hospital's negligence left Mrs Tait 'doubly incontinent, with a loss of sexual sensation and some psychiatric damage,' London's High Court (pictured) heard . Judge McKenna said the trust had admitted if she had had the scan and surgery earlier, she would not have developed the severe injuries she now suffers from. Mrs Tait has been left doubly incontinent and ‘has suffered a loss of sexual sensation and some psychiatric damage’, the judge said. Cauda equina syndrome is a serious condition where the nerves at the very bottom of the spinal cord become compressed. Symptoms include: . Doctors advise seeking medical assistance immediately if a person develops these symptoms. They should visit their GP or the accident and emergency (A&E) department of the nearest hospital. If cauda equina syndrome is not promptly treated, the nerves to the bladder and bowel can become permanently damaged. Source: NHS Choices . She continues to suffer from back pain. As well as helping her husband to run a conferencing organising business – Crystal Clear Productions (CCP) – Mrs Tait ran her own photography business, Heather Tait Photography. Judge McKenna said she was not a person who would exaggerate her symptoms for profit. ‘She is a high achiever who has worked extremely hard throughout her life,’ he said. ‘She left school at 17 with ten GCSEs to pursue a career in theatre lighting and media, and she is, plainly, a capable, driven and ambitious woman with proven business skills, and a talented photographer who has been the driving force behind the success of CCP.’ He said that despite the effect of the delayed surgery, Mrs Tait had tried to continue her photographic business and complete the first year of a Masters degree at Birmingham City University. ‘To my mind these are not the character traits or indeed the actions of a malingerer or someone who is out to exaggerate her claim for financial gain,’ he said. Judge McKenna awarded Mrs Tait £140,000 for her pain and suffering and loss of amenity, with the balance made up of past and future care and loss of earnings. As well as paying £2.4million in damages, the trust must also pay legal costs estimated at £1.2million. The trust’s counsel, Robert Seabrook QC, said ‘continuous efforts’ were made to improve procedures and standards at its hospitals. He also expressed the trust’s ‘deep sympathy’ to Mrs Tait for the ‘terrible injuries she has suffered’. Mrs Tait said as she left court: 'I'm pleased that it is finally over.'

All article text:A JetBlue Airways pilot who had to be restrained during a 2012 flight after shouting about Jesus and al-Qaeda  sued for more than $16 million Friday, claiming the airline failed to recognize and address his mental condition. The suit filed by former captain Clayton Osbon three years after his meltdown on a flight from New York to Las Vegas, comes amid increased scrutiny of how major airlines evaluate pilots' mental health in the wake of the allegedly intentional crash of a Germanwings . Osbon, 52, claims in the lawsuit that officials at JetBlue missed several indications that something was wrong with his mental health the day of the flight, noting he missed a pre-flight meeting for the first time in years and arrived to fly disheveled and disoriented. Scroll down for video . Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleges the airline routinely ignored crew members' impairment, whether by alcohol, drugs or mental and emotional distress, in order to protect their careers. Hospitalized: Osbon, right, is led out by FBI agents after being released from Northwest Texas hospital in Amarillo following his mid-air breakdown . Veteran captain: Osbon, left, was an experienced pilot but a 'complex partial brain seizure' impaired his brain functions and caused him to hallucinate, according to the lawsuit . Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity. Among other conditions of his sentence, Osbon was ordered not to board a commercial or private plane without permission from a probation officer. Osbon remains suspended on medical leave, no longer collecting what once was a more than $300,000 annual salary. The lawsuit states he has not suffered a seizure since beginning a regimen of prescription medication.
