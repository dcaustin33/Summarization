All article text:(CNN)On Friday, ISIS claimed responsibility for Yemen's deadliest terror attack. A day earlier it claimed responsibility for the worst terror attack in Tunisia. Last week it welcomed into the fold Boko Haram, a Nigerian terrorist group with thousands of fanatical fighters that dominates territory the size of New Jersey. All this came in the wake of the group's rapid expansion across Libya, its assimilation of a powerful Egyptian terrorist group, and the founding of small chapters in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Algeria, where its new affiliate last year beheaded a French hiker. The group's momentum may have stalled in Syria and Iraq, but its supporters from the Atlantic to the Hindu Kush appear to be heeding its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's call to "erupt volcanoes of jihad." By far the most surprising development was its claim of responsibility for the twin suicide bomb blasts that killed over 130 in Houthi-Shia mosques in Sanaa, Yemen, on Friday and another attack in the north. ISIS was only thought to have a fledgling presence in Yemen and had only claimed one previous attack, the assassination of a Yemeni security official north of Aden earlier this month. Al Qaeda in Yemen, or AQAP, has for years been the dominant Jihadi group inside Yemen, but it denied involvement in the mosque attacks, saying it was against its principles to target mosques, bolstering the ISIS claim. This indicates ISIS has very quickly built up an operational capability inside Yemen in the months since jihadis inside the country released an audiotape declaring allegiance to Baghdadi last November. Only two developments could explain this: defections from AQAP or the return home of Yemeni ISIS veterans skilled in urban warfare and explosives. There is no love lost these days between the two groups. Since Baghdadi declared ISIS had expanded into Yemen late last year there has been an escalating war of words between them, with ISIS claiming AQAP was not doing enough to target Houthis and AQAP declaring that the ISIS caliphate was illegitimate. While AQAP has acknowledged previous internal disagreements about whether to support ISIS, there have been relatively few defections. Its charismatic leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, al Qaeda's global number two, is extremely popular among the group's rank and file. In recent months the group has reaped a recruitment windfall from Sunni tribal anger over the Houthi takeover of Sanaa, allowing it to expand its operations across Yemen. But ISIS appears now to have laid down the gauntlet, declaring its attacks Friday were the "tip of the iceberg." In targeting the Houthi mosques in Sanaa, ISIS would be quite deliberately repeating the sectarian strategy of its founder, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who launched a devastating suicide bombing on Golden Mosque in Samarra in February 2006, which plunged Iraq into a full-blown sectarian civil war. Al-Zarqawi correctly calculated that the Shia, infuriated by the attack on their most sacred shrines, would violently retaliate, driving Sunnis into the embrace of the jihadis.  Yemen appears now to be on the brink of a similar civil war. The terrorist attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunisia on Wednesday that killed 23 was the worst terrorist attack on tourists in the Arab world since the 1997 massacre in Luxor, Egypt. It would also be ISIS' most spectacular act of international terrorism since it carried out coordinated suicide bombings on American and international hotels in Amman, Jordan, in 2005. But Tunisia is right on Europe's doorstep, just 30 miles across the sea from the southern Italian island of Pantelleria. ISIS has so far offered no proof to back up its claim it was responsible. Yet several factors give the claim credence. Firstly, as of late Friday no other group had claimed responsibility. Secondly, Tunisian investigators have established that two members of the cell that carried out the attack trained in the Derna and Benghazi region of Libya late last year. In November, CNN reported that ISIS was running several training camps in the Green Mountains between these two eastern Libyan towns where it was instructing recruits from across North Africa, including Tunisians. Thirdly, up to 3,000 Tunisians have traveled to Syria and Iraq, many to fight with ISIS. Five-hundred are believed to have returned home, including a significant number of trained killers, skilled in handling automatic weapons. The three most powerful new ISIS affiliates are in Egypt, Libya and Nigeria. Last November the Egyptian Sinai-based jihadi group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to ISIS. Bolstered by the return home from Syria of Egyptian ISIS veterans, in recent months the group has escalated its campaign of attacks against security forces in the Sinai and across Egypt and has put out its own gory beheading videos. The threat it poses to Western tourists was underlined last summer when it killed an American oil worker in the deserts southwest of Cairo in a carjacking. In Libya, ISIS is taking advantage of chaos and simmering civil war to rapidly expand. Last autumn it established a foothold in eastern Libya, bolstered by the return of 300 Libyan ISIS veterans and the arrival of a top deputy of al-Baghdadi. It is now the dominant force in Derna, has a presence in Benghazi and controls part of the town center in Sirte, on whose beaches it beheaded more than a dozen Egyptian Christians in February. It also has a growing presence in Tripoli, where its fighters in January carried out an attack on the five-star Corinthia hotel that killed several Westerners. In Nigeria, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to ISIS earlier this month and brought celebrations to the streets of Raqqa, ISIS' headquarters town in Syria. Boko Haram hopes it will bring a recruitment, fundraising and propaganda windfall. "The merger with the Islamic State was a strategic, calculated, and long-term decision coming from the top of the Boko Haram leadership and communications structure," wrote Jacob Zenn, an expert on the group, in a just released West Point Combating Terrorism Center study on ISIS' growing array of affiliates. Though military operations by Nigeria and Chad have eroded Boko Haram's safe haven in northeastern Nigeria in recent weeks, the group still has formidable capacity to terrorize the region. A signature tactic: beheading its enemies with chain saws. For reasons of geography, there appear to be fewer organizational ties between ISIS and Boko Haram than between ISIS and its affiliates in Libya and Egypt. "The numbers of Boko fighters who have fought or trained with ISIS in places such as Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Libya and returned to Nigeria is believed to be small: fewer than 20 fighters and video-propagandists," Zenn, who was recently briefed by Nigerian intelligence officials, told CNN. ISIS' expansion into the southern shore of the Mediterranean has alarmed European governments. Italian fishermen operating off the south coast of Italy are so concerned they could be targeted by ISIS gunmen launching from Libya in speedboats that they have demanded protection from the Italian navy. Then there is the threat of trained European fighters returning home from the killing fields of Iraq and Syria. Over 3,000 Europeans have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq, many with ISIS. More than 750 have returned. Among their number, according to Belgian counterterrorism officials, was a Belgian terrorist cell dispatched by ISIS from Syria to carry out a major terrorist attack in the heart of Europe. The plot was thwarted when several of the cell were killed in a gunbattle in eastern Belgium in January. European officials told CNN ISIS is increasingly pivoting toward plotting attacks in Europe. There is also concern ISIS could infiltrate non-European Union passport holders into Europe. Last year more than a hundred-thousand refugees arrived in Italy from Libya, according to the United Nations. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls warned Thursday that Europe faced the greatest terrorist threat in its history, the starkest warning yet from a head of a European government since ISIS set up its caliphate in Syria and Iraq. "The problem is not if there will be another attempted attack in France and in Europe, but to know when and where," he said.

All article text:As one of the UK’s most popular fast food chains, it sells almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. But now conditions on the farms that supply KFC with 23million chickens a year can be shown for the first time. The images show tens of thousands of chickens kept together in huge sheds, alive for just 35 days before they are gassed. Scroll down for video . Life on the farm: Supplier Andrew in the shed filled with 34,00 chickens destined for the fast food chain KFC . The thousands of chickens live together in huge sheds for just 35 days before they are gassed . A documentary tonight shows the birds living amid their excrement in conditions activists say are ‘oppressive’ – but the farmer in charge claims it’s ‘a very good life’. Footage to be screened this evening on BBC1 focuses on one farm where about 34,000 chickens are penned into a shed with few windows. When they are large enough the chickens are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to warehouses in large trays where they are then distributed to branches nationwide. The farmer in charge claimed the birds had 'a very good life' and showed how they were healthy . Farms supply KFC with around 23 million chickens each year and its chains sell almost 400 pieces of chicken every minute. At one farm around 34,000 chickens are penned into sheds with few windows . About 1,000 farms in the country supply KFC with 23million chickens a year. The programme focuses on a farmer called Andrew who says the chickens at his farm – left to do nothing but eat and drink until they reach the required weight – have a good life, saying he ‘wouldn’t mind being a chicken in here’. Scenes show the chickens as they walk around in their own excrement while a layer of sawdust has turned murky brown from mopping up waste. Asked if he thinks this is a problem, Andrew says: ‘No, no, no, that’s not a problem at all, because you see here, this is all sawdust, so the idea is to keep this as dry as possible.’ The supplier, who has 35 years’ experience, says: ‘As you can see, they’ve got beautifully clean feet and that is a good sign that these birds are healthy and they’ve been grown on good litter. You can see this is a good, healthy chicken. I can’t think there’s anything better than being sat in a chicken farm looking at chickens. You can see for yourself, they look absolutely fantastic.’ Asked whether he feels it is a shame their lives end so soon, he says: ‘No, they probably have a short life but they have a very good life.’ Yesterday animal rights campaigners claimed the lives of the KFC chickens were ‘oppressive’. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, said: ‘These birds have no meaningful life. They endure a wretched existence in giant windowless sheds stinking with ammonia. A very large number die from starvation or dehydration. About 900million of these birds are produced in country each year about 30million-plus die in the sheds. When the chickens are large enough they are gassed, chopped into nine pieces and sent to the warehouses in large trays . The trays of chicken are then distributed to KFC branches nationwide and sold to customers . This is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. The fast food chain say animal welfare is 'essential' Fast food: One of KFC's branches. KFC say that all their suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements . ‘Millions of these birds, just like the ones KFC is commissioning to be produced die in sheds wretchedly and painfully every year. ‘These birds are deprived of everything that makes life worth living. The next step after this is to be grabbed by their frail legs, and shoved in crates and taken off to slaughter. A great number suffer broken bones during this process.’ A BBC spokesman said the documentary offers ‘an impartial look at KFC, one of the UK’s most recognisable businesses’. It is the first time cameras have been allowed access to KFC. A KFC spokesman said: ‘Animal welfare is essential for high quality food and is important to our customers, and all of KFC’s suppliers meet or exceed UK and EU welfare requirements. KFC was the first quick-service restaurant to gain Red Tractor certification and we have in place our own robust standard, which is independently audited by third parties.’ Episode one of The Billion Dollar Chicken Shop airs on BBC1 at 9pm.

All article text:Lawrence Okoye is set for the next step  in his NFL career. Since swapping the discus for the defensive line, mentor Jim Tomsula said the 6ft 6in man mountain has  adapted to the sport well, but is set to face a steep learning curve in his third year with the San Francisco 49ers. 'The development has been significant. But he’s playing a position that’s not like anything else that he’s done. So everything is completely brand new and that’s a hard transition.' 'This year, he's going to be in there against guys that are going to make the other team. Let's see where we're at,' head coach Tomsula said at the NFL owners meeting. Lawrence Okoye faces a battle to make the 53-man roster and Jim Tomsula is keen to know where he stands . Jim Tomsula spoke about Lawrence Okoye's future and was gushing about Jarryd Hayne's NFL hopes . After signing as an undrafted free agent in 2013, Okoye's first year in the Bay Area was injury-hit. Last season he played against third and fourth-stringers in pre-season before being signed to the practice squad. Despite Tomsula's expertise as a defensive line coach, 23-year-old former Olympian Okoye faces a battle to make the 49ers final 53-man roster due to enormous depth at the position. Even without the likes of Justin Smith and Ray McDonald, Tomsula reckons it's the best positional group he's had in his eight years with the franchise. Tomsula also spoke of fellow NFL-convert Jarryd Hayne, who joined the 49ers from Australia's NRL as a free agent earlier this month. The 49ers plan to use Hayne as a running back but Tomsula would not rule out using him as a returner, and spoke of his excitement at working with the 27-year-old. 'He’s a guy used to being downfield catching a ball with people running at him,' Tomsula said. 'He’s used to making tackles in open spaces. You’ve got a guy used to carrying the ball, catching the ball and avoiding. Obviously, with the explosive qualities that he has, you can’t help but be excited.'

All article text:His face twisted in fury, Abase Hussen punches his fist into the air and launches into an Islamic war cry. ‘Burn, burn USA,’ he yells from his prime spot at the front of one of the most notorious rallies in recent times. Once the crowd is whipped into a fever, an American flag is set on fire and held aloft by a fanatic. Video footage shows Mr Hussen desperately trying to hold the burning flag as the chanting behind him intensifies. Scroll down for video . Abase Hussen (circled right), whose daughter fled the UK last month to join ISIS, was pictured at an Islamic protest alongside Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale (circled left) Adebowale, who killed Lee Rigby alongside Michael Adebolajo, turns to reveal his face at the notorious rally . Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . He manages to grab the flag briefly before being forced to drop it because of the power of the smoke and flames. As the remainder of the flag burns on the ground, Mr Hussen chants ‘Allahu Akbar’. He pushes the palm of his hand repeatedly toward the embers, rejoicing at the destruction of the stars and stripes. Mr Hussen – the father of one of the three schoolgirls who fled Britain to join Islamic State – then turns his attention to a burning Israeli flag on the floor and begins to chant and gesture toward it. He is one of a dozen fanatics standing behind a banner which proclaims: ‘The followers of Mohammed will conquer America.’ Behind him, hundreds of fanatics repeatedly chant incendiary slogans while holding menacing black jihadi flags. Among the rabble-rousers was notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who has led a number of Islamist groups that were subsequently banned. Alongside him stood Michael Adebowale, one of the two Muslim converts who murdered and almost beheaded Fusilier Lee Rigby in the name of Allah eight months later. Sinister: Also at the rally was Adebowale who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby the following year . Respectable: Abase Hussen, pictured far right, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee following his daughter's disappearance. The report was released this week . Abu Izzadeen, infamous for heckling former Home Secretary John Reid in 2006, also led some of the chanting. But last month Mr Hussen gave evidence to Parliament refusing to accept any responsibility for the three schoolgirls’ actions, instead seeking to blame the police, teachers, Turkish officials and others. In an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen, who was with the families of the other two girls, denied even knowing what Islamic radicalisation was. Cuddly: Hussen appealing for the return of his 'jihadi daughter' a few weeks ago after she ran off . ‘As for me, I don’t know the symptoms even — what radicalisation is,’ he told MPs. Mr Hussen also repeatedly blasted the Metropolitan Police for handing a letter to his daughter requesting parental permission to speak to the girls about a friend who had earlier travelled to Syria. He said police officers should have given it directly to the families. He said: ‘I strongly disagree with the letter being given to 15-year-old girls. The word “police” by itself and “terrorism” or “counter-terrorism”, as global issues – it is a heavy burden for a 15-year-old to deal with that. We also feel that we are neglected as parents. ‘We are supposed to know these things. We are the guardians. The letter destructs our daughter, destructs our family and terrorises our children. What we want to know is: apart from this letter, what was the verbal conversation with this child? I know my daughter. She is the kind of girl who, if it is sunset, she will call me to pick her up. ‘How on earth she travelled abroad to join ISIS, is a very difficult question for us to answer – even to predicate. The letter terrified my daughter.’ The families were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. Mr Akunjee, who has posted extremist views on his Facebook page, accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December. In a 45-minute grilling in front of the families, Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was forced to apologise for failing to communicate more directly with the families. Giving evidence to the committee, Mr Hussen claimed he did not know that his daughter Amira might have been exposed to radical views. Chairman Keith Vaz pressed him on this point, asking him: ‘Did it come to your attention in any way that they were involved in the kinds of things that it is alleged that they were involved in following this becoming public?’ Mr Hussen replied: ‘Not at all. Nothing.’ Chilling: A CCTV image of 15-year-old Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Shamima Begum, 15, at Gatwick Airport before they caught their flight to Turkey . Fanaticism: Footage of the controversial rally showed Mr Hussen chanting among the crowds of protesters. The demonstration, held in 2012, was led by firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Lee Rigby's killer . Extremist: The protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser Anjem Choudary, who made a speech saying that Sharia would take over the entire world, including America and the UK . Shocking: Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage (pictured) to see if any criminal offences had been committed . What the MPs were not told was that Mr Hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of demonstrations that took place across the world in September 2012. Thousands had taken to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, criticised for ridiculing Islam. In London, more than 150 clashed with police outside the US embassy. They included Luton radicals Abu Rahin Aziz, who is fighting for Islamic State, and Saiful Islam, who was the subject of a Channel 4 exposé called Proud and Prejudiced. Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Rahin Aziz has called for Theresa May to be executed, suggested that Islamic State-style executions take place in Trafalgar Square and threatened to blow up Big Ben. Last night members of the Commons committee expressed their shock and astonishment over Mr Hussen’s activities. Labour MP Ian Austin said: ‘It is extraordinary that this man blamed the police, the Government, the school, the Turkish government and everyone else for his daughter’s decision to go to Syria but failed to mention his own involvement in an appalling Islamist rally. Perhaps the committee should invite Mr Hussen back so he can explain what he was doing.’ Tory MP Michael Ellis, who also sits on the committee, said: ‘This will come as a surprise to those who heard criticism of the police and school. This raises serious questions about the potential negative influence on an impressionable young mind.’ Mr Vaz said: ‘It is clear that families and communities need to take greater responsibility for protecting young people who could be at risk of radicalisation. ‘Witnesses before the committee are responsible for their own statements. When Mr Hussen gave evidence, he said he had no idea that his daughter had been involved in radicalisation or had been radicalised.’ Amira fled with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, from their homes in east London to Syria last month. The trio were following in the footsteps of Sharmeena Begum, who left their school, Bethnal Green Academy in East London, to go to Syria in December. Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to see if any offences had been committed.

All article text:(CNN)A previously unknown group calling itself the Islamic State Hacking Division posted the names, photos and addresses of about 100 U.S. troops online, calling for attacks against them. Whoever created the file, posted online Saturday before being removed, claimed to have hacked military databases and said it was leaking 100 names "so that our brothers residing in America can deal with you." The possibility of lone-wolf attacks in the United States, the type that this message calls for, is a threat officials take seriously. Attorney General Eric Holder said last month that the threat of a lone-wolf attack inside the United States is one thing that keeps him awake at night. But there was nothing to immediately validate the claims made by this unknown group. A Defense Department official told CNN that it cannot confirm the validity of the online posting, but is looking into the claim. The FBI is also looking into it, a law enforcement official told CNN, adding there are questions about the credibility of those behind it. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service notified the Marines named in the file about this "presently unverified threat," a Marine Corps spokesman said. The Navy reminded service members to make sure to limit the amount of personal information available online about themselves. The Army said in a statement Sunday that it was working with the Defense Department to "determine the validity of any potential threats," and it echoed the Navy in advising soldiers "to take prudent measures to limit the sharing of personal information online." A U.S. law enforcement official said that all 100 or so troops named in the file are being contacted. It is believed that ISIS members and sympathizers have been scouring social media sites trying to glean as much information as possible about service members, and have even threatened the spouses of military personnel online. The file appeared to include information that is already available publicly, through social media accounts, online phone directories and other accessible public records. In late November, the FBI issued a warning to U.S. military members that ISIS was calling for attacks against them, a law enforcement source told CNN. The source said that "overseas based individuals are looking for like-minded individuals in the U.S. to carry out these attacks." The warning asked members of the military to "review their online social media presence for any information that might attract the attention of violent extremists." The bulletin also said authorities were concerned that ISIS members were "spotting and assessing" individuals in the United States who may be interested in carrying out attacks inside the country against members of the military, a U.S. counterterror official told CNN. CNN's Barbara Starr, Pamela Brown, Kevin Bohn and Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report.

All article text:The president of Sierra Leone has ordered the entire country to stay at home for three days in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola. Ernest Koroma has ordered the entire population into lock down from 6am on March 27 until 6pm on March 29. It comes as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - which have been the centres of the outbreak which has killed more than 10,000 people - have set a goal of cutting off the disease's spread by April 16. The president of Sierra Leone has ordered the entire country to stay at home for three days in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola . The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has claimed almost 3,700 lives in Sierra Leone, one of three impoverished west African nations that have seen their economies and healthcare systems wrecked by the crisis . Koroma said: 'All Sierra Leoneans must stay at home for three days,' he announced, expanding a previous order for a lockdown in the capital Freetown and northern areas of the country nationwide. 'I have made my personal commitment to do whatever it takes to get to zero Ebola infections and I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together,' he added. Liberia had previously reported that it had reached an end to the epidemic in the country but a new case appeared in its capital Monrovia on Friday. The infected woman is the wife of a man already cured of the disease, it has been reported. One of the deadliest viruses known to man, Ebola is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms, such as fever or vomiting. Health workers from Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society Burial Team carry an ebola victim from a house in Freetown . The World Health Organization said Ebola can still be transmitted in sperm 82 days after a patient carrying the virus is cured. The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has claimed almost 3,700 lives in Sierra Leone, one of three impoverished west African nations that have seen their economies and healthcare systems wrecked by the crisis. 'The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone,' President Koroma said.

Caleb Barnes, 20, is suspected of repeatedly stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck as she tried to fight him off while they were in a car parked in the driveway in front of her Upper Macungie home. It is believed the slaying happened after Silvonek told Barnes and the daughter she disapproved of their relationship. Scroll down for video . Caleb Barnes, 20, is suspected of killing the mother of his 14-year-old girlfriend by stabbing her in the neck . Cheryl Silvonek, 54, tried to fight him off while they were in a car at her home in Upper Macungie, Pennsylvania . When police arrived at the home (pictured) early on Sunday, they found Barnes and the girl in a bedroom . After Silvonek was dead, Barnes and the daughter, who was in the car during the killing, took the other family vehicle to Wamart and purchased alcohol, bleach and other cleaning products, the Allentown Morning Call reported. They attempted to clean up the car, drove it to nearby South Whitehall and buried Silvonek in a shallow grave. Police found the car submerged in a pond and traced it back to the Silvonek residence. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep,CBS 13 reported. Barnes, who has the rank of specialist, was charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. She has been charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. It has not been determined if she will be tried as an adult or a juvenile. Defense attorney John Waldron said: 'She's just crying for her mom, saying she misses her mom. 'This is a child, who just turned 14. She's in shock.' The girl's grandparents were in the courtroom during a hearing on Monday. Waldron said: 'Everyone was crying. It was just brutal.' Barnes and the girl started dating in October. He joined the military in February of 2012. He graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. David Silvonek said he was not aware of their relationship. Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said. 'The mother became aware of the relationship and was attempting to have her daughter break it off. 'Obviously we don't know what occurred in the driveway. There are different versions of the event.' The girl is in a juvenile facility that will provide her with psychological counseling. A friend of Barnes said he had personal problems, 69 News reported. The unidentified female friend said: 'Anytime he was around me, he was very sweet and polite, but one day he would be the nicest person you've ever met and the next day he would be dark and gloomy and depressed. 'He wanted to be loved so badly, he was made fun of a lot.'

All article text:No free speech: Ryan Pate was arrested in Abu Dhabi last month after complaining about his UAE employer on Facebook - a violation of the country's law against slandering an employer . A hallmark of American life - griping about work - has landed a Florida man in a Middle Eastern jail. Ryan Pate, a helicopter mechanic from Belleair Bluffs, Florida, took to Facebook after a dispute over sick leave with the company he was working for in the United Arab Emirates. He was home in Florida at the time, but when he returned to Abu Dhabi last month, he was told to report to the police station, where he was arrested for breaking an Emirates law on slandering his employer. He spent about 10 days in jail, he said, and is now free on bail awaiting a March 17 trial. His supporters say he faces up to five years in prison and a steep fine if convicted. 'I just couldn't register it in my head because as an American growing up in the United States, the First Amendment right is just ingrained in my brain,' he said in a phone interview Wednesday. 'I never even entertained the fact that I would wind up in prison out here for something I put on Facebook in the United States.' Pate, 30, said the incident stemmed from a trip to Florida in December. During his return he spent the holidays with family and proposed to his girlfriend, Jillian Cardoza, but also was trying to get treatment for a back injury. There was disagreement with his bosses about extending his leave to see a doctor, he said, and after a particularly unsatisfactory phone call with them, he took to a Facebook. He says he can't remember precisely what he wrote, but knows he called his bosses 'backstabbers' and warned other contractors not to work for them. He didn't give the rant much thought until he was back in the Persian Gulf, where he planned to handle paperwork to end his employment as well as empty his apartment and sell his car. Soon after, he says he received a call from police telling him to come to the station, where officers showed him screen shots of his comments. Pulled apart: Pate (left) had just proposed to his girlfriend Jillian Cardoza (right) when he was arrested by authorities in the UAE. His trial is set to begin on March 17 . 'I'm being arrested. I'm so sorry. I love you,' Cardoza said he texted her from the station. Pate's congressman, Rep. David Jolly, intervened on his constituent's behalf, lobbying the State Department and Emirates officials for help. In a letter to the Emirati attorney general, Jolly emphasized respect for the sovereignty of the country, but argued because the posts occurred while Pate was on American soil, those laws shouldn't apply. 'It is deeply troubling that Mr. Pate now faces judicial proceedings over an action that was done legally in his home country,' the Republican said. The Emirati Embassy in Washington said it did not have much information about the case and couldn't comment. An after-hours email to the company, Global Aerospace Logistics, did not get an immediate reply. Pate said he's trying not to think too much about the sentence he could face. He says he's remorseful for letting his emotions get the best of him. A GoFundMe page has been set up to support Pate.

All article text:Escaped jail: Eva Jaciskova, pictured in Ugg-style boots outside court today, stole £7,000 worth of shoes while working at Russell and Bromley . A shop assistant stole more than £7,000 of shoes by walking home in a new pair every day. Russell and Bromley worker Eva Jaciskova slipped on a pair of designer shoes at the end of each shift at the Oxford Street store without anyone noticing. Once home, Jaciskova would put the shoes up for sale on eBay, Southwark Crown Court heard. The mother-of-two, who was yesterday spared a jail sentence, walked off with £7,363-worth of shoes before staff noticed a large amount of the shop’s stock was advertised on eBay. Jaciskova, 37, who lives in High Wycombe, was then hauled into a meeting and initially denied stealing 26 pairs of shoes, before later admitting to her crime. Sitting in the dock wearing a pair of tatty, black Ugg-style boots, she wept as details of her theft were read to the court. Jaciskova had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of theft at a magistrate’s court in February. Yesterday, prosecutor Peter Zinner said: ‘This is a breach of trust case. The defendant was an employee of Russell and Bromley in Oxford Street and she was employed by the store as a sales assistant. ‘It transpired in June last year that significant amounts of Russell and Bromley stock had found their way for sale on an eBay account. 'In particular seven pairs of shoes and this is the initial tranche of shoes the defendant stole.’ Jaciskova, originally from Presov, Slovakia, stole shoes from the brand’s Diva, Laura and Skater ranges – with some pairs worth up to £400 each. Mr Zinner said: ‘She admitted what she had done was take the shoes out of the boxes from the stock room over a period of weeks, worn them home and then placed them on eBay to sell. There was an element of pre-planning and deviousness because the defendant left empty boxes in the right place in the stock room.’ Jaciskova initially avoided prosecution by agreeing to hand in her resignation the day she was accused of the theft. ‘However the staff were concerned that in fact that was just the tip of the iceberg because a significant number of shoes had gone missing from the stock room and a further 19 pairs of shoes were discovered having been stolen,’ Mr Zinner added. Serial thief: After stealing the designer footwear from Russell & Bromley, above, the mother would then sell them on eBay . ‘Because the defendant had not volunteered the extent of her criminality and the second tranche significantly increased the loss to the company it was reported to the police and on November 24 last year the defendant attended High Wycombe police station.’ Robert Conway, representing Jaciskova, said his client was ‘truly ashamed and regretful’. He added that she suffered a ‘medical condition’ that she was now getting treatment for. Judge Michael Grieve acknowledged she stole because she had been in financial difficulty, so instead of jail sentenced her to a 12-month community order with a three month curfew attached. He said to Jaciskova: ‘I am told and I can see from your behaviour at the moment that the realisation of your behaviour and being found out – that combination has caused you shame and regret.’ Jaciskova, of High Wycombe, pleaded guilty to a single count of theft but avoided a jail at her hearing at Southwark Crown Court, above .

All article text:Germany should pay reparations to Greece for ‘serious wrongs’ by the Nazis, members of Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition said last night. The German Chancellor has angrily rejected demands from Greek ministers for Berlin to pay £240billion in compensation for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. But, in an astonishing twist, senior members of the SPD, which shares power with Mrs Merkel, yesterday disagreed. Senior figures in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition partner in government  have united with the Green Party to declare Germany should compensate Greece to the tune of billions of pounds for wartime Nazi atrocities . Gesine Schwan said: ‘I think it would be good for us Germans to sweep up after ourselves in terms of our history. It is about recognising that we have committed serious wrongs in Greece. ‘The government’s legal case isn’t convincing. It leaves a bad impression that Germany doesn’t want to face up to its responsibilities.’ Ralf Stegner, SPD deputy leader, said: ‘We should not link the question of compensation with the current debate on the euro crisis. But I am of the opinion that we need to discuss compensation regardless.’ Green party parliamentary group leader Anton Hofreiter said: ‘Neither morally nor legally is this chapter complete.’ About 250,000 Greeks died during the brutal Nazi occupation. Greece’s new hard-Left rulers are demanding billions in return. Justice minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos said this month that German assets in Greece could be seized. Athens is demanding general compensation as well as specific claims for massacres and forced loans. Some senior German politicians view the Greek demand for up to £250billion  in reparations for the Nazi occupation as a ploy to gain more time and money to settle its chronic debt crisis. Pictured is an anti-austerity and pro-government demonstration in Athens that took place in February . German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble has said: ‘They won’t get their debts paid by conjuring German obligations from World War Two.’ Mrs Merkel’s spokesman said the question was ‘legally and politically closed’. But Eberhard Rondholz, a historian who has studied the issue, told the Financial Times: ‘The government view is false. This issue is not closed – it is very much open.’ Spiegel news magazine yesterday said lawyers have told Mrs Merkel the Greeks may have a case. It says that a £2billion loan the Third Reich secured from Greece in 1942 was never repaid – £10billion today. Germany paid Greece £50million in 1960, but Athens says it was not enough.

A bear-hug from the premier heralded the start of the 21-year-old's first shift back at the Martin Place cafe, which has been restored to its former glory with the shelves adorned with chocolates in time for Easter. Of those staff members caught up in the fatal siege, only Mr Herat chose to return to work on reopening day, but Daily Mail Australia has been told by Lindt management 'that several others are expected to take up shifts in the coming weeks, it will be entirely their decision when to come back'.

The cafe's doors reopened to the public at 10am on Friday - around the same time a shotgun-wielding Man Haron Monis ordered the doors locked shut on December 15 last year. Monis held 18 staff and customers captive for 16 hours before the siege was ended in a hail of gunfire, which claimed his life and the lives of cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson. NSW Premier Mike Baird visited the café before it officially opened on Friday morning, where he spoke with staff and gave Mr Herat a hug. 'Joel is in there today - I don't think any of us could imagine what that would be like and I said to him that the city was very proud of him,' Mr Baird told journalists in Martin Place. 'Proud of him being able to be strong in spite of what he went through and that's very clear the thoughts in relation to Tori and Katrina are strong in there. 'There's a strong sense of comradeship that says we can get through this together, we are stronger together, just as the city has marched forward today.'

Operations Manager Sarah Anderson (right) said: 'We are very positive and there's a great feeling of support' The fact the reopening coincides with another celebratory time, Easter, was not lost on Operations Manager Sarah Anderson, after the events 10 days before last Christmas. 'Absolutely it's an important time - we are very positive and there's a great feeling of support,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Another Lindt employee, Lauren Tench, was off shift that fateful day but she wore a beaming smile as she went through last minute checks of table settings. 'It's good to see everyone again, definitely great to see the people waiting outside for us to open,' she said. 'Just before Easter, that means everything to us.' Former Lindt employee Karen Cox, who worked alongside Tori Johnson for many months helping to set up the store in Martin Place, will host a private function at the Lindt Café on Saturday for 30 people, to pay homage to the late manager and also remember Katrina Dawson. Ms Cox left Lindt in November of last year, a month before the fatal siege, but returned on Friday for the reopening.

'For me I was very, very, shaky when I was first standing in line and walking into the store but I knew I had to do it because I was supporting the Lindt team,' she said. 'Tori was a wonderful person, I knew him from the things I'd implemented for the store, he always took care of us, even working with Tori implementing the store I knew how lovely he was, he was chosen because how brilliant he was. 'I knew him very well and I also knew Katrina very well, as well.' Ms Cox said Mr Herat's decision to come back to work straight away took a lot of courage. 'Just wonderful, they all decided on their own if or when they wanted to come back, I think it's a wonderful thing that they want to and the fact Lindt has supported them. 'It just proves how strong we are as an Australian community and that we all bond together like we did when it happened. 'When it first happened we were devastated, very sombre, but they are in there today and they are working their butts off.' Man Haron Monis held 18 staff and customers captive for 16 hours before the siege was ended in a hail of gunfire, which claimed his life . Monis forced his hostages to hold an Islamic flag in the window of the cafe . One of the many customers waiting outside - first in line - was Praveen Swarup. 'It's about the solidarity,' he said. 'I'm not intentionally here to be the first person - it's to be here with everybody and to show our support and that nothing will dampen our spirits. 'We wanted this cafe to reopen, it's in a premium location and we love our city and I enjoyed visiting this before,' he added. Security was tight but heavily armed police stood aside, mostly out of view but holding a watching brief across all corners of Martin Place. Standing at the back of the line of up to 100 people, with a bouquet of flowers was Alan Sexgon. 'Terrorism will fail as long as the people experiencing it don't let it divide them - we are very proud to be Australian and are united,' he said .

Mr Loane said the company was committed to making 'today a happy day to celebrate that we're back and we're open with the support of all the staff'. 'But really they're in a great mood and they're ready to go, and they really want to welcome customers in,' Mr Loane said. Staff members voted on the return date and the 10am opening. Regular trading hours begin on Saturday. The store has undergone a refit since the events of last December and workmen have plastered over bullet holes and other damage that was suffered at the dramatic end of the 16-hour siege. It follows a one-day session in January that heard Ms Dawson was killed by ricocheting fragments of a police bullet or bullets after officers stormed the Sydney cafe following the execution of Mr Johnson by Monis . Renovations have been carried out on the Martin Place cafe since the tragedy . Labor Leader Luke Foley will take time from the NSW election campaign to wish Lindt staff  well later in the day. Premier  Baird, who visited the cafe at 9.30am, recently told AAP he was still uncomfortable passing by the cafe, which is nearby to his office and state parliament. 'I can't really look at the cafe without feeling these pangs of despair at what took place,' he said. 'I know over time that will heal but ... the impacts are still pretty raw.' A May date has been set for a two-week inquest into the deaths of Ms Dawson, Mr Johnson and gunman Monis in the Lindt Cafe siege. It follows a one-day session in January that heard Ms Dawson was killed by ricocheting fragments of a police bullet or bullets after officers stormed the Sydney cafe following the execution of Mr Johnson by Monis. The first part of the hearing, which will run from May 25 until June 5, will focus on the background of Monis and related issues, a spokesman for the NSW Coroner's Court said on Wednesday. More than 60 witnesses and experts are expected to appear during the entire cafe inquest, which is being presided over by State Coroner Michael Barnes and will run throughout the year. Findings are expected to be delivered in early 2016. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The aim of stripping the property for the sale was to attract a buyer who can stamp their personality on it. The gamble worked. Mr Fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four-floor apartment on the Gold Coast. The apartment with its own opulent pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque, became Australia's most expensive penthouse, in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $17 million. But the deal with Brisbane businessman Charlie Caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute. Since then, the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls, the ceiling and even the kitchen sink. Scroll down for video . Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same . The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer . The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline . The 63-year-old Hong Kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love. He is planning to develop an $8.15 billion 'Aquis' casino and resort in Yorkey's Knob, Cairns, causing much controversy among locals. McGrath agent James Ledgerwood told The Courier Mail that this high profile buyer will attract a lot of attention to the Soul building. 'Given the new owner and his expectations, it's safe to say it will become one of the icons of penthouses in Australia.' Ledgerwood also added that spaces like this one are unique due to their versatility. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting Mr Fung's personal touch . Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia . 'It's similar to buying a vacant house lot, but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in Queensland,' he said. A spokesperson for Mr. Fung said that he was ecstatic with the recent purchase. 'It is a vote of confidence in the Queensland economy and an important addition to his property holdings in the state,' he said. Fung already owns 447 hectares worth of properties in the Gold Coast hinterland as well as an Innisfail farm, a private golf course in Noosa and he purchased Casino Canberra in December. Agent James Legerwood had previously told Daily Mail Australia that this property was a rare gem, particularly on the Gold Coast in Australia. He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it. All cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the 'old Aurora'. It's been gutted after the $17 million sale fell through . McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast' As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . As it is now. The luxurious pool-side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out . 'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added. The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said. At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland . Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area had been cleared out prior to the auction . However, Ledgerwood added it had some serious appeal. It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'. 'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said. 'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.' The auction that saw Tony Fung one more Australian property richer, took place on March 7. Dream views. 'You look up to Stradbroke (Island) and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice' said Mr Ledgerwood . With views like this, it's little wonder Mr Ledgewood claims 'there has been plenty of local and international interest' about Aurora - the Soul Penthouse on the Gold Coast which had been stripped bare .

All article text:Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has had his players training at Selhurst Park in the hope of exploiting a set-piece advantage over Queens Park Rangers in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off. Palace’s home form this season is the second worst in the Barclays Premier League, with bottom-side Leicester City the only club worse than them on home turf. The Selhurst Park pitch has been re-laid twice this season, and with Pardew admitting the surface ‘isn’t perfect’, he has called his players into the stadium that they face QPR in on Saturday to practice their dead-ball routines. Alan Pardew admits Crystal Palace have been training at Selhurst Park ahead of their match against QPR . Since taking over at Palace, Pardew has helped take the south London club up the Premier League . ‘Our home form is something that we’re focusing on,’ Pardew said. ‘Really, we’ve done enough to stay in the division away from home already but our home form doesn’t reflect what it should be. ‘Our stadium needs to be rocking tomorrow and if we want to keep it where it is in terms of that support, you’ve got to give them wins. ‘We’re a good set-play team so we’ve been getting used to the co-ordinates here and the environment to make sure our set-plays are on the money tomorrow. QPR will be desperate for points at Selhurst Park on Saturday lunchtime, after seven defeats in their last eight . Chris Ramsey has endured a difficult start to life in the managerial hot-seat at Loftus Road . ‘This new pitch is good, but it’s not perfect. The Premier League pitches don’t really get relaid during the season, they’re perfect, so it’s very unusual for us to have to do that. I can’t say it’s as good as Arsenal’s, Swansea’s or Newcastle’s, because it isn’t.’ And Pardew sees Palace’s game against QPR as being more important for the visitors than his side, even though he admits both are still in a relegation scrap. ‘It’s an important game,’ he said. ‘Probably more important for QPR than us, with where they are, those three teams down the bottom (QPR, Burnley and Leicester) really need a quick win to get them in touch again so it’s a huge game for them – probably must-win. Palace's away form has been impressive, but Pardew admits they need to improve their fortunes at home . The Selhurst Park pitch has been relaid twice this season, and is not as impressive as other top flight clubs . ‘For us, we just need to make sure we pick up points or pick up wins when we can and we’ll be ok. We have a cushion at the moment but it can be easily eroded with a defeat tomorrow so we need to make sure that we’re on our metal.’ Palace, with 30 points, are currently eight points clear of third-bottom QPR but Pardew still believes it will require a further 10 before his side are sure of staying up.

All article text:A team hunting for the legendary 'lost city' of Ciudad Blanca in Honduras has made a dramatic discovery of untouched ruins deep in the jungle that are thought to be thousands of years old, according to National Geographic. Researchers believe the complex of plazas, mounds, a pyramid and dozens of artefacts belong to a civilization which was blooming thousands of years ago and then vanished without a trace. It prompts the tantalizing possibility that they have found the lost civilization known as the White City, which as been the subject of local rumors among tribes people and Spanish explorers around the la Mosquita area of jungle in Honduras for hundreds of years. Some people call it the White City Of Gold, after ancient texts described ivory temples filled with treasure - and western explorers first made reference to it from conquistador Hernando Cortes to King Charles V of Spain in 1526. Since then countless adventurers have scoured the jungle for the ancient civilization, rumored to have enjoyed treasures beyond the wildest dreams of many budding Indiana Jones'. One such adventurer even suggested that the city was in fact known as the White City of the Monkey God, and saw an ancient civilization worship a giant simian deity, symbolized by a large statue. Theodore Morde, writing of his adventures in US  magazine The American Weekly, said that local tribes people told him of the monkey worshiping civilization and went on with even more outlandish suggestions that a monkey from the city. Locals even told him that one 'monkey god' from the city kidnapped a local woman and bred half-human, half-chimp children. The children were then hunted for revenge. Local tribes people also reportedly related the same story to an anthropologist, according to a Honduran media report. Morde said that local people told him of a huge monkey temple inhabited by a civilization known as the Chorotegas, and claimed to have fond evidence of such a place on his expedition in 1939-40. But Morde never revealed the location of his alleged find and killed himself in 1954. Scroll down for video . A sign of history? This block of stone could be a remnant of a temple built in the Lost City of Honduras thousands of years ago . Incredible: The aerial shots taken by National Geographic show luscious forestland where the City Of The Monkey God once thrived . However, despite archaeologists' following attempts to detect man-made structures - whether they be from Ciudad Blanca, The White City of the Monkey God or elsewhere -  have been unsuccessful. Until now. Traveling into uncharted territory last month, a National Geographic team found the mounds of white rubble in the shape of a monkey's skull that experts believe to be thousands of years old. The National Geographic's Douglas Preston wrote: 'The tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth. Many more evidently lie below ground, with possible burials. 'They include stone ceremonial seats (called metates) and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, zoomorphic figures, and vultures. 'The most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what Fisher speculated might be 'a were-jaguar,' possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed, spirit state. 'Alternatively, the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of pre-Columbian life in Mesoamerica.' According to Theodore Morde, stone effigies of monkeys lined the approach to the city's central temple, which was built in the shape of the monkey God. He described the myth: 'One day three of the hairy men who looked like great apes walked into an Indian village and carried off three of its most beautiful and pleasing maidens. 'They took the girls back into the caves high in the mountains to live with them and bear their children. 'From this union came, however, not human nor partly human children but the small Urus or monkeys.' Discovery? American explorer Theodore Morde (left) wrote in 1939 that he had discovered the fabled city described by conquistador Hernando Cortes centuries before. Speaking to locals, he learned the city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured (right) hiding Rama and Sita, two more Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. The Honduran monkey God is more menacing, he said . The lost city, believed to be full of gold, has merited two names based on legends. Texts cite 'la Ciudad Blanca' or 'the White City' it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and old reports describe elaborately carved white stones. Other reports claim there once stood a giant monkey-shaped temple. There were also tales of a monkey stealing three women in the city and raping them to create half-monkey, half-human babies, warranting the name: The City Of The Monkey God. Either way, it has been sought since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to King Charles V of Spain. It inspired the Dance Of The Dead Monkeys, during which locals roast monkeys over a fire in an apparent act of revenge for stealing their virgins. The first mention of the city came in Hernando Cortes' fifth letter to King Charles V of Spain in 1926, when he wrote that it will 'exceed Mexico in riches'. Historians believe, based on his description, that the city was in the region of Mosquitia - which was then, and remains now, impenetrably dangerous. '…I have trustworthy reports of very extensive and rich provinces,' he wrote, 'and of powerful chiefs ruling over them, and of one in particular, called Hueitapalan, and in another dialect Xucutaco, about which I possessed information six years since, having all this time made inquiries about it, and ascertained that it lies eight or ten days' march from that town of Trujillo, or rather between fifty and sixty leagues. 'So wonderful are the reports about this particular province, that even allowing largely for exaggeration, it will exceed Mexico in riches, and equal it in the largeness of its towns and villages, the density of its population, and the policy of its inhabitants.' Centuries later, in 1939, Theodore Morde rediscovered the site, and learned from locals that it was home to the myth of the monkey God. Writing in the Milwaukee Sentinel on September 22, 1940, apologized to his readers that he could not reveal the exact location other than the fact that it was shrouded by towering mountains, a 'rushing cataract, beautiful as a robe of shimmering jewels, cascading into the green valley of the ruins.' He added: 'More definite location than this I cannot give, because, as I have written, many are they who have sought for the Monkey God's City, attracted by tales of treasure, and we want to find it unmolested on our return journey in January.' His words have been echoed decades later by the Virgilio Parades, director of the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH), who warned the city and the surrounding rainforest could be obliterated in eight years if the government does not rush to protect it, El Heraldo reported. The latest discovery comes after researchers from the University of . Houston and the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) flew . over the Mosquitia region in a small plane shooting billions of laser . pulses at the ground to create a 3D digital map of the topology beneath . the jungle canopy. Compiling . their data, the analysts revealed what appears to be man-made elevation . changes that are thought to show a forgotten city plaza dotted with . pyramids reclaimed by the jungle. According to legend, Ciudad Blanca or the 'White City' is full of gold and has been sought out by explorers and treasure hunters since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to King Charles V of Spain. Inspired by this legend, cinematographer and Ciudad Blanca enthusiast Steven Elkins sought backing from private investors to pay for the team at NCLAM to use their laser mapping technology to chart the forest floor of Mosquitia. Over the course of a week, the NCALM and University of Houston engineers flew over 60 square miles of forest in their dual-engine Cessna planes. LiDAR's computer-generated images allow researchers to 'see' through the . forest canopy to the ground surface, revealing any evidence of ancient . settlements or human-engineered landscapes. 'The LiDAR point cloud data clearly show the remains of large . settlements that can be characterized as ancient cities based on their . spatial complexity, size and organization,' said  Colorado State University professors Christopher Fisher, who led the research. 'We may never . be able to tell whether any of these are Ciudad Blanca, or whether the . legendary city ever existed, but we can clearly see in the UTL data . evidence that there was a densely settled region with a human modified . environment. 'These conclusions provide important new insights into the . pre-Hispanic settlement of this largely unexplored region.' This was one of the first times that . laser mapping, specifically light detection and ranging (LiDAR) had been . used to locate ancient ruins. Investigation: The University of Houston and National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping team produced this 3D digital topological map which when examined shows a man-made plaza ringed in red . The researchers first flew over the area and captured the treeline (top), and then were able to 'see through'  to the ground below (bottom image) The original uses of the technology were to provide intelligence after earthquakes, military spying and for river erosion detection. Flying above the intended target area, LiDAR operates by sending out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second. The University of Houston and the NCALM team blanketed the Mosquitia rainforest with as many as 25-50 laser pulses every square metre that totaled up as more than four billion shots during the entire project. Ciudad Blanca has played a central role in Central American mythology. Texts cite it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and previous reported sightings over the years have described golden idols and elaborately carved white stones, leading to the lost city's name. However, no confirmation of the existence of the city has ever been provided. If confirmed, the discovery of Ciudad Blanca would be comparable to the popularisation of forgotten sites such as Machu Picchu, which lay ruined for hundreds of years until reintroduced to western eyes in 1911 by American historian Hiram Bingham.

The naughty 10-year-old stunned teachers when he decided to clamber up the plush stone front of the museum on the school trip with his class. But when he reached the top of a 40ft stone column his 'Spiderboy' adventure came to an end when he burst into tears and was unable to bring himself down. Scroll down for video . The 10-year-old climbed  up the exterior of the National Museum Wales building (left) in Cardiff, but had to be rescued by firemen after he became stuck with fear behind the right column at a height of 40ft (right) Fire crews were called out by frantic teachers and had to use a large ladder to reach the boy stuck at the National Museum Wales building in Cardiff. The pupil had climbed the gaps in the dressed stone frontage before becoming stuck. Onlooker Jayce Enfader, 34, said: 'I came out of the museum and saw everyone staring up at this 10-year-old boy - it was like something out of Spiderman. He was wedged in against the wall and a huge stone column. 'I'm sure he's a pain in the neck for his teachers but you had to feel sorry for the lad - he had his hands over his face and was crying his eyes out.' The schoolboy got stuck yesterday on a class trip to the museum which houses dinosaur fossils, a national history gallery and an extensive collection of world renowned artworks. A spokesman for South Wales Fire and Rescue said that they had been called to the museum at 1.20pm with reports that a boy was stuck in a 'precarious position'. He said they used an extension ladder to help rescue the boy safely and had worked with South Wales Police throughout. A National Museum Wales spokesperson said: 'We can confirm that a school pupil had attempted to climb up part of the building at the front of National Museum. 'We are very grateful to the emergency services for their work in bringing him down safely. We are pleased the situation has been resolved and no harm caused.'

All article text:This is the moment a group of thrill-seeking skydivers were given the unforgettable opportunity to jump from the bomb bay doors of a military aeroplane. Arranged by Chicagoland Skydiving Center, the special event was enjoyed by 10 people who dropped from the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in the skies over Rochelle, Illinois. Exiting the aircraft from 5,000ft, the skydivers each made a donation of $500 (£340) to the Collings Foundation – the non-profit organisation that operates the plane – in order to take part in the jump. One of the skydivers jumps out of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress through its bomb bay doors . Each skydiver made a donation of $500 (£340) to the Collings Foundation to take part in the jump . Filmed on GoPro cameras attached to helmets, the video begins with the skydivers boarding the heavy bomber aircraft at an airport in Rockford, Illinois. Developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Corps, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber aircraft. The prototype B-17 was designed and built at Boeing’s own expense by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and Edward Curtis Wells. Boeing chief test-pilot Leslie Tower was at the controls of the Model 299 when it made its maiden flight on July 28, 1935. The name Flying Fortress was used to describe the aircraft because the Model 299 included multiple machine gun installations. The B-17 served numerous USAAF units in combat throughout World War II and was even used by the RAF in non-bomber roles. The B-17 Flying Fortress has become a symbol of power and the America Air Force. Capturing the closed bay doors from the inside of the plane, the video switches to show the aircraft's large propellers starting up before the B-17 leaves the runway. In the air, one of the skydivers checks out the numerous guns attached to the aircraft as well as the two pilots driving it from the cockpit. Before long the B-17 is cruising at around 5,000ft and the bay doors can be seen opening via a camera mounted to the bottom on the plane. Inside the skydivers stand over the opening floor and hold on to the railings on either side as Northern Illinois comes into view below. Waiting for the right moment, the skydivers then begin dropping from the plane at different times – as the camera underneath picks up their rapid exits. The video concludes with footage recorded from a GoPro, which shows the plane moving further away as the skydiver gets closer to the ground. Mike Wood, Chief Operations Officer at Chicagoland Skydiving Center and one of the jumpers in the video, spoke enthusiastically about the experience. One of the skydivers said jumping out of the bay doors was one of the most incredible experiences of his life . The special event was enjoyed by 10 people who dropped from the plane in the skies over Rochelle, Illinois . He told Newsflare: ‘I've been skydiving for more than 30 years and a pilot for more than 20, and the B-17 jump was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. ‘As a pilot and a jumper, it's a privilege to have had a ride in this plane. 'Watching the bomb bay doors open below my feet was a sight I will never forget.’ The Chicagoland Skydiving Center conduct numerous skydives every year with specialty aircraft being brought to its drop zone in Illinois. The Collings Foundation raises money to cover maintenance costs by bringing war planes to air shows across the US.
