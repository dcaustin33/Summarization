Article text: I'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years. Most of my friends hint, imply or say it's my fault for being too shallow, picky and prone to falling for bad boys. I use Tinder, the dating app synonymous with casual sex, to meet attractive men who meet my high standards. Yvette Caster, 33, had been single for four years, before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on Tinder for a week . It's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they can't even message you. If you like them you swipe right and, if they feel the same, you can chat. Most of the time I swipe right to one in 50 - many are too old (over 35), too young (under 25), too dull (into sport), too much of a party animal or simply too ugly. But, after another friend accused me of being picky, I decided to see what would happen if I swiped right to ALL men on Tinder for a week. Here's what happened. Sunday . The first day is the worst. Within a few minutes I've swiped right to someone with head to foot tattoos, a man with his three children and lots of frowning blokes in their pants. After an hour I'm exhausted, depressed and have opened the flood gates for 80, mostly unsuitable, suitors. Monday . I get up at 6.30am to swipe right to man who looks like a serial killer, a Ricky Gervais double and a range of football logos (you can put any image as your profile picture). Then a message from Tinder appears. They've noticed my promiscuous swiping and I can't 'like' another man for another 24 hours. Why would I want to? I've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am. After the first day of swiping right to all men, the London-based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages, all before 9am . Tuesday . I have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being 'too picky'. The fact they want to talk to me is a revelation. I usually have messages from two men a week, tops. Of the 22, a couple are lascivious but the majority are from nice, down to earth guys. It's just a shame so few of them can spell. I haven't messaged any of them first, either, as I prefer them to do the chasing. Wednesday . It's only just dawning on me how much admin is involved in being promiscuous. Keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing, especially when so many men are called Dave. At times I copy and paste the same message to all the guys, which is rude but it's either that or no reply. I can't quite believe so many of them are being so polite. My normal Tinder experience, picking only the hot guys, is sleazy pick up lines followed by unsolicited pictures or their penis or even indecent videos. Maybe I really could find a boyfriend this way after all. Tinder clocked on to Yvette's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from 'liking' anyone else for 24 hours . Thursday . The chats have gone so well that I've given my number to three men, although I'm still doubtful about whether I could be physically attracted to them. On the one hand, this whole thing feels slightly immoral, or at least an exercise in leading men on. But on the other, if I think about my exes, I'd probably have swiped left to at least a couple as they won me over with charm and humour, not looks. Friday . I've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates, not hook ups. One guy has outright asked to be my boyfriend. Another, who is far too young really, has been keeping me entertained with perfect flirty texts. I'm starting to think this is the way forward. The 33-year-old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick-up lines (left), whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships . Saturday . Just because I can, I go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards (yuk), men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to Star Wars screen grabs. I also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for. In the end, none of them prove to be The One, but I did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation. Would I do it again? Why not? Some men need a chance to win your heart while others, well, they're just very bad at choosing profile pics.

Article text: Oh Gawd, not more kitchen scenes! After the Milibands’ two-kitchens saga, last night the BBC took us to David Cameron’s constituency kitchen in Oxfordshire in the latest example of ‘Hello’ television political coverage. It was there that the PM announced that he might not look for a third term in Downing Street. Er, might be worth waiting until you’ve won a second one before you start talking about a third, comrade. Scroll down for videos . 1. Ceiling lights, £22 each, Ikea – From ‘Foto Pendant’ range. 2. Sage by Heston Blumenthal's Nutri-Juicer Pro, £299, johnlewis.com.

Whatever, the BBC’s James Landale was shown chopping vegetables with the PM as lunch was prepared for the Cameron family. The slinky Samantha, looking as though she was just out of some foam-scented bath, wandered towards the cooking area in a loose-fitting lumberjack shirt and announced that her husband was ‘definitely the best man for the job’. She added that ‘me and the family’ (did they not teach grammar at her public school?) kept him grounded. Kept him in the kitchen chopping carrots, more like. But what a healthy lot the Cams are. Did you see those lettuce leaves in the colander? No wonder he has lost weight, poor man. Can a man really run a country on rabbit food? This latest up-close-and-gooey film with a party leader – which came after the Miliband domestic epic disaster, and a little-noticed shocker with Nick Clegg and his parents – started with Mr Cameron on the touchline at a children’s football game in his Witney constituency. His son Elwen, aged nine, was playing. ‘Come on, Chads! Great save!’ bawled the PM, making sure the camera crew had a good view of him. Mr Cameron said that he felt ‘fit enough’ for another term of the premiership, and would be gutted if he lost the election. It was country casuals time. The aesthetic was one of Boden clothes and gummies and Chelsea tractors in Oxfordshire lanes. In the kitchen it was Belfast sinks and nourishing stews. Then came a moment from the Carry On films, surely. We followed Mr Cameron on a visit to his butcher. Chicken was on the shopping list. Past: David Cameron invited the cameras into his kitchen in Oxfordshire in 2006 - and commenters said that it now looks a lot more cluttered . Labour leader Ed Miliband previously allowed the cameras into his 'second kitchen' - an area for snack-making in his north London home . Mr Cameron: ‘I like the thighs because they’re very juicy.’ Ooh, missus. Kenneth Williams or Frankie Howerd could not have delivered it better. The butcher did not seem entirely keen to take part in the political promo’. Reporter Landale enquired if ‘David’ was the shop’s most famous customer. No answer from the man with the sharp knife and bloody apron (borrowed from the PM after his last reshuffle?). But Mr Cameron announced that one Jeremy Clarkson sometimes visited the butcher. So now we know where Clarkson gets his old beefs. Talking of the Top Gear presenter, Mr Cameron disclosed that his daughter Nancy, 11, had threatened that very morning to go on a hunger strike if Clarkson was dropped by the BBC. Oops. Tricky moment for Landale and his editors. But to their credit they kept it in. Mr Cameron said he had told Nancy that this was ‘not exactly Gandhi’ (a reference to the emaciated Indian Mahatma who used to fast in protest at British imperialism). Later we learned that Nancy had tucked into a hearty lunch, so her hunger strike had ‘lasted five minutes’, said her father. Longer than some election promises, darling. Kitchens update: Not to be outdone, ITV earlier in the day gave us an interview from the sparse wee scullery of gnasher-toothed Scots Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon. It looked about as warm and inviting as the sea off Aberdeen.

Article text: Wayne Rooney is on course to break Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time goalscoring record at the club, but the Manchester United captain has struggled to find the net at the home of one their fiercest rivals. Ahead of Sunday's crunch clash at Anfield, Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal will be hoping his star striker can lead by example when United travel to Liverpool. Rooney was on target as United swept aside Tottenham at Old Trafford on March 15 - taking his league tally to 11 this season. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal will be hoping Wayne Rooney can fire them to glory at Liverpool . Rooney (centre) scored in United's 3-0 win vs Tottenham on March 15 but has struggled at Anfield in the past . However, the 29-year-old's record at Anfield is a poor one during his time at United and at boyhood club Everton. In 10 appearances at the ground, Rooney has only managed to score once. That goal proved decisive though as United ran out 1-0 winners against Liverpool in January 2005. Since then however, the stats make for unimpressive reading for Van Gaal's talisman - with the forward having failed to score in his subsequent seven appearances at Anfield. Rooney has only scored once in 10 matches at Liverpool during his time at Everton and United . Rooney (left) celebrates his strike with Cristiano Ronaldo in 2005 as United won 1-0 at Anfield . Furthermore he has only produced two shots on target in total in those following matches and nine overall. Despite this, Van Gaal will be hoping Rooney can rediscover his goalscoring touch at Anfield as United battle for a place in the top four against Brendan Rodgers' side. Defeat for United would see them drop below Liverpool into fifth with just eight Premier League games remaining. Since that goal though, Rooney (centre) has failed to score in seven subsequent matches at Anfield . In additio, the 29-year-old has only produced two shots on target in total in those following matches .

Article text: A paleo cookbook for infants co-authored by My Kitchen Rules chef Pete Evans has been delayed over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. One recipe is a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - one of Evans' signature Paleo creations. Scroll down for video . Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The cookbook is the joint venture of celebrity chef Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way was marketed as 'simple, delicious paleo recipes for new mothers, babies and toddlers' by 'health crusaders' Carr,  Padarin and Evans, who 'have seen firsthand the positive impact a paleo way of eating has had on their families' wellbeing'. The greatest concern, especially given that none of the authors have medical qualifications, lie with the do-it-yourself baby formula, which is made primarily from liver and bone broth, reported The Australian Women's Weekly. Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . The broth reportedly contains ten times the recommended daily intake of Vitamin A for infants, but lacks other basic nutrients needed for sustenance. Professor Yeatman said that while adults have the choice to follow the paleo diet, which excludes dairy and grains, parents are responsible for the diet of their children and that it would be unfair for parents to force 'unproven' beliefs on them. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'That's the really troubling thing: the infant is totally at the whim of their parents when it comes to feeding. If the wrong decision is made, they may be seriously affected,' she said. Further concerns have been raised about the inclusion of runny eggs and added salt in the recipes, which contradicts national health guidelines. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. In July last year, the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) criticised the paleo diet, with the association's chief executive officer Claire Hewat labelling the Paleo diet was 'potentially dangerous' and evidence of its benefits 'just doesn't stack up'. The Paleo diet requires people to cut out 'grains, legumes, certain dairy products, conventionally-raised meats, non-organic produce, and genetically modified and processed foods', which Ms Hewart says is not practical for many Australians. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.' Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet, and has come under fire for some of his more controversial claims about the Australian food industry. Evans posted a 2,100 word rant on social media in October last year claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism, taking aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA)  as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet. His fiery rant, which was motivated by a comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet. Pan MacMillan has been contacted for comment.

Recordings of fans at Manchester United and Manchester City chanting and shouting obscenities at Carneiro were broadcast by the BBC on Thursday night, leading to an unequivocal statement from the Blues. A spokesman for the club told the Guardian: 'The issue of equality is one we take extremely seriously and we abhor discrimination in all its forms, including sexism. Such behaviour is unacceptable and we want it eradicated from the game.' Recordings of Manchester United and Manchester City fans shouting abuse were shown on BBC on Thursday . Abuse was directed at Chelsea club doctor Eva Carneiro by opposition fans on seperate occasions . Chelsea have called for an end to sexism in football after fans directed abuse at their club doctor . Campaign group Women in Football is launching an anti-sexism social media drive on Friday and has also contacted all 92 Premier League and Football League clubs asking them to champion female members of staff in their matchday programmes ahead of International Women's Day on March 8. Minister for Sport Helen Grant is supporting the initiative. She said: 'It is absolutely right that we champion and celebrate women who work in the football industry and play vital roles in making the game the success that it is. Demba Ba is treated for a broken nose by Carneiro after being kicked in the face against Newcastle . Carneiro joined Chelsea in 2009 but was promoted to the first team by Andre Villas-Boas in 2011 . 'I want more women to get involved in football across the board and to see it as a great industry to work in. Sexism, in any shape or form, should not be tolerated so I applaud this push to encourage people to report any incidents of sexist abuse and for the promotion of inclusivity across football.' Carolyn Radford, chief executive at Mansfield Town, told the BBC: ‘You are almost made to feel if you should be made to tolerate such abuse. If it was racist language being chanted at me then perhaps people would say something about it, but because it is just banter, so to speak, I’ve got to flick my hair and just accept it.’ Chelsea's Kurt Zouma is tended to by  Carneiro as he is stretchered off after a collision in the penalty area .

The Tottenham striker continued his sensational scoring form this season by netting the final goal in England's 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier defeat of Lithuania shortly after coming on at Wembley on Friday night. However, the 21-year-old's strike was precisely a minute slower than legendary Spurs manager Bill Nicholson while John Cock also scored in less than half the time on his debut for the Three Lions. Harry Kane Wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal . The Spurs striker headed in at the far post from a Raheem Sterling cross shortly after coming at Wembley .

Cock would go on to win only one more cap, scoring against Scotland in 1920. Kane had scored just one Premier League goal when Roy Hodgson's men last took to the field more than four months ago, but his rise has been so rapid that the striker's introduction at Wembley was met by a standing ovation on Friday.

Article text: A Washington police dog has died after he ingested powdered crystal meth during a massive bust that led to 44 pounds of narcotics being seized by authorities. Barney was serving a search warrant with his handler, Tacoma police officer Henry Betts, when he accidentally inhaled the methamphetamine and became sick. The 11-year-old Labrador mix had a body temperature of 109 and was having seizures when he was brought to BluePearl Veterinary Hospital on Tuesday night. Barney, 11, is dead after he ingested powdered crystal meth during a drug bust in Tacoma, Washington . Barney was serving a search warrant when he accidentally inhaled the methamphetamine and became sick . Barney was becoming more alert and responsive by Wednesday morning and doctors and doctors were 'cautiously optimistic' that he would make a full recovery. He died on Thursday. Officer Betts and Barney had been partnered up since 2010. Betts said: 'He's a phenomenal dog. 'Really just incredible.' Narcotics dogs usually signal when drugs are present by placing their noses on the substance. Barney put his sniffer on the unwrapped drugs and came in direct contact with the meth, Q13 Fox reported. Dr. Kobi Johnson said: ''Methamphetamines are extremely toxic to dogs.' As a result of the canine's courageous actions, three men were arrested. Samuel Tafolla Hernandez, 39, Thomas Servantes Diaz, 34, and Jose Mauricio Lozano-Miranda, 38, were all charged Wednesday with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said: 'This is one of the biggest drug busts we've seen in Pierce County in the last decade.' In addition to the meth, officers found $225,000 concealed in a book case during the bust. The men are scheduled to make their initial court appearance Thursday afternoon.

Article text: The president of Sierra Leone has ordered the entire country to stay at home for three days in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola. Ernest Koroma has ordered the entire population into lock down from 6am on March 27 until 6pm on March 29. It comes as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - which have been the centres of the outbreak which has killed more than 10,000 people - have set a goal of cutting off the disease's spread by April 16. The president of Sierra Leone has ordered the entire country to stay at home for three days in a bid to stop the spread of Ebola . The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has claimed almost 3,700 lives in Sierra Leone, one of three impoverished west African nations that have seen their economies and healthcare systems wrecked by the crisis . Koroma said: 'All Sierra Leoneans must stay at home for three days,' he announced, expanding a previous order for a lockdown in the capital Freetown and northern areas of the country nationwide. 'I have made my personal commitment to do whatever it takes to get to zero Ebola infections and I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together,' he added. Liberia had previously reported that it had reached an end to the epidemic in the country but a new case appeared in its capital Monrovia on Friday. The infected woman is the wife of a man already cured of the disease, it has been reported. One of the deadliest viruses known to man, Ebola is spread only through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms, such as fever or vomiting. Health workers from Sierra Leone's Red Cross Society Burial Team carry an ebola victim from a house in Freetown . The World Health Organization said Ebola can still be transmitted in sperm 82 days after a patient carrying the virus is cured. The worst-ever outbreak of the virus has claimed almost 3,700 lives in Sierra Leone, one of three impoverished west African nations that have seen their economies and healthcare systems wrecked by the crisis. 'The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone,' President Koroma said. 'The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake.'

Article text: Church treasurer Mark Conway-Wilcox (pictured) has admitted four counts of theft after stealing £20,000 from St Wilfrid's Church's renovation pot . A trusted church treasurer who stole £20,000 from a renovation pot to fund his gambling habit has narrowly avoided jail. Mark Conway-Wilcox, 30, of Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, admitted four counts of theft after stealing from St Wilfrid's Church's - but claimed the amount he had taken was closer to £15,000. Yesterday he was branded 'unchristian' for leaving the Newcastle church on the brink of closure after stealing the money and blowing it on gambling. Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox also failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured. The court heard Conway-Wilcox became treasurer at St Wilfrid's in May 2013 and was responsible for making sure money was put in the bank and invoices were paid. After receiving complaints about unpaid bills Reverend Sarah Miller initially gave Conway-Wilcox the benefit of the doubt. But matters came to a head in May last year when Ecclesiastical Insurance rang up and told her they had not been paid and that the church and its contents were potentially uninsured. An investigation began and it was discovered Conway-Wilcox had transferred £10,098 from the church's refurbishment account into his own between November 2013 and May 2014. A further £550 had been moved from church bank accounts to his account and Conway-Wilcox failed to bank more than £10,000 in cheques. Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw told the court the total amount misappropriated was £20,856.78. The church has since been paid back £10,000 by the insurance company. St Wilfrid's Church in Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle, was left in danger of closure after Conway-Wilcox failed to pay various bills, had creditors chasing the church and even left it potentially uninsured . Paul Caulfield, defending, told the court: 'He had a horrendous gambling problem, referred himself for help and has attended 20 sessions. 'Since this matter came to light he has not been involved in gambling. 'He is mortified by his conduct and apologises publicly, having apologised privately previously.' Recorder Nicholas Lumley QC told Conway-Wilcox: 'This church serves one of this great city's less fortunate areas and it has a small but committed congregation. 'The church, its fabric and its good work was placed in jeopardy by you. 'And why? Well, because of your greed. You saw them as a soft target and a ready source of cash for your own frailties and you plundered what money they had. 'You took advantage of your position of trust by stealing from various bank accounts and when it was queried you stalled, prevaricated and lied. 'Not only is it unchristian it is thoroughly dishonest.' Newcastle Crown Court heard Conway-Wilcox left the Newcastle church on the brink of closure . Martin Sheppard, of the Diocese of Newcastle, said: 'It's been a very sad story for Martin, for his family and the church family at Newbiggin Hall. It's been a very difficult time for the congregation. 'We don't understand why he did what he did. Everyone feels great sorrow and regret. 'As I understand it, the money that was taken was money that people had been collecting for the renovation work for a church hall facility in the Newbiggin Hall area. 'The money was collected by faithful members of the church and now they have been set back in their project to serve the community where they live,work and worship.' Conway-Wilcox was handed an eight month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £5,000 compensation to St Wilfrid's.

Article text: Militants fighting for the Islamic State have now turned their savagery on the dead, tearing down graves and smashing tombs at a cemetery in Syria. Not content with the rape and massacre of the estimated four million brutally oppressed people living under the terror group's control in  Syria and Iraq, ISIS jihadis are now victimising the dead. Claiming gravestones and tombs are a form of veneration of the dead and only distract from the worship of Allah, the heavily-armed, camouflage-wearing militants are seen happily reducing the hilltop cemetery to large piles of rubble as they pull town and smash the stone monuments.

As some of the elder militants take a break, a group of tracksuit-wearing teenagers take over the destruction, using a spade to scrape away the edges of a tomb while young children look on. A final image appears to show the militants gathering some of the debris from the site - ostensibly to be taken away and used as building material in Raqqa - the capital of the province and the de facto capital of the terrorists' self-declared caliphate. Location: The chilling images are believed to have been taken in the Syrian province of Raqqa and shows a hilltop cemetery overlooking what appears to be farmland . Two camouflage-wearing militants are seen pulling over gravestones at the cemetery in Raqqa province . The chilling images emerged as thousands of Syrians fled Idlib province over the weekend, fearing government reprisals a day after opposition fighters and a powerful local Al Qaeda affiliate captured the northwestern town, activists said. Idlib, with a population of around 165,000 people, is the second provincial capital to fall to the opposition after Raqqa, which is now a stronghold of the Islamic State group. Its capture by several factions led by the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front underscores the growing power of extremist groups in Syria, who now control about half the country. The Nusra Front and Syrian rebels have controlled the countryside and towns across Idlib province since 2012, but Assad's forces had maintained their grip on Idlib city, near the border with Turkey, throughout the conflict. Now that the city is in the hands of rebels, who stormed government buildings and tore down posters of Assad, many residents fear that troops will retaliate harshly. Teamwork: A man wearing a traditional red and white Arabic headdress destroys a gravestone while another militant carrying a large AK47 assault rifle looks on . A final image appears to show the militants gathering some of the debris from the site - ostensibly to be taken away and used as building material in Raqqa - the  de facto capital of the terrorists' self-declared caliphate . Muayad Zurayk, an activist based in Idlib province, said via Skype that 'residents are fleeing the city to nearby villages and towns.' He added that the situation was relatively quiet in the city yesterday despite some government shelling. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, confirmed some people were fleeing the city. Also in Idlib, activists said members of a Syrian security agency killed more than a dozen detainees before withdrawing from a detention center in the city. The activists said the killings were conducted shortly before rebels took the so-called security compound in Idlib on Saturday. The Idlib Media Center showed a video of what it said were at least 12 bloodied bodies inside a room at the Military Intelligence Directorate. The Observatory said 15 men were found shot dead inside the compound. The group said 53 other detainees, including two women, were freed by the rebels in the compound. More than 220,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, which began with an Arab Spring uprising in March 2011 and turned into an insurgency following a brutal military crackdown.

Article text: (CNN)Comic books of the past few years have seen a lot of changes (a female Thor, anyone?) but not quite so many at one time. Three major characters -- Superman, Wonder Woman (both of DC Comics, a Time Warner company, like CNN) and Archie Andrews -- came out with new looks (and costumes in two cases) Thursday. Superman and Wonder Woman are no stranger to change over time, but these are pretty different from what we're used to. Wonder Woman is back to wearing pants (similar to her style circa 2010, not to mention a brief time in the 1970s) along with something of a turtleneck and body armor. Superman looks the most casual that we've ever seen him, simply in a t-shirt and jeans, and decidedly shorter hair. He also looks like someone you might not want to come across in a dark alley. As for Archie (who never really died, by the way), he's getting ready for his promised TV show by debuting a modern look -- one that makes it much easier to see why Betty and Veronica have been fighting for his affections all of these years. It's been a whirlwind time for comic book fans, and there will be a lot to get used to.

Article text: A desperate mother has to watch in horror as her daughter becomes paralysed every other day. Sarah Firth, 39, watches while her daughter is unable to move a single bone in her body for up to 19 hours at a time. In this state Ms Firth's daughter, Mia Park, can only cry out for help and wait until drugs help her regain movement. Mrs Firth said: 'When it happens, it is absolutely horrendous. My little girl goes from being an energetic youngster to being trapped in a body that can't move. 'It is awful to watch. She is so frightened. Her eyes are full of fear as she desperately waits to feel any form of sensation again.' Sarah Firth, 39, has to watch helplessly as her daughter, Mia Park, 12, becomes paralysed every other day to a rare genetic condition . Mia has hypokalemic periodic paralysis which means she has periods where she can't move her body and has to be rushed to hospital (pictured) Mia, who is just 12, suffered her first petrifying episode of paralysis in January this year. Ms Firth, a nurse, said : 'She had woken up in the night complaining she couldn't feel her arm. I just thought she had slept on it and it had gone numb. 'But by the morning, Mia said she couldn't feel her arms or legs. Initially I thought she was winding me up and trying to get the day off school because it was snowing. 'It was only when she couldn't sit up, or even move, that I realised she was telling the truth. 'I knew she hadn't had a stroke as her face wasn't sloping but I knew something very serious was wrong. 'I used a needle to prick her fingers and toes and she didn't flinch a single inch. I felt absolutely terrible for doubting her. She looked so scared. I could see she was desperately trying to move her arms and legs but couldn't. 'I immediately dialled the NHS helpline who sent for an ambulance. 'It was only as paramedics were carrying out an ECG and checking her blood pressure and airways that it struck me what was wrong. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood. The condition is caused by a mutation on chromosome 17. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an autosomal dominant disorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to you in order for you to be affected. Symptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement (paralysis) that come and go. There is normal muscle strength between attacks. Attacks usually begin in the teen years, but they can occur before age 10. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day. Others have them once a year. During attacks the person remains alert. The weakness or paralysis: . Other symptoms may include: . Source: US National Library of Medicine . 'My ex-husband, Mia's dad, and her grandad, also suffered from a condition that intermittently left them paralysed.' The extremely rare and potentially fatal condition, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, is caused by dangerously low levels of potassium. It took four paramedics to safely lift Mia, who had become a dead weight, onto a back board and into an ambulance. After initially being taken to Barnsley General District Hospital, she was rushed 20 miles to Sheffield Children's Hospital. It was there her potassium levels were checked and results showed they were extremely low and a neurologist, Dr Chris Rittey, diagnosed Mia with the debilitating condition. Mia was given potassium intravenously, but only after an agonising 14 hours, did she slowly regain movement. Ms Firth, a single mother, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire said: 'We were both just so relived. I never thought I'd be so happy to see Mia wriggle her fingers and toes. 'It is something you just take for granted, never imagining your child will literally freeze in her sleep, and lose sensation of almost every muscle from her neck down.' Over the following week, Mia fell into a state of paralysis every other day, each time it starting in her sleep. Ms Firth, 39, said: 'Every second morning she would wake up unable to move. Each time we were terrified. 'All we could do was wait for the IV potassium to flow through her body and pray it would take effect.' The condition, caused by mutation of chromosome 17, only effects one person in every 100,000 and is far more common in men than women. Ms Firth continued: 'That's why it never initially occurred to me that's what Mia had. Her dad had always told me it was a condition that affected males, not females, but obviously it does happen in girls too. 'Although Mia's attacks have slowed down to every couple of weeks at the moment, we have been warned the bouts of paralysis can happen at any time and could get more frequent. They generally happen when she is sleeping. 'If it happens when she is awake, Mia starts to slowly feel a tingling sensation in her fingers and she knows it's about to happen, and can take a form of potassium syrup to stop it developing. 'But when it starts in her sleep, she has no idea, and wakes up completely paralysed. 'It has had a devastating effect on our lives. I can't allow Mia to sleep over at friend's houses, something girls her age take for granted, or go on an overnight school trip without me in case she has an attack. 'As soon as it happens we have to get her straight to hospital in an ambulance so she can be treated immediately. If we don't we could lose Mia. Mia's attacks usually occur in her sleep, and she wakes up paralysed. Her mother must feed her, wash her and put a bed pan underneath her. In between attacks she can move normally . Mia was once paralysed for 19 hours. She finds relying on her mother difficult as she wants to be independent. She cannot stay at her friends houses in case she has an attack in her sleep . 'When it initially started I asked the consultant if it could be fatal, it broke my heart when he said yes. It's is horrendous to think I could lose my daughter. It's every parent's worst nightmare. 'It's very hard watching her go to sleep. I often check on her two or three times a night to see if she is moving. 'Every morning the first thing I do is check she can move hers arms and legs, only then do I breathe a sigh of relief. 'But of course there are times when she wakes up and is frozen to her bed. She is like a statue, completely still apart from her face.' The longest episode Mia has suffered has lasted 19 hours. Ms Firth said: 'During that time I have to feed her, wash her and put her on a bed pan. 'It's very frustrating for her. She's a young girl, just about to hit her teenage years and doesn't want to feel so out of control and dependant on me. 'She tries her best to put on a brave face but I know it's extremely hard for her. 'And because Mia is up and about a lot of the time and maintains a normal lifestyle as such, people do not realise how poorly she is and the severity of her illness. 'It can be a fatal if we don't act quickly.' Ms Firth and her daughter have no idea what the future holds and how much the condition will take over their lives. But they are taking each day as it comes and trying to remain positive. During an attack, Ms Firth is rushed to hospital where she is treated with potassium through an IV drip (she is pictured in hospital, left and right) Ms Firth added: 'We just have to take it in our stride and hope that we can manage the condition.' She is now fundraising for the Sheffield Children's Hospital Make It Better appeal, to build a new wing including plenty of private bedrooms so families can stay together at difficult times. When Mia was in hospital, Ms Firth kept vigil at her bedside, sleeping in a high-back chair. In the new wing, she would have her own pull-down bed, Mia would have more privacy, and would get better more quickly in a hospital designed with children in mind. David Vernon-Edwards, director at The Children's Hospital Charity, said: 'Mia is an inspirational girl, fighting a terrifying illness with such bravery. 'We are so lucky to have the specialist consultants at our hospital, such as Dr Rittey, who can help treat and control this condition. 'That is why we need to raise money for this appeal, to keep our specialist services special and bring world-class facilities to our already world-class hospital.'

Article text: Moscow (CNN)The primary suspect jailed in connection with the shooting death of Boris Nemtsov withdrew his confession Wednesday, saying he had been under duress during his admission and isn't guilty. Zaur Dadayev told two members of Russia's human rights council that he pleaded guilty after being detained because he was scared. He told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin he had been tortured and the well-being of his family and friends were threatened. Dadayev was one of two suspects recently charged in the case. Three other suspects have not been charged. Merkacheva and Babushkin were accused of "interfering" with the investigation and will be summoned for questioning over their motives, authorities said. Russia's Investigative Committee stated that the two rights activists violated the law when they visited and questioned Dadayev in a Moscow jail. Amnesty International condemned the Russian officials' decision to go after the activists, saying that a "threat to bring criminal charges" against the rights activists "raises alarming questions over the fairness of the investigation." Anton Tsvetkov, the head of the Public Chamber's commission for public security, said Dadyev and two other suspects denied being involved in the shooting of the Russian opposition leader. He said a doctor found no signs of torture during an examination of the three men. Shagit Gubashev and Anzor Gubashev had no bruises or wounds despite the fact they allege they were beaten by police, Tsvetkov said. Dadayev did have a cracked tooth and handcuff marks on his wrists. Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in February 27. The three suspects visited by Tsvetkov deny they are guilty and have appealed their arrests, he said. Putin has condemned Nemtsov's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate, the Kremlin has said. He also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice. CNN's Matthew Chance and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow, and Steve Almasy wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Elwyn Lopez and Karen Smith contributed to this report.

Article text: Two men who claimed to be drunk and high filmed themselves driving and shouting with a wounded owl in their car. Johnny Duverson and his cousin, who has not been named, filmed themselves waving a bottle and driving round the streets of West Palm Beach, Florida, with a Great Horned Owl in the front seat. Duverson's cousin holds the wide-eyed bird, which is protected by federal law, in the crook of his arm while Duverson whoops and cheers. Unexpected passenger: A video emerged showing the owl - which experts think is dazed - being held in the front seat of a car driving down a Florida highway . 'Drunk and high': This bottle - seemingly of alcohol - is waved around during the footage, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times . At one point in the video, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times, a voice is heard shouting: 'We chillin' with a owl [sic] right now, we vibin'' Alongside the video, Duverson wrote: '3am in the morning, we are drunk, we are high, we bout to take this thing home and eat it up just found it on the road.' Video: Johnny Duverson, pictured above, was in the car and posted the footage on his Facebook page . In a later post he said the bird was 'dancing' and 'acting crazy' during their 10-mile journey down the I-95 highway, which ended at Lake Worth. Wildlife experts were horrified at the video, and pointed out that possessing an owl in any capacity is a breach of federal wildlife laws. David Hitzig of the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary in Jupiter, Florida, said the owl looked as if it was dazed in the video. Speaking to the WPTV local news station, he said: 'To me the concern is: where is the owl now, what's happened to the owl, did anybody cause harm to the owl?' Duverson later said the owl was already hurt when they found it. When confronted by WPTV, he said: 'It didn't fly away so we knew it was hurt. Leave me alone.' He also seemed to row back on claims of the group being drunk and high whilst driving - though he did not offer an alternative explanation. DailyMail.com has attempted to contact Duverson. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation has also launched an investigation. Protected: Great Horned Owls - and any other type of owl - are protected by federal law, and cannot be owned .

The FA Chairman said the BBC has been placed in an impossible position and 'can't win either way' whatever the outcome of the Top Gear Inquiry. Clarkson, who is currently suspended after allegedly hitting Oisin Tymon in a row over hot food, has reportedly promised to sue the BBC if he is sacked from the popular show. Speaking to ITV News today, Mr Dyke said: 'First of all I'd say that I don't think Jeremy Clarkson is the first presenter I've met who would have liked to have thumped his producer. Scroll down for video . Former BBC boss Greg Dyke (right) has branded Jeremy Clarkson (left) a 'disaster waiting to happen' amid claims the presenter punched a Top Gear producer . 'But in truth he is a disaster waiting to happen really for the BBC. It's hard to…I'm glad I'm not the executive who has to take that decision because if you were, you can't win either way now.' The former BBC Director General added: 'Even if you decide to keep Jeremy…what happens next?' Clarkson allegedly believes that the BBC have launched a 'smear campaign' against him which he 'won't let go'. Sources close to the 54-year-old have said he is likely to take action against the Corporation for wrongful dismissal, if he is not reinstated to the programme. It comes amid reports that the BBC are filming a pilot of a new motoring show called The Getaway Car, which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges. Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas', prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air. The four Top Gear roadshows scheduled for Norway next weekend have been postponed. Tickets for the postponed shows cost between £42 and £100, meaning the decision could cost the BBC more than £1million in lost revenue if Clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled. Sacking Clarkson could mean the end of Top Gear, which makes the BBC millions every year . Speculation about his future has been mounting and will be decided this week when the corporation's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general. The BBC’s internal inquiry into Clarkson’s fracas with Mr Oisin is expected to made public as soon as Tuesday. It is being led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland who oversaw the investigation into the disastrous Newsnight edition that falsely accused the late Conservative peer Lord McAlpine of being involved in the north Wales child abuse scandal. The presenter launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala last week. Speaking at an event in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, Clarkson said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. He said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. 'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' But the under-fire presenter claimed that the 'sweary' incident had all been in good humour. Writing in his column in the Sunday Times, he said: 'I woke up after a night at a charity do to be told by my lawyer that someone had uploaded a video of me using choice language to describe bosses at the BBC. 'But it was all meant in jest and anyway it worked. By being brief, controversial and a bit sweary I woke the room up and the auction prize I was offering - one last lap of the Top Gear test track - raised £100,000.' Clarkson, pictured with co ho-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at a Top Gear Live show in Prague, will not be performing at the four events in Norway as they have been cancelled . Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . The Top Gear frontman revealed that he has been 'put on silence' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations. He said: 'I've been put on silence. There are very good reasons from my point of view why I simply can't say a word.' Insiders suggested Clarkson and Mr Tymon had given ‘quite different’ versions of events. Sources close to Mr Tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip, while Clarkson has admitted some ‘handbags and pushing’ but is understood to have denied anything worse. The BBC was given a reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank. The vehicle, apparently driven by the motoring show's enigmatic professional driver The Stig, made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street. Fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the Change.org petition, started by political website Guido Fawkes. There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear – worth £50million a year to BBC coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way . The petition, launched last week, reads: 'We the undersigned petition the BBC to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson. Freedom to fracas. #BringBackClarkson'.' It emerged yesterday that a report into Clarkson's behaviour was commissioned by BBC head of TV Danny Cohen after a series of other scandals last year. Top Gear caused an international incident after driving through Argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the Falklands War and used the word 'slope' describe an Asian man. A report into the cases apparently concluded that Top Gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show's team and the BBC's management to help deal with any future crisis. The BBC today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions. There is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take Top Gear – worth £50million a year to BBC coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way. ‘The programme could and should have carried on during Clarkson’s suspension,’ said an insider. ‘Jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings. ‘He has a great deal of public support... But he does need to rest and sort himself out.’ David Cameron's 11-year-old daughter Nancy has gone on hunger strike in protest at the presenter's suspension from Top Gear. She has threatened not to eat until the  presenter was restored to the BBC One show. Mr Cameron said: 'Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored. 'We told her that this is not necessarily a useful intervention - he’s not exactly Gandhi.'

Article text: Liverpool and Manchester United met on Sunday and renewed hostilities in English football's greatest rivalry, but 100 years ago they were making headlines for all the wrong reasons in a scandal that shocked the nation. The events ultimately cost one player his life and left another broken. It was Good Friday, April 4 1915 and Britain was at war. As the two sides met, Manchester United were struggling to avoid relegation, while Liverpool were in mid-table. In an oddly tame affair, George Anderson put United 1-0 up before Liverpool defender Bob Pursell conceded a penalty yet United's Patrick O'Connell missed by some distance. Anderson added a second before Liverpool forward Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar and was seemingly chastised by teammates for trying to score. Sandy Turnbull (second row, third from right) sits next to Enoch West and Arthur Whalley sits on the left of the front row (all three are circled) The sparse 18,000 Old Trafford crowd, sensing something was awry, jeered and booed, the match referee and local reporters noted Liverpool's lack of commitment. United manager John Robson is alleged to have left the stadium in disgust. 'The second half was crammed with lifeless football,' reported The Manchester Daily Dispatch. 'United were two up with 22 minutes to play and they seemed so content with their lead that they apparently never tried to increase it. Liverpool scarcely ever gave the impression that they would be likely to score.' A fortnight later, handbills were circulated alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of 7/1 on a 2–0 win to United. A suspiciously large number of bets had been made on that very scoreline causing odds to shorten to 4/1. The two points United won from the game were enough to earn them 18th place and safety. United with the three trophies they won in 1909. Turnbull is seated front right . The Sporting Chronicle published a notice from a bookmaker called 'Football King' who promised a substantial reward for information that would lead to punishment of the 'instigators of this reprehensible conspiracy'. It stated: 'We have solid grounds for believing that a certain First League match played in Manchester during Easter weekend was 'squared,' the home club being permitted to win by a certain score.' Mark Wylie, curator of the Manchester United museum, has been reflecting on the scandal this week as the 100th anniversary approaches with many questions still unanswered. 'Football was under intense scrutiny anyway, with it being wartime,' he said.' There had been so many complaints in the newspapers, in parliament, from the military, that professional football was being played while British soldiers, sailors and airmen were being killed, so the powers-that-be were anxious to see that football wasn't tarnished any further and they launched an investigation.' The Football League's lengthy delving found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match: Sandy Turnbull, Arthur Whalley and Enoch West of United, and Jackie Sheldon, Tom Miller, Bob Pursell and Thomas Fairfoul of Liverpool. United captain Charlie Roberts holding the FA Cup on the steps of Manchester Town Hall . They were accused of plotting the events during clandestine meetings at the Dog and Partridge pub in Stretford. Sheldon, a former United player, was found to be the plot's ringleader. Liverpool's Fred Pagnam and United's George Anderson had refused to take part; Pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result hence his teammates remonstrating with him when he hit the crossbar. He later testified against them and claimed Sheldon had offered him £3 in a taxi en route to the game. At the same hearing, United legend Billy Meredith denied any knowledge of the match-fixing, but said that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him. Manchester United 2 Liverpool 0 (April 2, 1915) Anderson (2) MANCHESTER UNITED: Beale; Hodge, Spratt, Montgomery, O'Connell, Haywood, Meredith, Potts,  Anderson, West, Norton. Manager: Jack Robson . LIVERPOOL: Scott; Longworth, Pursell, Fairfoul, Bratley, MacKinlay, Sheldon, Banks, Pagnam, Miller,  Nicholl. Manager: Tom Watson. Attendance: 18,000. On December 23, 1915, the seven were banned from playing for life. Stockport County's Lawrence Cook, a first class Lancashire cricketer, and Manchester City's Fred Howard were also suspended for their part in placing bets. A distraught West, the only United player to have appeared in the game, protested his innocence and sued the FA for libel. 'It wasn't a glorious episode,' says Wylie. 'Players could see that football was changing. With the sport under such scrutiny amid wartime, it was pretty obvious that football in 1915/16 would be very different, if it happened at all. Summer wages were being abolished, so once you got to the end of April there would be no wages until the end of August, and it was still unclear what would happen the following season. They could see their livelihood going. That was supposed to be encouragement for players to do things for the war effort.' By the time their bans were handed down, the Football League had suspended operations for the duration of the First World War. It was suggested that if the men joined the armed forces their punishment would be rescinded. All except West, signed up. For Turnbull it was to have tragic consequences. The death certificate of Sandy Turnbull (right), featuring the memorial at Arras in France . A forward of great repute, Turnbull was a Boys' Own character who had joined United from Manchester City with Meredith. The fiesty Scot, pioneered the first footballers union and his 1909 FA Cup final winning goal prompted United's owners to build Old Trafford to herald a new dawn. Fittingly, Turnbull, who lived in Maine Road, scored United's first goal at the Theatre of Dreams. Yet following the betting scandal and facing a life without football, Turnbull went to war. Sadly, on May 3 1917, at the age of 33, Lance Sergeant Sandy Turnbull was killed during a muddled, unsuccessful night attack on German lines just east of Arras, France. His body was never found. He left a widow, Florence, and four young children. The FA gave him a posthumous reinstatement. All the other players, except West, had their bans lifted by the FA in 1919 in recognition of their service to the country. West, who had been good friends with Turnbull, had continued to fight a different battle, one to clear his name. In February 1916, when United and Liverpool played in a regional match, he took to standing outside Old Trafford handing out handbills: '£50 reward. To all whom it may concern: I, Enoch James West (late Manchester United), offer the above sum to be given to any Red Cross Fund if any person or persons can prove that I bet or won any money in any way over the match at Old Trafford, Manchester United v. Liverpool, on Good Friday, 1915, the said match over which I got suspended. (Signed) Enoch James West, 68 Railway Road, Old Trafford. West twice unsuccessfully attempted to sue the FA for libel and in 1918 was caught and banned again for playing under an assumed name for a club in Ireland. He was eventually pardoned under a general amnesty in 1945, by which time he was aged 59. He had served the longest ban in football and maintained his innocence until his death in 1965. His family carried on his fight. A book entitled 'Free the Manchester United One' by Graham Sharpe pleaded Enoch's case. On publishing, Sharpe said: 'I am confident that at the very least, I have established that there is little or no genuine evidence which can be interpreted as conclusive proof of the guilt of Enoch West as he was charged.' West's great grandson, Graham West, said: 'I would just like to set the record straight, Enoch 'Knocker' West was wrongly accused of match fixing and he protested his innocence till his death bed. Having been accused of this, it broke his heart, all he lived for was football. He died a broken man thanks to these accusations that were never proved.' Sadly, the full truth may now never be known. The Liverpool Daily Post reported: 'A more one-sided first half would be hard to witness.' The . Sporting Chronicle wrote 'The Liverpool forwards gave the weakest . exhibition in this half [the second] seen on the ground during the . season.'

Article text: The happiest year of our life begins when we turn 34 because it's when we start ticking off boxes such as tying the knot, having children and making strides in a chosen career, according to a survey. A study of 2,000 over-40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and compiled the key factors for each decade. Results showed age 34 was the happiest year for most people on average. A study of 2,000 over-40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and found 34 was the age when people were at their happiest in every aspect of their lives . The study also found it is the age when we are most comfortable in ourselves, earn enough money to get on the property ladder, meet monthly payments with confidence and start to enjoy the finer things in life. Meanwhile, those who thought their 20s were the happiest cited the freedom, social life and career progression they enjoyed in that decade. Those who chose a year in their 40s as their happiest enjoyed watching the children grow up and getting a bigger home, the study by home security specialists Yale found. People who chose their 50s said work winding down, the children leaving home, paying off the mortgage and getting a new start after a divorce as their happy factors. Getting on the property ladder was a recurring theme throughout the study and the age a person gets their first home often correlated with their happiest year . 1. I was young and physically fit . 2. I had less responsibility/more freedom . 3. I was comfortable with my appearance . 4. I got married . 5. My family were still around . 6. All my money was spent on myself . 7. I met someone I fell in love with . 8. I had children . 9. I had a wider social circle . 10. I partied a lot . 11. I travelled a lot . 12. I had flings/went on dates/played the field . 1. I had children . 2. I met someone I fell in love with . 3. I was able to enjoy the finer things in life . 4. I travelled . 5. I started making the right decisions . 6. I was making more money than I ever had . 7. I got married . 8. Had a great holiday abroad . 9. I got a great new job/made a career change . 10. Finally got on the property ladder . 11. I moved abroad . 12. My family members got married . The study also found those choosing a year in their 60s as their happiest year so far said the ability to retire, travel more and finally relax as crucial boosts to a positive outlook. A key reason behind being most happy included 'meeting someone I fell in love with' which appeared in the happy moments for 20s, 30s and 40s, while 'getting married' appears in every decade. People were most likely to state that they had become happier as they had grown older rather than the other way round, results showed. 1. I was comfortable financially and emotionally . 2. Work was winding down . 3. Pay off the mortgage . 4. I went travelling . 5. I became a grandparent . 6. Children moved out . 7. Got divorced, started fresh . 8. Got married or re-married . 9. I was at the top of my game career-wise . 10. I got over an illness/condition . 11. Had a big wedding anniversary . 12. Lost weight/got fit . 13. Children moved out . 14. Renewed vows . 1. Felt comfortable with myself . 2. Had a great family life . 3. Met someone I fell in love with . 4. Had a great time with my children/ children were growing up . 5. Got some 'me time' back . 6. I was very successful . 7. I had a lot of money put away . 8. Got married . 9. Got a divorce, started over . 10. Changed career . 11. Lost weight/got fit . 12. Moved into a bigger home . 13. Children moved out . 14. Became stay-at-home . People cited having children and grandchildren as one of their 'happy factors' throughout each decade . Overall people reflected on their lives happily, with 47 per cent able to say most of their life had been happy so far. And 43 per cent said their life had been an equal balance of happy and rougher times, while one in ten unfortunately looked back on their life as mostly unhappy. Nigel Fisher, MD of home security Yale, said: 'With the average age we're most happiest coming out in the mid-thirties, it suggests that the feeling of being settled in your work and personal life while still looking to the future is important. 'Getting on the property ladder was a recurring theme throughout the study and the age a person gets their first home often correlated with the happiest year they chose. 'That sense of a permanent home and place to create new and happy memories is a big part of the study and shows the importance of a secure home environment in making us content with life.' 1. Finally retired . 2. Was able to travel . 3. Could concentrate on hobbies and interests . 4. Had freedom from work . 5. I started to appreciate life . 6. I was able to relax for the first time . 7. Could finally concentrate on myself . 8. Became a grandparent . 9. Got fit and healthy . 10. Got married . Holly Willoughby . Katherine Jenkins . Kim Kardashian West . Paris Hilton . Ryan Gosling .
