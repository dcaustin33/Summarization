Article text: Many of us pass urine without thinking – or looking – at the colour of it. But perhaps it’s time to take note, because our pee can say a lot about our health, according to one doctor. Speaking on ITV’s This Morning, Dr Chris Steele explained what each shade of pee – from clear to red to green and blue – tells us about the body. He lined up test tubes of a range of colours of urine, from clear through to dark yellow, to red and blue. His first piece of advice is to look at the colour of urine while peeing, rather than when it has hit the toilet bowl. Scroll down for video . Dr Chris Steele, a GP and resident doctor on ITV's This Morning, said people should look at the colour of their urine while they are peeing, not when the urine has hit the bowl and is diluted in water . Red and dark red urine (pictured) could be caused by certain foods like beetroot or drugs like laxatives. However, it could be due to blood in the urine, signalling an infection, or tumours or kidney stones . He told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'You should look at the colour in the stream that you’re passing, not when it’s in the toilet bowl, because it gets diluted in two litres of water.’ When asked if this would be a bit difficult for women, he replied: ‘You can even catch it if you’re worried.’ And when thinking about the colour of our pee, it's important to remember how food, drink and medication could be affecting it, he added. He said: ‘Laxatives can cause a darkening colour of the urine. Always think about what you’re putting in your mouth, could that be affecting things?’ An example of this is asparagus and food colourants that can turn the urine blue or green. Meanwhile, urine that is frothy and foamy could be a warning sign someone is eating too much protein and needs to cut back, he said. ‘It could be due to protein. Maybe you’re on a high protein diet. Or it could be due to infection.' Next, he explained what each shade of pee means, in terms of health. Clear urine could be a sign of a ‘good hydrated person’, Dr Steele said. However, it could be because they are taking diuretic medicine which is making them pass water frequently. The diagram, created by the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, shows that urine should be straw coloured or pale yellow. If it is darker, it suggests the person is dehydrated . He added: ‘They might be drinking diuretic-type drinks, such as coffee and alcohol. They can cause this effect.’ He explained that the kidneys have two main functions: the first being to filter out toxins, create waste matter, and get it out of the body. The second is to balance fluid in the body; the fluid gained from drinks and metabolic reactions in the body, and the fluids lost through sweat. A deep yellow coloured urine means the person is more dehydrated. He said: ‘In the morning you might notice your urine is darker coloured than in the evening. 'This is because in the night you’ve just been laying there doing nothing and your kidneys have been working concentrating the toxic effects. If a person's urine is brown, it could be a sign of liver disease. If it is red, it could contain blood . Orange urine is normally a sign of dehydration, but could be a liver or bile duct disorder. Blue or green urine is normally due to food dye or medication . ‘Deep yellow urine could be a sign of liver problems which cause jaundice of the skin, eyes, and the urine to become more yellow.’ But the most important colour to look out for is a pink or light red colour. If a person has red-coloured urine, it could be because they ate certain foods the night before. Dr Steele said: ‘Beetroot, blackberries, blackcurrants even rhubarb [are all common culprits]. Food colourants are powerful and can get through the kidneys.’ However, it could be a more serious sign of infection from the kidney travelling down through the bladder and urethra. It could also be due to a tumour, or kidney stones. ‘But the commonest reasons for red urine is cystitis - or urinary tract infections,’ Dr Steele said. ‘This causes excess blood to come out into the urine.’ A person with dark red urine is deeply dehydrated, he warned. ‘We’re talking about patients with liver disease,' he explained. Foaming or fizzing urine is usually a sign of too much protein in the diet, or a kidney problem .

Check the colour mid-stream, rather than when the pee has hit the bowl .
Clear urine means a person is hydrated - or has had too much coffee .
Darker urine could be a sign of jaundice caused by liver disease .
Red pee may be due to food dye, or  a sign of an infection like cystitis .

Article text: Stuart McCall admits taking on the challenge of steering Rangers to Premiership promotion was a gamble he couldn’t refuse as he bids to earn a longer stay as Ibrox boss. The 50-year-old was unveiled on Thursday as manager until the end of the current season – following the exit of caretaker Kenny McDowall - and hasn’t received any promises about what could lie beyond that point. However, the former Rangers midfielder insists he didn’t think twice about returning to the club where he won six league titles in seven years during the 1990s. New Rangers manager Stuart McCall raises the club scarf after being unveiled on Thursday afternoon . McCall, 50, will take charge of the club he used to play for until the end of the season . The new Rangers boss takes his first training session at Murray Park on Thursday afternoon . McCall views it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and is focused on revitalising a play-off push that could convince the new Rangers board he is the man for the future. ‘I know what the expectation levels are at this club,’ he said. ‘It’s a gamble, it’s a massive challenge but it’s an opportunity I never thought I’d get and I had to take it. ‘It’s an honour and a privilege to be asked to come and help out at this club until the end of the season. ‘People have been texting me good luck and asking me if I know what I’m doing. But it’s a wonderful opportunity for me.’ McCall addressed the players and conducted an afternoon training session at Murray Park after cancelling their scheduled day off. He spoke with director John Gilligan and interim chairman Paul Murray to reach an agreement on Wednesday but confirmed no guarantees were given beyond the 11 remaining games of the regular season. The former Motherwell manager has taken charge of the Ibrox club for the rest of the season . The former Bradford player faces the press as he is unveiled on Thursday . McCall said the chance to manage Rangers for just 11 guaranteed games was a 'wonderful opportunity' ‘There’s nothing concrete,’ said the former Motherwell boss, who will again be assisted by Kenny Black. ‘My question to the board was: “What do you see as success?” ‘I don’t want to do as well as I can, turn it around, and then see others coming in. ‘Progress will obviously be an upturn in results and everyone will say success is gaining promotion to the Premiership. But you could get to the second leg of the play-off final, see your goalkeeper sent off and lose on penalty kicks. ‘It can be a thin line between whether you go up or not. We’ve got to improve our performance and it’s about self-belief and regaining confidence. There are no guarantees either way if we go up or have to stay down. ‘I want to make it a success. I’m not an over-confident person. I know it will be a struggle but I will do my best.’ Rangers announced that caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has left the club ahead of a new appointmnet . McCall (centre right) celebrates the 1992 SPL during his Rangers playing days with the Ibrox club . McCall also confirmed he would not have taken the job had Dave King and his allies not attained boardroom power. ‘I get paid to try and get the best out of a group of players,’ he added. ‘There is no magic formula or a pill you can give them for confidence. It’s about trying to restore self-belief. A couple of results can change things. ‘The supporters are there, willing them to do well. They don’t want to come and boo. The club has had a kicking, but the team have had two promotions in the past two seasons and there is still an opportunity to get another one this year.’ McCall spoke at length with McDowall on Thursday morning, before the latter’s amicable departure was then confirmed later in the day. McDowall was a reluctant leader at Rangers and was boss for 10 games, winning just three of those . Stuart McCall (left), who was Scotland assistant under Gordon Strachan, has taken charge at Ibrox . McDowall became caretaker manager after Ally McCoist was placed on garden leave by the old regime just before Christmas. He was, however, always a reluctant conscript to the role and had handed in his own notice in January. ‘It was an honour and privilege to work for Rangers Football Club and I will leave with so many positive memories,’ said McDowall, who originally arrived at Ibrox as first-team coach in 2007. ‘I have worked with so many talented people since I joined and I will forever be in Walter Smith’s debt for bringing me to Rangers. ‘Working with Walter, Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Jim Stewart and all the backroom staff plus the staff at Ibrox and Murray Park was a pleasure and I wish the club well for the future. ‘I was delighted to play a part in the club’s history and I wish the supporters and new management team all the very best.’

Article text: Chinese officials have taken an unusual step in the fight against scrap metal thieves by starting to fit their manholes with GPS tracking devices. Councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high-tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old, low-tech versions, according to the People's Daily Online. The seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red-faced, turning for sale in various places around the world. High tech: The new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves . Problem: More than 240,000 manholes were stolen in Beijing over a 10 year period, thanks to metal values . The chains also proved unpopular, with many pointing out they could easily be cut, and were dangerous for people walking along the street. One man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face, thanks to the chain. It is hoped these new covers, which were developed by a Chinese tech company, will not only put would-be thieves off stealing the items, but also help track those who do give into temptation. The covers, along with drain grills, can fetch high prices on the black market, as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years. It has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone. Measures: Previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked . The new covers, designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features, are made out of a metal with a far lower value, as a further deterrent. A test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of Hangzhou this month,  and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city. But it is not just about the money. Officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well, as people could trip on an upturned manhole. Tao Xiaomin, of Hangzhou urban management office, explained: 'When a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees, the tag will send an alarm signal to us.'

Article text: Martin Guptill became the first man to score a double hundred in a Cricket World Cup knockout match and propelled co-hosts New Zealand into the semi-finals as they claimed a 143-run win against West Indies. The 28-year-old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 from 163 balls - including 24 fours and 11 sixes, one of which found the roof of Wellington's Westpac Stadium in the final over. The record-breaking innings, which was the second highest one day international score of all time behind Indian Rohit Sharma's 264, helped New Zealand to 393 for six.

In reply, West Indies were all out for 250 in 30.3 overs, with Trent Boult claiming four for 44 to become the leading wicket taker in the tournament. New Zealand will face South Africa in the semi-finals while Australia play India in the other match. It could have been so different, though, had Marlon Samuels held a the catch just three balls in which would have sent Guptill back to the pavilion. Guptill also survived two lbw shouts, but New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum had less luck at the other end as he fell for 12 runs. Kane Williamson had put on 33 before falling to Andre Russell, whose wide delivery ended up with Chris Gayle at short cover. Meanwhile Guptill was moving towards his half-century and reached it with a single from the last ball of the 20th over to put New Zealand on 105 for two. His ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted Darren Sammy to wide long-on. Guptill was perhaps guilty of ball-watching when Ross Taylor was run out for 42 but, despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics, he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in ODIs with a single off Sulieman Benn. Corey Anderson was then caught by an off-pace delivery from Russell, shuffling across to pull the ball across to Gayle at midwicket for 15. Guptill's double-ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it, achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off Russell before partner Grant Elliott was dismissed on review. Guptill ignored that disappointment to fire a four that brought him to 199, going on to drill Russell's first delivery of the 48th over to long-off for a four that made World Cup history.

Article text: Rescue centers are struggling to cope with a mystery surge in the numbers of starving sea lion pups which have washed up on Californian shores since January. More than 1,100 starving and sick pups have been rescued from California's beaches, as well as public bathrooms, behind buildings and along railroad tracks since the beginning of the year. The number is almost five times higher than the 250 pups which would usually be expected in the key monitoring period between January and April - and no one knows why. Scroll down for video . Crisis: More than 1,100 sick or starving sea lion pups have washed up on Californian shores this year . Surge: Rescuers usually only expect to see about 250 in the same period, and so volunteers like BrennanSlavik (pictured) have been helping save the pups, like this one on Laguna Beach . Rescue: At SeaWorld, in San Diego, the sea lion show has been suspended and two temporary pools have been dedicated to housing pups like this one, in the hope they can be saved . It's not unusual to have some sea lions wash up each spring as the pups leave their mothers, but Keith A. Matassa, executive director at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, said they started getting calls in December. His center, in Laguna Beach, is currently rehabilitating 115 sea lion pups. On a recent day, over the course of two hours, five suffering animals came in. One was brought in by a police officer, three more came in with an animal control team and the fifth was called in by a couple walking along beach. The last pup, at almost a year old, weighed just 23 pounds - a third of what it should have. It was so ill, staff had no choice but to put it down. Matassa explained pups that should be gaining 20 to 40 pounds in a two-month period have put on just two pounds. 'These animals are coming in really desperate. They're at the end of life. They're in a crisis ... and not all animals are going to make it,' he said. Feeding: Once rescued, pups who are healthy enough to be saved are fed formula to help them put on weight . Volunteer: Brennan Slavik carries a just-rescued sea lion pup into a holding pen after feeding it . Surgery: Dr Todd Schmitt, center, and veterinarian technician Jen Rego, right, prepare an injured sea lion for eye surgery at SeaWorld's Animal Rescue Center, in San Diego . An hour down the coast, the situation is so bad that SeaWorld, in San Diego, suspended its sea lion show so it can focus on rescue efforts. The theme park has treated 400 pups - more than twice the number it would care for in a typical year - and constructed two temporary pools to house them. Scientists aren't sure what's causing the crisis, but suspect that warmer waters from this winter's mild El Nino weather pattern are impacting the sea lion birthing grounds along the Channel Islands off the Southern California coast. The warm water is likely pushing prime sea lion foods - market squid, sardines and anchovies - further north, forcing the mothers to abandon their pups for up to eight days at a time in search of sustenance. Dying: A starving pup, weighing a third of what it should have done, looks out from a playpen at the Pacific Mammal Center. It later had to be put down, so weak it could not be saved . Stronger: Once pups get stronger, they graduate from formula to whole fish, and are playfully called 'feeders' while those that can once more compete for fish tossed into a pool are called 'fighters.' Washed up: Pups have been found in public washrooms, behind buildings and on railway tracks . The pups, scientists believe, are weaning themselves early out of desperation and setting out on their own despite being underweight and ill-prepared to hunt. 'They're leaving with a very low tank of gas and when they get over here, they're showing up on the beach basically ... starving to death,' said Justin Viezbicke, a coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's California Stranding Network. For rescue centers like Pacific Marine Mammal, that translates into round-the-clock, back-breaking work for dozens of volunteers who've arrived from all over the U.S. to help. The center in one of Southern California's premiere beach communities has rescued more than 213 pups since the beginning of the year and has treated ones that weighed as little as 14 pounds at eight-months-old. Volunteers have been arriving from all over the U.S. to help with the escalating crisis. Crates holding animals awaiting assessment are crammed into every corner, including the laundry room, as those already housed in communal pens barked and bleated in a deafening racket as mealtime approached. Warming: The surge could be down to rising sea temperatures, pushing the sea lion's normal food north . Listed: The names of the rescued sea lion pups at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center . Overwhelmed: The Pacific Marine Mammal Center currently has 115 sea lion pups - far more than usual . Release: They hope to get them healthy enough to set free, tracking some to monitor their progress . Each incoming pup has its temperature taken and is weighed, measured and given a blood sugar test before the team decides if they can save it. Most of them are so weak they barely resist. Those that make the cut are tube-fed a gruel of pureed herring, Pedialyte, vitamins and milk three or four times a day after starting out with a simple broth of hydrating fluids and dextrose. Those that graduate to whole fish are playfully called 'feeders' and those that can once more compete for fish tossed into a pool are called 'fighters.' The goal is to get the pups strong enough to swim free again - but the volunteers who nurse them back to health may never know if they make it in the wild. Only a handful will be fitted with expensive tracking devices. The rest are tagged with a number and fall off the radar unless they are rescued again. 'The tricky part is we're putting them back into the same environment that they just came from. And that's going to be a challenge for them,' Viezbicke said.

Article text: Police have appealed for help from the public to identify a man who was pulled near death from a shark-infested harbour by two teenage girls. The pair have been hailed as heroes after risking their own lives to jump into shark-infested waters where a man was drowning. Cousins Kelly McKay, 15, and Payge Olds, 16, were helping their friend tow his car near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night when they heard a man scream for help. Without thinking, the group rushed 300m down the beach to the scene where Payge managed to undress the fastest and swim 70 metres out to sea to rescue the  man. Cousins Kelly McKay, 15 (left), and Payge Olds, 16 (right) risked their own lives on Monday night when they saved a drowning man in Wellington Harbour . 'We all thought it was a prank at first because this kind of thing doesn't really happen,' Payge, from Lower Hutt in Wellington told Daily Mail Australia. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek,  who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it. He saw the man floating face down in the water unconscious. Mr Derek, who was unable to swim, alerted the group to the man in the water, with the hope that one of them would be a capable swimmer. 'I was the last one there and everyone else was undressed and ready to jump in the water but no one had jumped in yet because none of them are comfortable swimmers so I ended up just stripping off to my underwear and then jumping in,' Payge said. The two teenagers were helping their friend tow his car after it got stuck on the beach . The incident happened near Burdan's Gate in Eastbourne, Wellington Harbour, at 10:30pm on Monday night . Payge said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her. 'I wasn't expecting to get that far,' she said of the distance she swam out to sea. 'At the time I didn't really think about it. I just thought you know what there's a man out there suffering, I need to get to him and help him. 'Now I'm really proud of myself and I'm happy that I was there.' Police released images of the man unconscious and lying in his hospital bed an appealed for public help to identify him . The man appeared to be aged in his 30s and from a South Asian background . Police said the man was dressed but had no identificatoin on him, The Dominion Post reported. 'Unfortunately, due to his condition, police has been unable to speak with him and he was not carrying any identification that could help us find out who he is,' Detective Sergeant Grant Corroll said, appealing for anyone who recognises him to contact police. 'Given his critical stauts, time is of the essence,' he said. Even the murky water and it's inhabitants didn't stop the courageous teenager from jumping head-first into the harbour. Payge (right) said she is not a confident swimmer and didn't think about the shark-infested waters when she leaped into the harbour but she knew that the man's life depended on her . 'There's eels and multiple other things in there,' she said. 'Sometimes we do get sharks and whales  and stingrays but I didn't really think about that. Well I did but I tried to avoid that thought.' Two men, who were sitting on the rocks on the harbours edge, shone torches on the water so Payge would be able to see where she was going. The teenager said she was terrified she would be too late and that she would lose the man in the dark. 'My worst fear was that he wasn't there any more and that I was just too late,' she said. The man's cries for help were also heard by a fisherman, John Derek, who had been fishing earlier in the evening and returned as he realised that he had dropped his cell phone and went back to find it . 'Eventually I came across him and he was kind of floating. He was sinking but he was just on the surface. 'If I has been any longer I would have completely lost him and I would not have been able to find him.' According to Payge, the man had an Indian appearance and weighed between 70 and 80kg.

Article text: This star is fading, just that little bit too soon. After Steven Gerrard announced in January his decision to leave Liverpool for LA Galaxy in the summer, many were anticipating one last hurrah in a red shirt, given so many had come before. ‘I want to make sure that I have no regrets when my playing career is eventually over,’ he said back then, less than three months ago. Eighty days, in fact. Plunging his studs into Ander Herrera’s ankle in a vital match against bitter rivals Manchester United, one of the most tantalising games on the fixture list, was surely not what he had in mind. Especially as defeat has left them five points adrift of United in fourth. Steven Gerrard is shown a straight red card against Manchester United after being on the pitch for 38seconds . Gerrard makes the long walk back to the dressing room after being sent off against Manchester United . When a 19-year-old Gerrard picked up the ball 40 yards from goal, waltzed past two Sheffield Wednesday players before finding the bottom left corner with a right-footed drive for his first ever Liverpool strike, his team-mates mobbed him. The boy who had joined the club aged eight had become a man. A star was born. That strike had provided a two-goal cushion when a makeshift Liverpool side - hit by injuries - was struggling against bottom-of-the-table Wednesday in 1999. A bright, twinkling career was beckoning; one in which his passion, guile and leadership would shine fiercely throughout. He would lead the team by example many, many more times. To not even be considered as a regular starter, to reduce his own swan-song by three games due to a moment of madness, is not how he would have imagined it ending 16 years later. Steven Gerrard celebrates at the end of the game after scoring against Sheffield Wednesday in 1999 . Or that he was not at the heart of their 13-game unbeaten run in the Premier League which was driving the team towards a Champions League spot. That he would start just five of those and then be so largely to blame for their capitulation in the 14th. The infamous slip last season against Chelsea, which many credit for ending Liverpool’s title chances, could have been buried beneath all the trophies and silverware. But too many crucial mistakes and they begin to stand out more prominently. It is not the first time Gerrard has been sent off against Manchester United - he saw red in 2011 . Gerrard has been sent off six times in his Liverpool career - seen here against Leeds, Everton and Chelsea . This is not the goodbye he would’ve wanted, or the one he deserves after being the catalyst of a team hanging to the coattails of the league’s best for over a decade to a Champions League, two FA Cups, three League Cups and the UEFA Cup. His greatness will never be forgotten, but neither will these high-profile errors at the end if they keep occurring. Gerrard has picked up six Premier League red cards now, often a byproduct of leaders when their passion spills over. Only seven players have received more, including Roy Keane with seven and Patrick Vieira with eight. But the big occasions are when these types of explosive players are supposed to be able to keep it under control. Gerrard has been Liverpool's inspirational leader for over a decade . Gerrard will be best remembered for leading Liverpool to a number of trophies - including the FA Cup and Champions League . There is still the hope of an FA Cup final at Wembley to celebrate his 35th birthday on Saturday, May 30. But due to his ban he will not even be in the side to help them reach it in their FA Cup replay against Blackburn. Nor for their next, crucial, Premier League match against Champions League rivals Arsenal or the game versus Newcastle. As it stands there are six games remaining of Liverpool’s season and Gerrard’s Merseyside career. If they progress to the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa in his absence, that will be seven, and eight if they make it to the final. Given all that has gone before, how much he will be desperate to go out on a high before he crosses the Atlantic. But will Brendan Rodgers trust him again? Or has this star been snuffed out too soon?

Article text: Omaha, Nebraska (the Heartland Project)When Ryan Sallans, an activist in the Nebraska transgender community, first went to the doctor in 2005 to talk about what he medically needed to do for his gender transition, his doctor wanted to offer medical help. That was the good news. The disconcerting news was the doctor had to Google the issue first to figure out the best medical advice. "My provider just did a Web search to figure out what dose of hormones I should be on, and put me on the highest dose," Sallans said.  That could have been a dangerous choice. "Starting too high of a dose too quickly can cause a lot of health problems, particularly to cardiovascular health." Fortunately, Sallans didn't have any health complications. But his experience left him with a mission. He volunteers to speak with medical institutions, as well as with businesses and colleges, to urge them to be more LGBT inclusive. While a growing number of medical schools are teaching future doctors how to address health concerns that can be specific to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, studies show current doctors only get about five hours of training, if they get any at all. The transgender life: What to know, say and understand . For members of the LGBT community who live in more rural and conservative areas like Nebraska, the struggle to get good, or at least up-to-date, medical care may be even more difficult. In general, legal protections and institutional supports for LGBT Nebraskans are already thin, spotty or nonexistent. On March 2, the United States District Court struck down Nebraska's ban on marriage for same-sex couples, but that ruling is on appeal. Then there were 12: Nebraska ordered to end same-sex marriage ban . Without the legal institution of marriage, LGBT Nebraskans typically lack family health benefits, unless their employers provide them to same-sex partners. A 2014 study from the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles found that states without LGBT legal protections in place see lower rates of health insurance coverage for LGBT residents than states with protections. That plays out in Nebraska. A 2014 study from researchers at the University of Nebraska Omaha found that LGBT residents in the rural parts of the state have lower rates of health insurance coverage than their counterparts in urban areas. Time to close HIV's racial disparities . Even when LGBT Nebraskans have health insurance, they struggle to find providers versed in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender heath care needs. Research shows that LGBT individuals often experience health issues linked to being regular targets of discrimination or social stigma. Discrimination has been linked to higher rates of substance abuse, suicide and stress-related illnesses, which can include heart problems, obesity, eating disorders and cancer. If the available doctors are not familiar with the increased rates of these issues, they may provide inadequate care. Patients who find their doctors do not understand their issues may also delay treatment, often with bad health outcomes, said Jay Irwin, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and a researcher in LGBT health. Sometimes patients are turned away by providers who don't want to treat LGBT patients, particularly if there are no laws to prohibit such discrimination. Irwin has completed studies that focus on the health care challenges of lesbians in rural areas and found that many people feel isolated and are afraid to come out -- or risk discrimination in the medical office. Supreme Court same sex marriage decision could impact election . Nebraska's sheer size doesn't help. Sixteenth largest in the nation by geography, members of its LGBT community often live far from large cities with significant LGBT populations and with teaching hospitals with staff members who have experience working with members of that community. The Human Rights Campaign's 2014 Healthcare Equality Index named four Nebraska health care facilities, all in Omaha, as leaders in LGBT health care equality. Omaha is on the state's eastern border with Iowa. LGBT residents in western Nebraska -- for instance, places like North Platte -- have to travel 270 miles in either direction, to Omaha or Denver, Colorado, to reach facilities designated as leaders by the Human Rights Campaign. People who work within the health care system have seen some improvement when it comes to treating members of the LGBT community. Jill Young is the client services manager at Nebraska AIDS Project's Scottsbluff, Nebraska, office in the western part of the state. She recalled when she started working there in the late 1990s she saw medical staff refuse care to LGBT people with HIV/AIDS. HIV deaths among African-Americans drop 18%, CDC says . "We had nurses, for example, who said they wouldn't serve patients with HIV/AIDS," Young said. "But we've come a long way since then." Young has seen more hospitals in the region adopting policies that are supportive of LGBT residents, including one that just started recognizing same-sex partners' wills as legal documents that will allow them access to their partners when they are being cared for in areas restricted to immediate family only. But she said she still sees too many LGBT residents traveling great distances to get care and she still sees too many patients who don't seek medical care until it is too late. "We still go to the hospital," she said, "and see people who are days away from dying." Eric Yarwood, 44, has more experience than he would like with Nebraska's health care facilities. He spent over 100 days last year at hospitals in Omaha for complications related to germ cell cancer. He had nine rounds of chemotherapy, three stem cell transplants, his third surgery two weeks ago and five more days for followup last week. For all but four of the days he was in the hospital, his partner, Aaron Persen, 36, was at his side every evening. "Aaron and I are a unit," Yarwood said. "I can count on my fingers the number of times he didn't come." While the couple has found the overwhelming majority of physicians and medical staff to be "genuinely supportive" of their relationship,  there still were a few instances when they felt uncomfortable and unaccepted, once with a physician and another time with a nurse. "I'm not sure how often the medical staff works with gay couples or receives training on how to work with gay couples," Yarwood said. Same-sex marriage fast facts . Yarwood's prognosis is good, and the couple looks with optimism to a future of having more access to LGBT-inclusive health care facilities and a more inclusive state overall. "Hopefully, by the time we get through the cancer and save a little money," Persen said, "Nebraska will follow most other states and allow our relationship to be legally recognized."

Article text: A former equality chief has branded his years working to stamp out racial discrimination as 'utterly wrong'. Writer and broadcaster Trevor Phillips said efforts made under the Blair government turned anti-racism into an 'ugly new doctrine'. Mr Phillips is the former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and has waged a 30-year campaign to tackle issues around discrimination and equality. In an upcoming Channel 4 documentary, called Things We Won't Say About Race That Are True, he says attempts to stop prejudice instead encouraged abuse and endangered lives as well as contributed to the rise of parties like Ukip. Trevor Phillips, who was the head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said efforts made under the Blair government to end racial discrimination were 'wrong' In the 75-minute documentary, he delves into Britain's racial tensions and stereotypes as well as hostilities towards immigrants. He explains: 'It was my job to to make sure that different racial and religious groups got on. 'Campaigners like me seriously believed that if we could prevent people expressing prejudiced ideas then eventually they would stop thinking them. 'But now I'm convinced we were utterly wrong.' Mr Phillips, a Labour party member, says anti-racism began with good intentions but turned into 'thought control'. He says the London 2005 bombing by British Muslims, forced him to do rethink his views. Now, he insists that only a willingness to talk more openly about race, despite risk of causing offence, will help those in need. Mr Phillips interviews Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left) and former prime minister Tony Blair (right) for the documentary, which airs March 19 . In the documentary, which airs on March 19, Mr Phillips asks Nigel Farage whether attempts to embrace diversity have led to the rise of Ukip. He also also talks to Tony Blair about how the work begun by New Labour in support of diversity and equality can be revived. Former England footballer Les Ferdinand will also feature in the documentary to highlight racial issues in the sport. And former home secretary Jack Straw, who is also interviewed, tells Mr Phillips that many MPs are wary of expressing their views for fear of being branded racist. But Mr Phillips insists people should be free to use racial stereotypes, such as that many Jews are rich or that black people are more likely to be convicted for robbery, because they are true. Explaining the issue, he said: 'The dividing lines of race, religion and culture are probably the most dangerous flashpoints in Britain today, but they're also the ones we find hardest to talk about in public. Former footballer Les Ferdinand, who is now Director of Football at Queens Park Rangers, will also feature on the programme, to discuss racial issues in the sport . 'This film points to ways in which we can say what's on our minds without being accused of being bigots.' Channel 4 head of specialist factual David Glover, who commissioned the documentary, said: 'This film contains some very uncomfortable facts about race. 'Trevor Phillips now strongly believes that it's important to get them out there, so ultimately we can understand and tackle them. 'Trevor is arguably the best-qualified person in the country to examine these issues,' he continued. 'What's fascinating is that having thought so deeply about them, he now has a very different approach to the subject than he used to.'

Article text: Another member of the Baltimore Ravens has been arrested this offseason. Running back Bernard Pierce was pulled over in Towson, Maryland, in the early  morning hours of Wednesday and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. This after his teammates Terrence Cody and Victor Hampton were also arrested earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Baltimore Ravens running back Bernard Pierce (above) was pulled over in Towson, Maryland, early Wednesday and charged with driving under the influence . Pierce, a member of the Ravens when they won the 2012 Super Bowl, failed a field sobriety test and was taken in and released from the station after being cooperative with officers . Baltimore County police told The Baltimore Sun that Pierce, 23, was pulled over for speeding around 2am, and after an officer suspected he had been drinking the footballer was ordered to perform a field sobriety test. After failing the test, a cooperative Pierce was taken to the station, processed and later released. According to TMZ, he told police; 'Do you know what happened the last time a Ravens player got a DUI? I'm getting cut tomorrow, not like you care.' Pierce, a member of the team when they won the Super Bowl in 2012, has been charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by alcohol, exceeding maximum speed, and driving a vehicle in excess of reasonable and prudent speed on highway. 'We are aware of the situation and learning more about it. We take these matters seriously,' said Ravens spokesperson Chad Steele. This  just weeks after Hampton, 22, was also arrested and charged with driving under the influence after he was recorded driving 100 mph in a 55-mph zone in North Carolina. He was booked after recording a 0.10 blood-alcohol level, and later released when he posted a $2,500 bond. This also comes just weeks after Pierce's Ravens teammate Victor Hampton (above) was also arrested for a DUI, and cut from the team the next day . Tackle Terrence Cody (above) was also arrested this year and indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury . The Ravens released the cornerback the next day. As for Cody, he was indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury in February following an incident in which his pet alligator allegedly ate his dog. He was also found to have  marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his home. The tackle was also dropped from the team prior to his indictement. Cody claims that his dog died of worms, and not because he was attacked by the alligator, which was illegally owned. All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay (above) in a hotel elevator . All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay in a hotel elevator and team coming under fire for their handling of the situation and questioned over how much they knew about the incident before details were leaked to the public. He was soon cut from the team, but appealed the decision and ultimately won the right to be reinstated in the NFL. He then sued the team for the $3.5million he lost in salary, with the two sides settling out of court before a trial could begin.

Article text: Furious parents have attacked a school's 'ridiculous' uniform policy after dozens of pupils were put in isolation for refusing to remove charity ribbons and badges. Students at The Grange School, in Runcorn, Cheshire, were kept out of lessons today after they refused to remove yellow ribbons and daffodils supporting the Marie Curie cancer charity. Head Barry Carney defended the decision, saying the school selected one charity to support each year and couldn't be seen to prefer one cause over another, but parents branded it 'pathetic'. Student Lily Gaynor, 16, said that up to 70 students from The Grange School, Cheshire, had been taken out of lessons ahead of their GCSEs for refusing to remove the charity pins . Pupil Lily Gaynor alerted a local newspaper to the student's plight by calling them from isolation. She estimated that between 60 and 70 students had been removed from classes. The 16-year-old said: 'We have been taken out of lessons before our GCSEs because we won’t take off our charity badges. 'We’ve got cancer badges and ribbons on our blazers and they’re saying it isn’t part of school uniform and it’s singling out some charities over others. 'We’ve been here about an hour. They’re planning on keeping us here all day. It jeopardises our learning and we’ve got exams soon.' Corinne Versleys, whose daughter Caitlin Mulchrane is among those in isolation, said: 'The school is putting children in the isolation unit for wearing those flowers. 'I think it’s absolutely ridiculous - all it is is a little flower. 'The majority of kids wearing them are dealing with family members with cancer and they’re being told to remove them. I think it’s absolutely pathetic.' The Marie Curie daffodil appeal has been running every March since 1986. Supporters are encouraged to donate in return for a daffodil badge or ribbon which they can wear. Support: Pupils were wearing these flowers and yellow ribbons given out by the Marie Curie cancer charity during March as part of a fundraising drive which last year raised £8.26million . Last year the campaign, which is supported by the likes of actors Olivia Coleman and Dominic West, helped to raise £8.26 million, funding 413,000 hours of nursing care. Despite criticism, Barry Carney, the head of Grange School, said he was simply applying the school's uniform policy, which was available online 'for all to see'. He told the Liverpool Echo: 'Each year we have a nominated charity which we call the head boy and the head girl’s charity. This year it happens to be the Teenage Cancer Trust. 'A number of students have been wearing some badges which are not permitted according to the rules of the school, which are pretty clear. 'When we asked students to remove these badges there has been a small number who have dragged their heels and said because of personal circumstances they want to show their support.' He said he has spoken to these pupils and suggested organising a fundraising event to support the charity, rather than wearing a ribbon or badge. He added that the school holds plenty of charity events, and has raised £1,000 for the Teenage Cancer Charity in the past year, with an open door cafe planned next Thursday. He said the school was contemplating having more than one nominated charity next year.

Article text: (CNN)As many as 13 senior leaders of al-Nusra Front, including the terror group's military commander, were killed in two Syrian airstrikes Thursday, a Middle Eastern security source who was briefed by Syrian intelligence told CNN. Abu Hammam al Shami was among those killed in the strikes against al-Nusra, al Qaeda's largest affiliate in Syria, the source said. Syria's state news agency SANA also reported al Shami's death. The special operation that took place in Hobait, in Idlib province, was part of a wider effort by Syrian forces to destroy areas believed to be gathering points for al-Nusra militants around the province, according to SANA. According to a 2014 al-Nusra video, al Shami joined the group after years of training in Afghanistan and Iraq. Also killed in the northwestern province of Idlib was a senior Saudi operative in the group, the source said. There were initial indications that al-Nusra leader Abu Mohammed al Jolani was wounded in one of the strikes, the source said Thursday. But on Friday, the source told CNN the latest assessment of Syrian intelligence was that al Jolani was not injured. The strikes took place in the towns of Salqin and Hobait, both near the city of Saraqeb in Idlib. One strike targeted a meeting of senior al-Nusra Front leaders; the other was on a home being used as a base, the source said. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition that is hitting ISIS targets in Syria said its planes weren't involved. "Within the last 24 hours, we have not conducted any airstrikes within 200 miles of the province of Idlib," the spokesman said earlier Thursday. Al Shami was featured in a March 2014 video released by al-Nusra Front, in which he discussed his failed attempt to mediate between his militants and ISIS after rising tensions between the groups. The video included a biography by the group of al Shami, which was translated by the Long War Journal. It said that in the late 1990s, al Shami traveled to Afghanistan, where he was trained in a camp run by Abu Musab al Suri, a veteran Syrian jihadi strategist. Al Shami then trained in al Qaeda camps, where he met one of the 9/11 hijackers and personally swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden. By the time of the 9/11 attacks, al Shami had started to train recruits in Afghanistan and was named as the head of the Syrian jihadist contingent within al Qaeda. After the fall of the Taliban, he fled Afghanistan with senior Egyptian al Qaeda operative Sayf al Adel, the group said in the video. Al Shami began operating in Iraq, where he began working with al Qaeda in Iraq founder Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, conducting training for the group during the Iraqi insurgency, the al-Nusra video stated. In 2005, al Shami returned to Afghanistan for a short period, at the request of al Qaeda's leadership. When he got to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, one of bin Laden's top deputies, Attiyah Abd al Rahman, tasked al Shami with leading al Qaeda efforts in Syria, but he was arrested as he traveled through Lebanon, according to the video, and was detained for five years. After being released, he found his way to Syria, where he joined al-Nusra, the group said. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.

Article text: Mount Everest towers over Nepal and although many people dream of scaling its summit, there are beautifully remote villages, farms and monasteries nestled within its huge shadow that are also worth a visit. Last year Google took its Street View cameras on a 10-day trek around the Khumbu region - also known as the Everest region - to explore these quaint landmarks and locations. During the trek the cameras captured the small Sherpa village of Thame, the Phortse Thakiri Chholing Gomba monastery and Khumjung inside the Sagarmatha National Park. Scroll down for video . Google recently took its Street View cameras on a 10-day trek around the Khumbu region - also known as the Everest region - (pictured) to explore the remote villages and landmarks of Nepal. During the trek the cameras captured the small Sherpa village of Thame, the Phortse Thakiri Chholing Gomba monastery and Khumjung inside the Sagarmatha National Park . The trek was led by Apa Sherpa, a 55-year-old Sherpa mountaineer  who holds the world record for reaching the summit of Mount Everest 21 times - more than any other person. He scaled the summit for the first time at the age of 30. In 2009, Apa founded the non-profit Apa Sherpa Foundation to help the local community of young people in the Khumbu region. The Street View images were captured in March 2014 when Apa took members of Google Earth Outreach, and the Nepalese nonprofit Story Cycle through the region. Mount Everest is the Earth's highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres above sea level. In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society upon a recommendation by Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India. Mr Waugh named the mountain after his predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest. It has become a mecca for climbers, and has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet. The southeast ridge was the route used by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay when they reached the summit for the first time in 1953. 'Our region is famous for being home to Everest, but it’s also the home of the Sherpa community and has been for centuries,' Apa said. 'The region has much more to offer than just the mountain. So last year, I guided the Google Maps team through my home region to collect Street View imagery that improves the map of our community. 'Now you can find Thame on the map and explore other communities nestled at the base of Everest, like Khumjung and Phortse.' Thame, and neighbouring upper Thame are small Sherpa villages in the Solukhumbu District of Nepal. Tenzing Norgay, one of the first people to climb Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary grew up in the region and the Thame monastery is one of the oldest in Khumbu. Another village captured by the Street View trekkers was Khumjung. It sits 13,000ft (3,970 metres) above sea level near Mount Khumbila. It is located inside the word heritage site Sagarmatha National Park. 'When people ask what it feels like to reach the top of Mount Everest, I say "heaven,"' added Apa. 'My hope is that my children and future generations have many choices for employment outside of mountaineering.' But the images don't just feature peaks and landscapes. Google also captured parts of the Phortse farming village in the Khumbu Valley including the Thakiri Chholing Gomba, or small monastery. Paintings inside the monastery began in 2008 by Buddhist artists and were completed by the end of 2009 using funding from the Greater Himalayas Foundation. The trek was led by Apa Sherpa (pictured), a 55-year-old Sherpa mountaineer who holds the world record for reaching the summit of Mount Everest 21 times - more than any other person. He scaled the summit for the first time at the age of 30.In 2009, Apa founded the non-profit Apa Sherpa Foundation to help the local community of young people in the Khumbu region .

Google also captured parts of Phortse in the Khumbu Valley, including the Thakiri Chholing Gomba, or small monastery (pictured). The paintings on the monastery walls were started in 2008 by Buddhist artists using funding from the Greater Himalayas Foundation . 'Partnering with Google Maps allowed us to get important local landmarks on the map and share a richer view of Khumbu with the world, including local monasteries, lodges, schools and more, with some yaks along the way!,' continued Apa. Mount Everest: 29,035ft (8,850m) K2: 28,253ft (8,612m) Kangchenjunga: 28,169ft (8,586m) Lhotse:  27,890ft (8,501m) Makalu:  27,765ft (8,462 m) Cho Oyu: 26,906ft (8,201 m) Dhaulagiri: 26,794ft (8,167m) Manaslu: 26,758ft (8,156m) Nanga Parbat: 26,658ft (8,125m) Annapurna: 26,545ft (8,091m) Gasherbrum I: 26,470ft (8,068m) Broad Peak: 26,400ft (8,047m) Gasherbrum II: 26,360ft (8,035m) Shishapangma: 26,289ft (8,013m) 'My hope is that when people see this imagery online, they’ll have a deeper understanding of the region and the Sherpa people that live there. 'Your online trip to my home awaits you on Google Maps. And if you ever get the chance to visit the Khumbu region in person, come stay at the Everest Summiteer Lodge that I built with my own hands. We’ll be ready to welcome you.' Everest is one of 14 mountain peaks on Earth that stand taller than 26,000ft (8,000m) and the local Nepalese name for it is Sagarmatha, which means 'mother of the universe.' Mount Everest is the tallest of these so-called ‘eight-thousanders’ and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared. All 14 of them are found in China, Pakistan or Nepal. Everest’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent began a slow-motion collision with Asia. The edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the Himalayas today. Glaciers have chiselled Mount Everest’s summit into a huge, triangular pyramid, defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast, southeast, and northwest. The southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route. It is the one Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in May 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely. Despite its reputation as an extremely dangerous mountain, commercial guiding has done much to improve the safety of the Everest ascent. As of March 2012, there had been 5,656 successful ascents of Everest, although 223 people had died at fatality rate of 4 per cent. The satellite image was taken in December, just weeks after Nasa captured the rivers of black lava snaking over the snow-covered slopes of the stratovolcano Mount Etna in Sicily. In 2012, mountaineer and filmmaker David Breashears took 477 individual images to create gigapixel image of the Khumbu glacier from the Pumori viewpoint near Mount Everest.

Article text: Tory minister Hugo Swire has been filmed cracking jokes about benefit claimants . Tory minister Hugo Swire has been filmed cracking jokes about benefit claimants at a glamorous party fundraiser. The foreign office minister hosted an auction at the dinner at which donors bid for high-value items – and suggested even those living on welfare could afford to pay £60,000. Mr Swire was the star turn at the secretive Black and White Ball, at which ministers and senior MPs mingle with financiers, industry bosses and other donors to raise money for the General Election. Covert filming of the event has shown Mr Swire - a former director of Sotheby’s - acting as the auctioneer, selling lots including a shoe shopping session with Theresa May, and dinner with Boris Johnson. While bidding is underway for one item, he is heard trying to persuade a guest, who is sitting on the table of Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, to increase his bid. ‘£60,000?’, he says. ‘Ian, persuade him. He’s not on benefits is he? Well if he is then he can afford it.’ He then goes lower, suggesting ‘£55,000?’ At another point in the auction, he comments on the expensive cars the guests are driving. ‘It’s quite naff to have Bentley’s and Rolls Royce and Ferraris because anybody could have them’, he says. And in a reference to the lifestyle of MPs before the 2009 expenses scandal, he said: ‘In the good old days of MP’s expenses we could have them too, but we don’t anymore’. His comments will embarrass the party, after ministers have repeatedly said that the drive to cut welfare has meant ‘difficult decisions’. Unemployment benefit is worth up to £72.40 a week. Old Etonian Mr Swire was elected the MP for East Devon in 2001. He is related to the Swire Group trading dynasty in Hong Kong. During the expenses scandal he was found to have claimed £395 for a laptop bag from the designer brand Mulberry, which he repaid. The footage provides the first public view inside the Ball at the Grosvenor House Hotel – for which donors have paid between £500 and £1,500 a ticket. It was obtained by Paul Wilmott, a hedge fund boss who joined all three major political parties offering a £50,000 donation, in order to highlight the issue of cash for access to politicians for Channel’s 4’s Dispatches programme shown last night. The table plan this year was kept a closely-guarded secret but Mr Willmott, who sat with Welsh secretary Stephen Crabb, said Mr Cameron was on a table with hedge fund manager Andrew Law, City broker Michael Spencer and Ann Summers tycoon Jacqueline Gold. The final bids for the auction items and who bought them is not made public after the dinner, although all donations over £7,500 are properly declared to the Electoral Commission. Hugo Swire was the star turn at the secretive Black and White Ball, at which ministers and senior MPs mingle with financiers, industry bosses and other donors to raise money for the General Election . The fake donor used by Dispatches Paul Wilmott was able to shake hands with David Cameron at the Tory Black and White Ball . Subaskaran Allirajah, the founder of the telephone company Lyca Mobile who sat at a table with treasury minister David Gauke, bid £210,000 for a small bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher. Mr Wilmott shakes hands with David Cameron, and also meets Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, four cabinet ministers and two members of the shadow cabinet, shortly after offering financial support. He approached the Conservative party around six months ago and was also invited to lunch with health secretary Jeremy Hunt along with other donors. Sir Alistair Graham, the former commissioner for standards in public life told Dispatches: ‘I suspect not a lot of policy issues are dealt with at a dinner like that. But I think it’s about that feeling, if I make reasonable donations, I’m in a special club who’ve got access to leaders and that might be extremely useful as far as my business is concerned in the future.’ The Conservative party say ‘the fact that donors are invited to attend events with senior figures within the party is clearly and openly stated on our website.’ They deny any impropriety and say all donations are properly declared to the Electoral Commission. Mr Swire was not available for comment. Mr Wilmott is also filmed having a private meeting with Labour’s Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, to discuss tax matters which could benefit his firm – after offering a donation. Mr Leslie tells him in a follow-up email that he will consider Mr Wilmott’s views about a possible tax on financial transactions ‘ahead of our manifesto’. Labour denied that donors influence party policy. The same businessman approached Labour offering a donation, and was swiftly offered a private meeting with a shadow minister. Paul Wilmott discussed making a donation to the party at last autumn’s annual conference in Manchester, and was invited to a £350-a-head donors’ dinner for free. There, he shook hands with leader Ed Miliband and sat with shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan and small business spokesman Toby Perkins MP. Fake donor Paul Wilmott was put in touch with shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie after offering to make a donation . Back in London, he was put in touch with shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie to discuss the policy he was particularly interested in – a tax on financial transactions which Labour is considering. Over tea at a hotel in Westminster, he is filmed giving his views on the tax and explains how it could help his fictional firm developing software for the hedge fund industry. In a follow-up email, Mr Leslie tells him: ‘Many thanks for this Paul…I think you make some good points about the best way to introduce an FTT…I’ll have a good think about some of these good points ahead of our manifesto but I appreciate any updates you might have along the way.’ Sir Alistair Graham, ex-standards commissioner said: ‘The point about having access to opposition key leaders like Chris Leslie is of course normally their policies are much more fluid. They’re trying to develop policies they think are going to be attractive to the public and you see a specific reference to the manifesto…’ ‘I suspect that the Labour Party would have been quite happy to have his input given his expertise but in this particular case the meeting happened very quickly because he was a prospective donor.’ A Labour party spokesman said frontbenchers regularly meet with business leaders to listen to their views and that ‘donations will not influence our policy.’ Channel 4's Dispatches: How to Buy a Meeting with a Minister .

Article text: A suicide bomber has detonated an explosives-laden car at the gate of a Mogadishu hotel, and at least four gunmen have taken hostages inside the building following a furious shootout with police. At least nine people were killed in the initial blast, while an unknown number of government officials remain trapped inside the building amid sporadic exchanges of gunfire, officials have said. While the hotel, located in Somalia's capital, is popular with government officials, it remains unclear who is being targeted in the attack. However, Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility. Scroll down for video . Two locals carry a wounded boy from the scene of the suicide bombing in Mogadishu today . A hotel guest desperately tries to make his way to the roof of the hotel as militants storm the building .

A Somali man stands next to the wreckage of a car a suicide bomber used to kill at least nine people . Two men badly injured in the bomb blast are helped by a local amid the chaos of the attack . The attack started when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden car at the gate of the hotel today. Gunmen then quickly moved in. Police captain Mohamed Hussein said he had counted at least nine bodies at the scene, and the death toll is likely to rise. Al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab has issued a statement taking responsibility for the blitz. 'We are behind the Hotel Maka Al Mukaram attack, and fighting is still going on inside,' the group's military spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab said. Police surrounded the Hotel Maka Al Mukaram, but heavy gunfire from militants prevented them from mounting a rescue operation. The remains of two destroyed cars could be seen at the gates of the building. 'The hotel is now fully under the control of the militants,' Major Ismail Olow, a Mogadishu police officer at the scene, said. 'Al Shabaab fighters are on the top of the building and inside the hotel. It is not easy for us to go in.'

Al-Shabaab routinely carries out suicide bombings, drive-by shootings and other attacks in Mogadishu, the seat of Somalia's Western-backed government. The militants have continued to launch attacks in Mogadishu despite being ousted from their bases in the seaside city in 2011. Al Shabaab was pushed out of the capital by African peacekeeping forces, but have waged a series of gun and grenade attacks, looking to overthrow the government and impose its strict version of sharia law on the country. An offensive launched last year by African Union forces along with the Somali army has driven the group out of its strongholds in central and southern Somalia, while a series of U.S. drone strikes have killed some of its top leaders. Despite the military campaign, al Shabaab has continued to strike back with often devastating effect using hit-and-run bomb and gun attacks in the capital Mogadishu and other towns. It has also struck out at countries supporting the African Union mission. Security forces discuss how best to tackle the hostage situation which broke out earlier this afternoon .

Article text: MH370 man: The sister of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah has defended her brother in a statement . The sister of the MH370 pilot has urged everyone to stop blaming her brother for the aircraft’s disappearance ahead of the anniversary of the tragedy this week. Sakinah Shah has released a statement in defence of her brother, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, who headed the crew on the missing jet, where she claims there is no proof of 'wrongdoing'. Her statement comes as Malaysia’s Transport Minister has admitted that if the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is not found by May search efforts will go ‘back to the drawing board’. Ms Sakinab's statement on behalf of the family was released through The Star in Malaysia, just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the disappearance of MH370 on Sunday. ‘As things stand today, with no tangible evidence to show no-one, be you politician, scientist, aviation expert, plane crash investigator, pilot, retired pilot, media or whoever else, none of you have the right to blame Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah for any wrongdoing.’ Ms Sakinab recalled how on March 8 2014 her life and the lives of all the families and friends of passengers an crew of the aircraft changed for ever. She recalled how at the time of the ‘tragic occurrence of MH370’ her brother, a father-of-three, was 53 years old and married to his childhood sweetheart Faizah Khanum. Ms Sakinab described her brother as a 'doting father, generous, kind and cool with a warm sense of humour. He had a passion for life, for family and above all for flying. ‘I wasn't kidding when I said that if he could he would have attached wings to himself. He had as much as a man could possibly want in his life; a professional career, family, friends, health and a more than comfortable life. ‘He was very open-minded, coming from a family with a pretty wide range of nationalities through intermarriages. He got on extremely well with family members. The younger ones simply adored him... their Uncle Ari. ‘He was very savvy at DIY. He could fix anything; garden fixtures, floor tiles, old doors, etc. My home and the homes of my sisters and brothers are not short of the things that remind us of him every day; framed pictures, leaking windows now repaired, a fish pond levelled up and nicely tiled, a new TV installed... I could go on and on. 'Back to the drawing board': Malaysia’s Transport Minister Seri Liow Tiong Lai has said that the  search area would be extended if the missing MH370 jet is not found by May . Missing: This Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of the disappearance of flight MH370 . Still lost: The Boeing 777-200 Malaysia Airlines plane was carrying 227 passengers and a crew of 12 when it suddenly disappeared off the radar on March 8, 2014 . ‘The rollercoaster ride since March 2014 has never really stopped, except perhaps momentarily. I want the world to know here is a loving man who will stop at nothing to render help when it is needed. ‘His presence during every family function never failed to light up the occasions. He was always sought after by sisters, brothers, nieces and nephews alike… a man of integrity. He was a generous brother and uncle who often came bearing gifts from his overseas trips. 'Ari was a simple village boy of humble beginnings but had high ambitions of becoming a commercial pilot. 'With the current chatter about MH370 involving big name media organisations like National Geographic, I feel compelled to divulge some information about Captain Zaharie's scholastic ‘prowess’ and academic achievements. ‘I am doing this with some regret knowing that he would not be too happy at this disclosure. Throughout his secondary schooling he was by no means a student genius. In fact he was just an average student. Such being the situation, he certainly didn't have the right foundation to be able to figure out a scheme to hijack his own plane and then to disappear into thin air without leaving a trace. ‘Without a doubt he had a strong sense for loyalty towards Malaysia Airlines (MAS). His aviation training in the Philippines was sponsored by MAS. It was there he served as a pilot and later as a training captain. He had an unblemished flying record of eighteen thousand plus hours, I am proud to say. It is sheer dedication to this profession that prompted him to set up his own home flight simulator just to equip himself in order to give a better teaching experience to his students, all at his own expense. ‘As a training captain he often expressed joy and satisfaction with the camaraderie he shared with all his students. Following March 8th 2014, we received feedback from many of these students, both locally and internationally, all in praise of his accommodating ways and generosity at sharing his knowledge. ‘I know for certain Zaharie opted to remain loyal to MAS despite a few challenging offers from other airlines that came his way. It was his love for family that made him want to remain with MAS until his retirement. ‘When the devastating news of MH370 was broadcast, like everybody else, we were also in a state of shock and disbelief. ‘The last time we met with Zaharie was some two weeks prior to March 8th when we were together for dinner. He was no different from his normal, usual self. He was loud, jovial, and full of chuckles with his share of jokes. ‘We continue to pray and hope that this bizarre mystery will unravel soon. We stand firm in the belief that no matter how long the night, dawn will still break.' Ms Sakinab's statement was released as Malaysia’s Transport Minister Seri Liow Tiong Lai suggested that the search area would be extended if MH370 is not found by May. This means that once again, the search will be carried out from the southern Indian Ocean to the Himalayan Mountains, as far west as the Maldives and as far east - and beyond - as the South China Sea. Mr Liow’s admission is unlikely to provide any comfort to the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the Boeing 777 when it vanished on March 8 last year about an hour into a six-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Search efforts: Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott said this week that the search for MH370 off the coast of Australia might have to be scaled back after the year-long-search . He told the New Straits Times that any decision to re-strategise the search - or look again at the methods employed - would only be done if the current scouring of the ocean floor in the southern Indian Ocean did not find the aircraft’s wreckage. ‘It is important to continue the search and hopefully we can complete it by then,’ he said in a reference to May. ‘If the plane is not found we will have to evaluate the figures and rely on the experts to guide us on what to do next. ‘We are confident that the plane is situated in the identified search area in the south Indian Ocean and we are looking forward to finding it,’ said Mr Liow, speaking in Kuala Lumpur. He was responding to a comment by Australia’s Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, who said this week that the search and recovery effort might have to be scaled back after the year-long-search. ‘There is no discussion on the issue to stop the search,’ said Mr Liow. ‘This is because as far as we are concerned, it is a tripartite decision (between Australia, Malaysia and China) that has made a commitment to complete the search in the 60,000 square kilometers. Therefore it has to continue.’ Australian search director, Paul Kennedy, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation today that ‘we’re scanning continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 'They’re out there for six weeks at a time. And as we search the ground, we analyse the data and we’re just looking everywhere for the plane. Eventually, we’ll find it.’ Mr Kennedy admitted that the search team had a ‘massive responsibility’ to give closure to the families and everybody else who flies on an aircraft. Theories of where the Malaysia Airlines aircraft ended up have covered numerous seas and countries, the reasons for the plane’s disappearance ranging from the credible to the crazy. Despite the massive search currently taking place in the southern Indian Ocean and requests for coastal villagers to keep their eyes open for debris that might have washed up on beaches, not a single piece of evidence from the aircraft has been found.

Article text: Should Rangers win promotion to the Premiership this season they will have to pay Newcastle United £500,000 as part of the loan deal struck with the St James' Park club for five players. The details emerged this morning as Rangers released financial results which showed the club had made losses after tax of £2.89m for the six-month period to 31 December 2014. Interim chairman Paul Murray described the accounts as 'disappointing'. Haris Vuckic celebrates after scoring in Rangers' 4-1 victory against Cowdenbeath on Saturday . This arrangement with Newcastle was part of a deal struck by the previous board for five fringe players - Gael Bigirimana, Haris Vuckic, Kevin Mbabu, Remie Streete and Shane Ferguson. Only Vuckic has made any sort of impact for the Ibrox club so far. Indeed three of the five players who signed the loan agreements have yet to kick a ball for Rangers, who are currently second in the Championship and can only now be promoted through the play-offs. The prize money for finishing as runners-up in the second tier is £342,000. Despite promotion to the Championship, revenue fell £100,000 to £13.1m, though the club earned £1.3m from hosting the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens. Sponsorship revenue also dropped, falling by £0.3m to £0.4m. Loan signings Vuckic (centre), Gael Bigirimana (left) and Remie Streete are unveiled at Murray Park last month . Murray, who along with Dave King and John Gilligan, ousted the previous board, said: 'The new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club, its people and its history. 'The mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering. 'As the Interim Accounts prove, the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts. Paul Murray (left) and Dave King are pictured back at Ibrox after the EGM earlier this month . 'We can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning, investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders. 'Too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular. But they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated, not only for its own good but for the greater good of Scottish football.'
