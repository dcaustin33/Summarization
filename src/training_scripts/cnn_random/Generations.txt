Article text: Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini appears to be under pressure after failing to improve Inter Milan's fortunes since taking up at the reins at the San Siro. Mancini looks a distressed figure on the front cover of Monday's La Gazzetta dello Sport after seeing his side fail to claim all three points against Serie A relegation candidates Cesena. The 50-year-old conceded after his side's 1-1 draw with Cesena that his side were going to struggle to qualify for next season's Champions League. Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini looked extremely distressed after seeing his side slip up against Cesena . Mancini could hardly watch as his side fought to save face against relegation battlers Cesena . Inter  must finish third or win the Europa League if they are to qualify for next season's Champions League . Inter either have to close the nine-point gap on third-placed Lazio or turnaround their two-legged encounter against Wolfsburg, which they lost 3-1 in Germany, before going on to win the Europa League. Mancini told Sky Sport Italia after Sunday's encounter against Cesena:'With a win we would've climbed to 39 points with 11 rounds to go. 'Now it's going to be pretty difficult to reach third place. 'With a victory we could've had hope, but there are too many teams in front of us now. 'At the moment there's no point talking about third place and it's not even logical to do so.' Inter host Wolfsburg on Thursday before facing Sampdoria at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Inter Milan's players look subdued despite  Rodrigo Palacio's equaliser against Cesena on Sunday . Cesena, who are second bottom of the Serie A, opened the scoring with a lobbed finish from Gregoire Defrel .

Article text: A father-of-six oral surgeon and his 21-year-old assistant were killed after their SUV fell from a bridge and into an icy creek in Texas. Robert Weinstein, 71, and Abigail Resendiz were identified as the two passengers who died in the accident at Mary's Creek in Tarrant County, which happened around 9.30pm on Saturday. The car's driver, an unidentified woman, was injured but able to free herself from the vehicle and call for help. Robert Weinstein, 71, and Abigail Resendiz, 21, were killed after the SUV they were riding in hit an icy patch and flipped into Mary's Creek in Tarrant County, Texas at 9.30pm on Saturday . Forth Worth Fire Department divers spent an hour trying to free Weinstein and Resendiz but  they were daunted by the freezing water, according to spokesman Lt. Michael Glynn. 'Within four to five minutes, they're very cold and having trouble functioning and coordinating their efforts,' he said. Glynn said that the temperature and darkness were the 'worst possible scenario' the divers could have had and that it was 'incredibly difficult' for them to operate in the conditions. Diver teams had to rotate every five minutes, according to the Dallas Morning News. Resendiz was eventually freed from the car, but passed away in the hospital.

Dive teams had to rotate every five minutes because the cold water impacted their ability to function and coordinate their efforts, according to a fire department spokesman . Firefighters had to use the jaws of life to free Weinstein from the vehicle. He died at the scene. Resendiz and Weinstein's cause of death was listed as drowning, with hypothermia and collision impact included as factors, according to WFAA-8. Weinstein's brother Loren said Robert and his two staff members were returning from Odessa, where they travel to every month to help other oral surgeons with high demand in the area. He said Robert's SUV hit a patch of ice on the way home and flipped into the creek. Glynn said Fort Worth police are still investigating what caused the accident but believe weather played a contributing factor. Resendiz and Weinstein's cause of death was listed as drowning, with hypothermia and collision impact included as factors . Dr. Charles Chilcoat, who worked with both Weinstein and Resendiz, said he was shocked to learn about their deaths. Chilcoat said Weinstein was 'like a brother to him', who traveled the world with his wife and was a 'mentor to me and a good friend', he told NBC DFW 5. He said Resendiz was a 'good kid' who was always helping him remain upbeat and optimistic. 'She'd say "come on Dr. Chilcoat, we just have one more patient, you can get through it."' 'She was just 21 years old, and that's so sad.' Weinstein's brother Loren said Robert and his two staff members were traveling on the bridge (pictured) on their way home from Odessa, where they travel to every month to help other oral surgeons with high demand .

Article text: Gareth Lee (pictured leaving court today) said he was left 'shocked' and in 'disbelief' when the bakery refused his order . A Christian baker who refused to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan has begun a court battle over equality laws. Belfast-based Ashers Bakery refused to make a cake featuring an image of Sesame Street puppets Bert and Ernie below the motto 'Support Gay Marriage'. Northern Ireland's Equality Commission is now supporting a legal action against the family-run bakery on behalf of gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose order was declined. Mr Lee told a court today he was left 'shocked' and in 'disbelief' when one of the owners of the bakery, Karen McArthur, rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for. 'It made me feel I'm not worthy, a lesser person and to me that was wrong,' he said. Opening the case, Robin Allen QC, representing Mr Lee, said the baker's objection on religious grounds was not lawful. He said baking a cake did not mean the bakers supported any message the cake might carry and compared the baking of a cake to a postman delivering a letter or a printer printing a poster. 'A postman taking a letter to the door or a printer carrying out a printing job - nobody would say that involved promoting or support,' he said. 'It's simply a functional relationship, a working relationship.' The lawyer also noted the publicity around the case and highlighted that politicians, church figures, bloggers and others had expressed opinions on the matter. But the barrister insisted the case must be judged on the facts alone, saying: 'Law must not be determined by those who shout loudest.' Mr Allen QC said he was not in court to challenge the McArthur family's faith and highlighted that the proposed design would not have had an Ashers logo on it. The case is being heard at Belfast County Court by district judge Isobel Brownlie. The Commission, which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region, has alleged that the stance of the company was in breach of legislation. The case has sharply divided public opinion in Northern Ireland and beyond. In the wake of the bakery's refusal to provide the service last May, the commission, a state-funded watchdog body, took on the case on behalf of Mr Lee. Initially, the commission asked the bakery to acknowledge that it had breached legislation and offer 'modest' damages to the customer. Claims of discrimination were made after a Christian-run bakery in Northern Ireland refused to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan on it on religious grounds. Pictured, left: The design. Pictured, right: Belfast Councillor Andrew Muir cutting the cake which was eventually made by another bakery . Ashers bakery general manager Daniel McArthur, supported by his wife Amy (right), has said he is fighting the case to allow Christian business owners to follow their beliefs in how they run their firms . When Ashers, which is owned by the McArthur family, refused, the commission proceeded with the legal action. Outlining his view of the facts, Mr Allen said Mr Lee had used the bakery in Royal Avenue in Belfast city centre 'regularly' before the incident. He said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service whereby images could be printed in edible icing on a cake. He said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to 'religious scruples'. The barrister told the court that the order was accepted by Ashers director Karen McArthur and Mr Lee paid for it in full. 'A contract was therefore concluded,' he said. Mr Allen said that, over the next few days, Mrs McArthur expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter-in-law, Amy, and the matter was then discussed with her son, Daniel. After that Mr Lee was informed that his order would not be processed due to the family's religious views, said the lawyer. A court was told  that for the bakery to refuse to make the cake was like a postman refusing to deliver letters . Mr Allen said if companies were allowed to break contracts with individuals then 'the law is worth nothing'. He added: 'The rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the commercial sphere.' The barrister insisted that Ashers was not an 'explicitly religious' business and referred to an interview Daniel McArthur gave to a newspaper in which he claimed the majority of his 60-plus workforce were unaware of his family's faith. Mr Allen stressed the importance of anti-discrimination legislation in Northern Ireland, given its history of sectarian strife. Daniel and Amy McArthur sat on one side of an almost packed courtroom, with Mr Lee watching from the other side. The Ashers case has prompted the Democratic Unionist Party to propose a law change at Stormont that would provide an 'equality clause' which would essentially enable businesses to refuse to provide certain services on religious grounds. Mr McArthur has previously said: Mr McArthur has previously insisting that Christians should be able to apply their beliefs to the day-to-day running of their businesses. He said: 'I would like the outcome of this to be that any Christians running a business could be allowed to follow their Christian beliefs and principles in the day-to-day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that.' The hearing continues. Mr McArthur, with his wife Amy and daughter Robyn, sat in court today to hear the legal argument .

Article text: Green electric-powered cars are much more dangerous to pedestrians than traditional vehicles with petrol engines, a charity report said yesterday. It found that walkers are 40 per cent more likely to be run over by a quiet hybrid or electric car than by one with a petrol or diesel engine. And as the number of green vehicles grows because of Government tax breaks for eco-friendly cars, the number of injuries they cause has been rising fast, it said. Scroll down for video . Cars with electric or hybrid engines, which are much quieter than regular petrol cars, are driving a huge rise in accidents among pedestrians who do not hear them coming . The report from the Guide Dogs charity found a 54 per cent increase in pedestrian injuries in accidents involving quiet cars between 2012 and 2013. The charity – which says that guide dog owners and their animals are particularly at risk from vehicles that they cannot hear coming – called for laws to make noise generating systems compulsory on all hybrids. Guide Dogs manager James White said: ‘Quiet vehicles put pedestrians at risk outside schools, in residential areas and in our towns and cities. 'The Government is spending hundreds of millions of pounds to increase the numbers of quiet cars on the roads, and while we support the development of environmentally friendly vehicles, more needs to be done to protect pedestrian safety.’ The call for legislation was backed with a survey carried out  by YouGov which found more than three quarters thought hybrids make the roads less safe for blind or partially-sighted pedestrians. Similar proportions thought quiet green cars are a threat to older people and to children. Electric cars and hybrids running under electric power move silently and are likely to surprise people on foot who expect to hear the approach of a vehicle. The visually impaired are among the worst affected by the switch to electric as guide dogs also struggle to identify the threat, with campaigners calling for noise generators to be made compulsory . Car builders and independent companies have been working on a range of artificial sound generators that would lessen the risk of accidents. Most involve speakers fixed to the car, which work in the direction the car is moving to reduce nuisance to people who are not in the way. Sounds promoted vary from a reproduction of the whine of an old electric motor through computerised squawks to a rumble reminiscent of a diesel or petrol combustion engine. EU rules say such generators must be fitted to quiet cars by 2021, but Guide Dogs said that before then there will be thousands more potentially dangerous green cars on the road. It said that car makers should ‘do the right thing and fit sound generating systems to quiet vehicles before it becomes compulsory.’ Legislation in Britain should also insist that noise-making equipment is not only fitted to a car but always switched on, Guide Dogs said. The charity’s campaign was supported by Paralympic sprinter Libby Clegg. Miss Clegg, who has only peripheral vision, said: ‘I rely on being able to hear cars to judge when it is safe to cross the road. ‘It is terrifying to cross when you are unable to hear quiet hybrid and electric vehicles. Ensuring all quiet vehicles have sound generating systems installed and switched on would ensure that millions of people, like me, who are living with sight loss, would be protected from the growing safety hazard.’

Article text: Amnesty International has concluded that Hamas committed war crimes during the 2014 Gaza conflict by firing rockets 'indiscriminately' at civilian areas and using non-combatants as human shields. 'In launching these attacks, [Palestinian jihadis] displayed a flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law and for the consequences of their violations on civilians in both Israel and the Gaza Strip,' said Philip Luther, Amnesty's director for the Middle East and North Africa. The report concluded that rocket attacks had killed six civilians in Israel, including a child. Other rockets aimed at the Jewish state fell short and killed at least 13 Palestinian civilians, 11 of them children, on the beach in Gaza, in an attack that was wrongly blamed on Israel. Scroll down for video . War crimes: Amnesty International has found that Palestinian militants displayed 'flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law' by firing rockets from civilian areas into civilian areas . Pain: Family members and relatives of four-year-old Daniel Tregerman, who was killed by shrapnel from a Palestinian rocket, mourn during his funeral in 2014 . Deadly: A rocket is fired from Gaza City towards Israel. Amnesty International described them as 'indiscriminate', and said that they killed more Palestinians than Israelis when they misfired . Palestinian witnesses had claimed that an Israeli F-16 warplane had killed Palestinian civilians on the beach. But the Amnesty report has corroborated the Israeli army's account of events, which said that the deaths occurred when militants misfired their own rockets. 'An independent munitions expert who examined the available evidence... concluded that the projectile used in the attack was a Palestinian rocket,' the report said. It confirmed that during the 50-day war, Palestinian terrorists launched unguided rockets and mortars from civilian areas toward other civilian areas, constituting a breach of international law. Figures released by the Israeli army after the war ended on 26 August showed that Gaza militants fired 4,591 projectiles at Israel. Of those, 3,659 struck Israeli territory and 735 were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system, leaving another 197 falling short and landing inside the coastal enclave. Militant groups used unguided projectiles which were 'inherently indiscriminate,' the report said, noting that this is 'prohibited under international law' and 'constitutes a war crime'. Luther demanded that Palestinian armed groups 'end all direct attacks on civilians', and take all feasible precautions 'to protect civilians in the Gaza Strip from the effects of such attacks', including launching attacks 'within or near densely populated areas.' Other war crimes committed by Palestinian terrorists  included storing munitions in civilian buildings and U.N. schools and launching attacks from areas densely populated with civilians, effectively using them as human shields. Luther called on both Israeli and Palestinian authorities to cooperate with U.N. and International Criminal Court probes 'to end decades of impunity that have perpetuated a cycle of violations in which civilians on both sides have paid a heavy price'. Hamas official Taher al-Nounou denied the allegations in the Amnesty report, saying that Hamas did not target civilians. An Islamic Jihad spokesman, Daud Shihab, said that the rocket fire was in self-defence, and did little damage in comparison to Israel's weapons. The 50-day Gaza war claimed the lives of about 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis.

Article text: Inhaling the delicate bouquet of a glass of wine can leave most of us at a loss for words to describe what we are smelling. But it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell. Scientists have found that English speakers struggle to identify and describe odours compared to other languages. I'm getting blackberries and thistles: The English language is not the best for describing odours say scientists . Researchers found those who use English as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour. However, native speakers from the Jahai tribe in Perak, Malaysia, described odours far more consistently and in less time than they can a colour. Looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant, scientists have found. Researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free. The scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese. Surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher BMI themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating. This suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat. The Jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the Maniq, a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern Thailand, have 15 words. These abstract words describe smells in the same way as we use blue, red and yellow to describe colours. The findings suggest English speakers appear to have lost the ability to accurately describe smells. Professor Asifa Majid, who led the work at the centre for language studies at Radboud University in Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, said: 'Our findings show that the long-held assumption that people are bad at naming smells is not universally true. 'Odours are expressible in language, as long as you speak the right language.' Professor Majid has found that the English language has few specific words that are capable of describing smells. One of the few that is used is the term 'musty', which describes a stuffy and dusty odour of an old book or room that has been unused for a long time. Most of the time English speakers have to rely upon the source of the smell as a description - using words like fruity or lemon. In a study published in the journal Cognition, Professor Majid asked 10 American English speakers and 10 native speakers of the Jahai to describe colours and odours. They were presented with 12 odours, including cinnamon, turpentine, lemon, smoke, chocolate, rose, onion and gasoline, and 80 different colours. They found that when describing the odours, there was little agreement among English speakers when describing the odours. The Jahai use 12 abstract words to describe odours (shown, left) in the same way they do colours (right) In many western societies, smell has become a largely under-used sense. In many cases odours have become something undesirable and to be avoided, according to Professor Majid (picture posed by a model) They also used far longer descriptions when identifying the smells. For example when presented with a cinnamon odour, English speakers described it as spicy, sweet, candy, smoky, wine and pot pourri. However, the Jahai were found to use a series of succinct terms to describe the smells, such words that mean to 'smell edible' and 'to have a bloody smell that attracts tigers'. These works were predominantly abstract words, much like those they used for colour. However, while abstract words were dominant among the English speakers when describing colour, they used source based descriptions. In a later study in the journal of Cognition, Professor Majid and her colleagues looked at the language of the Maniq, a 300 strong nomadic tribe in southern Thailand, and found they use words for smell that have complex meanings. They wrote: 'Smell is particularly important in the lives of the Maniq, and lies at the core of the indigenous ideology. The table above shows the specific abstract words used by the Maniq tribes to describe different odours . 'The Maniq surround themselves with odors believed to be beneficial for health and that repel danger. They stay constantly alert for potentially harmful odors. 'The Maniq system is remarkable because there are dedicated terms for olfaction and these are part of everyday talk. Western languages simply lack this. When describing smells, English speakers, for example, most often resort to source-descriptors, such as like a banana or fruity, but even these descriptors are not applied accurately.' It is unclear exactly why English speakers have lost the ability to describe smells accurately, but vision has become the predominant sense in almost all human cultures. In a recent study published in the journal of Cognitive Linguistics, Professor Majid and her colleagues found that English speakers use specific words for vision and hearing but have few for the other senses like touch, smell and taste. There is a similar pattern in other western languages. However, smell plays a far greater role in the language of the Semai of Malaysia, for example. Speaking to New Scientist, Professor Majid said: 'There seems to be something culturally different too. 'People in the West seem to do everything they can to get rid of smells, and in many contexts odour is a taboo topic. 'This might be linked to changes in our smell environment since the industrial revolution. 'If you read stories from the UK or France from before the revolution, there's sewage in the streets and people are using perfume to cover up body odour. 'These days, we do everything we can to sanitise our environment.'

Article text: A man who took up an offer from two strangers in the street to smoke marijuana later had his clothes stolen by them after being assaulted, police in San Francisco said. The victim’s ordeal began in the early hours of Thursday morning when he was asked by two men in the Nob Hill area of the city to smoke marijuana with them. The 35-year-old Californian agreed and they walked to an apartment, or possibly a hotel room, in the 2000 block of Polk Street, according to local media. A man who took up an offer from two strangers in the street to smoke marijuana later had his clothes stolen by them after being assaulted, police in San Francisco said . Quoting a police source, nbcdfw.com said that after arriving in the room the victim took his jacket and pants off, having become too warm. After visiting the bathroom, the victim was punched in the face by the two suspects, who then took his cellphone, wallet and clothing, the site said. Police were called to the scene at 3.45am. The victim refused medical treatment for minor bruising to his cheek. He described his attackers as black, between 25 and 35 years old, with one dressed in a hoodie and dark jeans, the other wearing dark clothes. It follows news that a year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, sales hit nearly $700million. In its first annual report, it was revealed that 49.7 tons (109,578 pounds) of medical marijuana flowers were sold in 2014, while 17.5 tons (38,660 pounds) were sold in the retail market, said the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. Sales hit nearly $700 million last year, with medical marijuana accounting for $386million and recreational pot bringing in $313million. But recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report. In total, 4.81million units of edible marijuana were sold - which would equal giving one edible to almost every resident in Colorado, according to 9News. A year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, 17 tons of the recreational buds were bought by consumer (above Tyler Williams of Blanchester, Ohio selects marijuana strains from the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary in December 2014)

Article text: Anne Dobson, 39, was jailed for two years and four months after stealing money from the families of three residents at the care home where she worked . A conwoman who used her job working at a care home to steal £116,000 from the families of vulnerable residents used it to pay for a lifestyle she could not afford. Anne Dobson, 39, splashed £20,000 on a wedding ceremony, another £4,000 on the honeymoon, and bought herself a new car worth £16,000. She tricked the families of three residents of Broomfield Grange Care Home, Essex, into paying their monthly bill of around £1,200 directly into her bank account. She then passed the money on to her employer Embrace All Care Homes, but not before taking £400 from each bill for herself. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that she began taking the funds in order to pay down debts she had racked up, but soon went on a spending spree than included a £1,000 holiday. Andrew Jackson, QC, prosecuting, said: 'In 2013 she was marrying again and needed to pay for her wedding and she could not afford the sort of wedding she wanted so continued to defraud the company. 'She paid for her own wedding which she told police had cost about £20,000 and on top of that a honeymoon to the tune of £4,000, all of which were funded by the ongoing fraud. 'By 2013 she was on top of her debts and she freely admitted that it was to pay for the wedding.' The 'simple' scheme worked like clockwork each month, the court was told, until one of the residents' families thought to question the amounts being paid. When interviewed by police, Dobson admitted her actions, telling officers she felt 'crap' for what she had done. At one stage the mum from Witham, Essex, even wrote a £7,000 cheque to one resident in a bid to relieve her of her burden of guilt. Mr Jackson added: 'It was a gross breach of the trust that the company placed in her. 'She played a leading role - she was the author of this fraud - there was an abuse of her position of trust and responsibility.' Miss Penny Summers, mitigating, said Dobson was 'absolutely and thoroughly ashamed of herself' and had yet to tell her children of her actions. She said: 'In the beginning, she was in financial difficulties - however she explained to me that there was no excuse for it ongoing. Dobson (right) gave her personal bank details to three families, collected their monthly bills, skimmed £800 off for herself, then paid the rest to her employer. She then spent some of the money on a £20,000 wedding . Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Dobson also paid £4,000 for a honeymoon, £16,000 for a car, and another £1,000 on a holiday. She also used the money to pay off debts . 'The money was used to pay for her wedding and honeymoon.' Dobson, who wore a black jacket and scarf, black skirt and knee-high black boots, sat with her head bowed in the dock listening to the evidence. She sobbed as she was sentenced. Sentencing her to two years and four months in jail, Recorder Mark Ockelton, told her: 'You were not in debt at the time - it was committed in order to give you a lifestyle of the sort you thought you ought to have. '£20,000 on a wedding, another £4,000 on a honeymoon, then you bought a new car for £16,000 and spent £1,300 on holiday and that still leaves tens of thousands of pounds unaccounted for.' A proceeds of crime hearing will take place later this year in order to try to recoup some of the missing money. Dobson had joined the Embrace care company as a receptionist before being promoted to the role of administrator - a role which gave her access to residents personal files. Mr Jackson said: 'It became plain that she has been syphoning considerable amounts of money. 'Her role was to update the company head office with regards to what residents or patients would be paying for care - that amounts having been agree with the residents and the care home. 'Once the fee for the care has been agreed, what should happened, by direct debit or standing order, the resident would pay weekly or monthly the required amount direct to the care home.' Dobson admitted a single charge of fraud between July 1, 2012 and July 31, 2014.

Article text: Wolfsburg midfielder Kevin de Bruyne is a transfer target for Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. The former Chelsea man has been in sensational form this season, bagging nine goals and 17 assists in 26 appearances while helping steer Wolfsburg to second in the German league. De Bruyne is contracted to Wolfsburg until 2019 but, according to newspaper Sport Bild, Bayern are keeping tabs on the Belgian as Pep Guardiola's side look to line up a long-term successor to Arjen Robben, who is out of contract in 2017. Kevin de Bruyne is attracting attention from Bayern Munich as his brilliant form continues for Wolfsburg . German newspaper Sport Bild are reporting that Bayern  will target a move for De Bruyne . The Belgian international (right) has scored nine goals in 26 appearances for Wolfsburg so far this season . Bild also report that Bayern may wait until the summer of 2016 to make a move for De Bruyne, who they believe is currently worth around £35million on current form. Meanwhile, De Bruyne's Wolfsburg team-mate Marcel Schafer has urged the 23-year-old to stay for at least another season. He told reporters: 'I think that our chances [of keeping De Bruyne] are really good. He has already experienced not getting so much time on the field at Chelsea, a top club in Europe. Jose Mourinho deemed De Bruyne surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge last year . 'And that is why I think the best thing for him would be to stay for minimum one more year at Wolfsburg. Next year he could play Champions League here and win titles with us. 'If you want to win titles you need extraordinary players. And you really have to say that Kevin de Bruyne is at the moment the best player in the Bundesliga not only because of his stats. You can see that in every single game. And we're really, really happy to have him and to keep him until next season or maybe a little bit longer.'

Article text: A year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, sales hit nearly $700million as 17 tons of the recreational buds were bought by consumers in the state's first year of full legalization. However sales for medicinal pot still outstripped the recreational sales by almost 50 tons, according to officials. In its first annual report, it was revealed that 49.7 tons (109,578 pounds) of medical marijuana flowers were sold in 2014, while 17.5 tons (38,660 pounds) were sold in the retail market, said the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division.

Sales hit nearly $700 million last year, with medical marijuana accounting for $386million and recreational pot bringing in $313million. But recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report. In total, 4.81million units of edible marijuana were sold - which would equal giving one edible to almost every resident in Colorado, according to 9News. In a national first, voters in Colorado and Washington state opted to legalize recreational marijuana use by adults in landmark twin ballots in 2012, and the first retail stores opened in Colorado on January 1, 2014. States such as Oregon and Alaska, which have now also voted to legalize recreational pot as well as others where lawmakers face proposals to do so, are watching the Colorado results closely. Recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report (above a info-graphic created illustrating the findings from the report) Findings also showed that 322 retail stores were licensed at the end of the year, up from about 200 six months earlier, while 833 licenses were issued to retail businesses in general, and 1,416 medical marijuana businesses were approved by the state. It said medical businesses were cultivating around 300,000 marijuana plants on average each month during 2014, while the number of retail plants rose steadily from fewer than 25,000 in January to nearly 217,000 during December. The report noted that more than twice as many Colorado jurisdictions had 'completely opted out' of allowing either retail or medicinal pot businesses to operate than had permitted them. The state's marijuana laws have been challenged in federal court by neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, which argue weed is smuggled across their borders. Some Colorado residents said the pot industry has hurt their families, businesses or property values . Sixty-seven jurisdictions allow medical and retail licensees, 21 permit only medical, and five only retail, while 228 jurisdictions prohibit them both. The state's marijuana laws have been challenged in federal court by neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, which argue weed is smuggled across their borders. Some Colorado residents said the pot industry has hurt their families, businesses or property values. Supporters said voters have chosen to take the trade out of the hands of criminals, and a Quinnipiac University Poll this week showed that 58 percent of Colorado residents support marijuana legalization, versus 38 percent against it.

Article text: Struck off: Kelvin Loraine, 31, travelled 400 miles to have sex with the girl once she turned 16 . A teacher who groomed a teenage girl and made her enter a 'slave contract' before travelling 400 miles to have sex with her once she turned 16 has been struck off. Kelvin Loraine, 31, met the then 15-year-old girl on an online chatroom in March 2013, after which she sent him dozens of naked images of herself and performed sex acts on Skype at his behest. Shortly after the girl, referred to as Child A, turned 16, Loraine travelled more than 400 miles from his home in Durham to have sex with her in a hotel room in Plymouth, the National College for Teaching and Leadership was told. The disgraced teacher, who taught maths at a Sunderland school, admitted to also having let her watch him perform a sex act on himself via the video chat. He admitted receiving up to 40 photographs of her naked body - although he claimed this happened after her 16th birthday. A professional conduct panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership said Loraine admitted unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute after a private meeting in Coventry. He had already received a caution from Durham Constabulary last July for possessing an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of the child - with whom he first came into contact in the spring of 2013. In a written ruling the panel said: 'Child A would have been 15 years old at that time. They had daily contact online and by phone. Mr Loraine admits his communications, online and by phone, with Child A were romantic and sometimes sexual in nature. 'He admits he became aware she was 15 years of age at some point after the relationship commenced and at least 6 weeks before Child A's 16th birthday. 'Mr Loraine accepts Child A sent approximately 30 - 40 photographs of her naked body to him, sometimes but not always at his request. 'Mr Loraine asserts that this did not occur until after Child A's 16th birthday and during these communications Mr Loraine requested that Pupil A touch herself intimately using her finger, her hairbrush and a sex toy and that he viewed her performing these acts via Skype. 'Mr Loraine admits that this was for his sexual gratification. Mr Loraine also admits that, shortly after Child A's 16th birthday, he and Child A entered into a 'slave contract' - the written terms of which are attached to the Agreed Statement of Facts. Bad teacher: Loraine met the then 15-year-old girl on an online chatroom after which she sent him dozens of naked images of herself and performed sex acts on Skype at his behest (stock image) 'Mr Loraine admits that his conduct was sexually motivated. On 30 November 2013, shortly after Child A's 16th birthday, Mr Loraine arranged to meet her at a hotel in Plymouth and travelled there from his home in Durham. They then engaged in consensual sexual intercourse.' He agreed to the police caution on the basis she was 16 when the picture in his possession was taken and he was unaware an individual had to be 18 for such pictures to be legal. The panel said the inappropriate relationship started when she was 15 and continued after she turned 16. Although he was not her teacher he did tell her he was a teacher. The panel said this had the potential for establishing her trust in him and influencing her behaviour. They said: 'The panel is satisfied it is necessary for a prohibition order to be imposed in order to protect pupils and other members of the public, maintain public confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct.' They also recommended the case was so serious there should be no provision for him to apply to have it set aside in the future. Paul Heathcote, decision-maker for the National College for Teaching and Leadership panel, said: 'The panel is satisfied Mr Loraine's behaviour is incompatible with being a teacher. 'He was the instigator of indecent images of a child being taken which he then had in his possession for his own sexual gratification.'

Article text: A tumour growing inside of Amanda Murphy caused a headache so severe that it drove her to stab herself in the head with a knife to try and relieve the pain. What is even more shocking is that surgeons found hair and teeth inside her tumour when they removed it from her right ovary. Amanda's ordeal started three days before Christmas when she went to work with a blistering headache. Amanda Murphy, from Rutherford in New South Wales, was struck down with a headache just before Christmas . A tumour found in ovary caused her to stab herself in the head and go into a psychosis. Amanda's (left) sister, Rachael (right), had to watch her sister go through the ordeal . As the day wore on and the pain did not go away, Amanda, from Rutherford in New South Wales, texted her sister - Rachael - who told her to go to the sick bay. When Rachael, 27, visited her later in the day, she became concerned when Amanda complained there was 'something in my head' and she needed to get it out. The 27-year-old told that's life! Amanda's forehead did look swollen so she took her to hospital, where doctors did some tests and found nothing wrong with her. They sent the sisters back home with painkillers for Amanda - who is a mine truck driver - to take. But her condition did not improve. The 28-year-old spent the next two days in an agitated state, with her boyfriend - Nathan - reporting she could not sleep. On Christmas Day, Rachael told Daily Mail Australia her father had left messages to say her sister had been re-admitted to hospital. It took specialists weeks to diagnose Amanda's condition, which caused her to experience mood swings . Amanda before the tumour took over her body and drove her to take up a knife and stab herself in the head to relieve the pressure of her headache . Frantically, she rushed to be at her sister's bedside but nothing prepared her for what she would see when she walked into Amanda's room. 'She had blood on top of her head, she was strapped to the bed and rocking back forth while they were trying to do the lumbar puncture,' Rachael said. The condition mostly affects young women who end up in being misdiagnosed and are admitted into psychiatric care or display behaviour so erratic they are kept in intensive care, according to the ABC. The tumour found on the ovary is named a teratoma, which could possibly have teeth, hair or brain tissue. This tricks the body's immune system into attacking the brain. Her father told Rachael that Amanda had tried to stab herself in the head with a knife. 'She was so distraught about the pressure on her head that she had tried sucking it out with a vacuum prior to doing it with a knife,' Rachael told Daily Mail Australia. The situation had escalated so much that the police had to be called to calm Amanda down before she was taken to hospital. When the tests from the lumbar puncture came back, doctors diagnosed her with encephalitis. Encephalitis happens when the brain becomes swollen and inflamed from a virus. But after days of treatment it was clear Amanda was not responding, falling into a psychosis where she did eat or sleep. Surgeons found an 8cm tumour on Amanda's right ovary, which had hair and teeth inside it . Amanda and partner Nathan who stayed with her throughout the ordeal in hospital . One time Rachael fed her sister water and she spat it out at her. Amanda would also throw abuse at her loved ones and hospital staff. Things got so bad that Amanda was transferred to the psychiatric ward at Sydney's Mater Hospital where she could be supervised by a nurse 24 hours a day. Her behaviour became increasingly worse, to the point where she was yelling and being aggressive towards Rachael and staff, but in the next moment she was staring into space. Before her illness, Rachael described her sister as 'very outgoing'. 'She was always the one to have a comeback. She was very cheeky,' Rachael told Daily Mail Australia. '[She] was a completely different [person], it wasn't her at all.' For weeks, Amanda's condition had specialists puzzled but finally they got their answer. After performing an ultrasound on her abdomen, doctors found a benign tumour on her right ovary containing brain matter, which was causing the immune system to attack her brain. One nurse likened it to 'a monster growing inside' of Amanda. Her condition, ovarian teratoma encephalitis, is believed to only affect one in seven people. Surgeons removed the 8cm tumour on her ovary, but there was another surprise inside it - hair and teeth. But it was a long road to recovery for the truck driver who spent another two months in hospital and went through a brain-injury rehabilitation clinic. Amanda told Daily Mail Australia she had no memory of the weeks she was affected by her tumour. 'I don't remember anything from first week of hospital to nearly the February after that,' she said. 'I don’t remember waking up until mid-February. That was when I was able to think on my own.' Despite the months that have passed, Rachael thinks her sister is still not back to the Amanda she knew. 'She's not Amanda she was prior to getting sick. She's not 100 per cent I don't think.' For more real life stories, see this week’s issue of that’s life! magazine, on sale now.

The BA flight to Dubai returned to London due to a foul odour emanating from an overflowing toilet, and three passengers have since filed claims for compensation due to the travel disruption. They argue they are entitled to hundreds of pounds each after cabin crew were unable to fix the problem and the flight turned around near Brussels. A British Airways captain told passengers the smell was from 'liquid faecal excrement' in a toilet . Passengers were initially told that they would board another flight in three hours, but it turned into a 15-hour delay. Three passengers have contacted Claim4Flights.com to seek up to €600 each (£450) in compensation, the maximum allowed for a delay of more than four hours when travelling over 2,200 miles as stipulated by EU rules. If all 200 passengers on board the flight were to claim, BA could be forced into paying out up to£90,000. One claimant is Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev, who was travelling to Dubai with his pregnant wife and two-year-old daughter. At the time he took to Twitter to explain how a 'smelly poo in the toilet' had forced the plane to turn back and land at Heathrow. Tory councillor Abhishek Sachdev was travelling with his pregnant wife and their two-year-old daughter . Hertsmere councillor Abhishek Sachdev said passengers were told that crew could not fix the problem . Speaking to MailOnline Travel Mr Sachdev, a Tory councillor, said: 'We had booked a night flight to allow my two-and-and-half-year-old daughter to sleep. 'Initially we were told that the delay would be three hours until another flight. When we landed, the pilot said it would be a 15-hour delay, until 1pm the next day. A smell emanating from the toilet on a BA flight forced the plane to turn back (file photo) 'This meant we lost a whole day of our holiday, and that we also had the stress of travelling on a daytime flight with our toddler daughter.' Mr Sachdev decided to lodge a claim with Claim4Flights.com after being unimpressed with how BA officials dealt with the situation. 'At the baggage collection area, we were told by some BA staff to queue for information. After 15 minutes in that queue, we were then told there was no need to do so, and were given a leaflet,' he added. 'This leaflet simply said BA apologised for the technical fault, even though the pilot was clear that there was no technical fault. 'We then had to wait 25 minutes to get our accommodation and food voucher. About five or six staff were trying to print these for us but couldn't because of system problems they said. 'This was now midnight and we had pleaded with them to hurry up but it still took a long time to resolve. Then we got to the hotel, and had to wait another 25 minutes to check in.' A British Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel at the time that they were 'sorry for the discomfort' of the passengers. David Williams, director for Claim4Flights.com told MailOnline Travel: 'We are exploring the circumstances against the Regulation 261/2004 set by the European Parliament which dictates when passengers are entitled to claim compensation for delayed or cancelled flights. 'If the circumstances are such that the delay to the flight was within the control of British Airways then each passenger on the flight could be entitled up to €600 compensation, assuming there were 200 passengers on the flight then this could cost British Airways €120,000 in compensation.' British Airways have told MailOnline Travel that they 'will assess any claims and respond accordingly'.

Article text: Chris Ramsey feels he was right to take his Queens Park Rangers players to Dubai for warm-weather training and is adamant the trip was not a holiday. The relegation-threatened Barclays Premier League club stayed in the luxury five-star Meydan Hotel as they took advantage of a weekend off due to Tottenham Hotspur’s Capital One Cup final by travelling to the United Arab Emirates for a five-day break. Ramsey set ground rules ahead of the training camp at the plush Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex but allowed his players time off to visit Dubai’s Meydan Racecourse to wind down. QPR boss Chris Ramsey spoke to the media ahead of Wednesday's Premier League match against Arsenal . The Hoops head coach was adamant that his decision to take his players to Dubai was 'the right thing to do' QPR welcome Champions League-chasing Arsenal to Loftus Road on Wednesday having won just one of their last nine Premier League matches following their latest defeat against Hull City on February 21. Yet Ramsey feels his team are better equipped to fight relegation to the Championship following their time spent in Dubai. ‘Whatever happens, at that time I feel it was the right thing to do, whether things work out positively or not,’ Ramsey said. ‘I still believe that it was the right thing to do for the players so we could actually sit down, have a few meetings, and have a chat, and see where we’re headed. ‘We worked on a few things. No rocket science. The players knew what they were out there for. One of the things we wanted to avoid was people thinking that this was a reward for something. It’s not a reward. It’s not a holiday. It’s a training camp. ‘If we could have had the training camp down the road it would have been more convenient. We set down ground rules, we knew what we were going there for.’ Ramsey will be without suspended captain Joey Barton after he was sent off for shoving Hull’s Alex Bruce before aiming to hit Tom Huddlestone in the groin less than a fortnight ago. The QPR manager does not want Barton to stop being himself but reminded the 32-year-old there are limits. ‘We’ve sat down and had a chat, and he realises that he could have probably dealt with the situation slightly different,’ Ramsey added. ‘The thing is there are players that do have disciplinary records. I would not want to stop him from being that fiery character that he is, but obviously we know there are boundaries.’ Nedum Onuoha, Mauricio Isla and Sandro have returned to training following injuries and are in contention to face Arsenal.

Article text: Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet admits Liverpool's improved defensive resilience is making life a little easier for them and instilling confidence throughout the side. A 2-0 victory over struggling Burnley - which the Belgium goalkeeper stressed was just as important as Sunday's win over high-flying Manchester City - saw the Reds record their sixth clean sheet in eight Premier League matches. They have now not lost in 12 league games, picking up 30 points, and have won seven of the last eight. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet (left) believes the team's improved defence helped confidence to grow . Mignolet kept another clean sheet against Burnley on Wednesday and has been pleased with his form . Jordan Henderson (third left) struck Liverpool's first goal from the edge of the area in the first half at Anfield . Liverpool were not seriously tested by the second-bottom visitors at Anfield on Wednesday night but Mignolet said that should not detract from the defensive work being done by the side. 'I think we defended really well. We were very organised and we didn't give too many things away,' he said. 'A clean sheet is nice and I am happy with how things are going but we all have to keep improving and keep looking forward. 'We're doing our jobs at the moment and we have to keep that going until the end of the season because it makes it easier for us to win games. 'Even at half-time, when it was 1-0, we were saying that we had to keep going because one goal can change the whole game. 'We wanted to make sure we didn't give any silly goals away. We kept calm and defended well and then we got that second goal, which makes things a little bit easier for us at the end. 'Teams likes Man City and Chelsea lost points against Burnley at home so we needed to get three points, otherwise that win over Man City would have meant nothing. 'So six points out of six was what we wanted, and we can move forward and we need to keep going like this until the end of the season.' Stand-in captain Jordan Henderson opened the scoring for the second successive game and the 24-year-old is growing into the senior midfielder role in the absence of Steven Gerrard, who returned to training this week after a hamstring injury. Gerrard leaves for Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer and Henderson, as current vice-captain, is favourite to assume the armband on a permanent basis. Henderson (left) has been filling in as captain in the absence of Steve Gerrard through injury . Gerrard (centre) is back in training but will leave Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the season . Daniel Sturridge (right) headed in Liverpool's second goal in the game against Burnley on Wednesday . 'Jordan is a massive player for us,' said Mignolet. 'He is a very positive character who always works hard and leads by example. 'He's vocal both on the pitch and in the dressing room. He goes in front of us and everyone follows behind. 'We've got a young squad but that doesn't mean there aren't leaders in the team. 'Every individual is contributing to the team. The big thing for us is we're a unit and we're working well together. 'But individuals score goals and at the moment it's Jordan, Philippe (Coutinho) and Studge (Daniel Sturridge) doing the business for us.' Liverpool have not lost in the 13 matches Henderson has started as captain, with an incredible record of eight Premier League wins out of nine. He made his 200th league appearance in the win over Burnley but admits his record as skipper is of less interest to him. Mignolet also praised the recent form shown by attacking midfielder Philippe Coutinho (right) Liverpool have not lost when Henderson (right) has been captain during the course of this season . 'The 200 games means I'm getting a bit older - which is not nice - but the captain one doesn't make any difference to me,' Henderson told liverpoolfc.com. 'I just try to do what I always do and lead by example, whether I'm captain or not, and so does everyone else. 'The performance and the points are the most important thing - I'll let everyone else look at the stats.'
