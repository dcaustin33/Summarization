Article text: These horrific images show the squalid conditions inside a fly-infested, dirt-ridden home where a five year-old boy was neglected so badly that he did not know what a bath was for. The youngster had endured such a miserable upbringing that he told his foster carer that 'Santa' had stopped coming to visit his house, even though he had 'been good'. Today, as his mother and her partner were spared jail for child cruelty, images from inside the family's council house in York reveal the 'unimaginable filth' in which the child was forced to live. Squalor: These horrific images show the squalid conditions inside a fly-infested, dirt-ridden home where a five year-old boy was neglected so badly that he did not know what a bath was for . 'Unimaginable filth': Police found piled-up dirty crockery and rotten food strewn across the  house in York . 'Unkempt': The council house's lounge contained a double bed that was covered in dog hair, dirt and clothes . Rubbish and rotting food can be seen littered around the filthy home, while every work surface in the kitchen is covered in dirty crockery or moldy food. Amid a stench of rotten food wafting through the property, there was also an abundance of insects and flies which swamped the tiny, cramped rooms. Shockingly, dog faeces, dog hair and clothing were also found strewn across the house, including on the carpet, the doors and even on a double bed, which had been set up in the living room. Among the chaos was a filthy mug, with the words 'top daddy' ironically emblazoned across the front. Authorities had been alerted to the boy's plight after he escaped from the house and his frantic mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang the police. He was later found a mile from his council house in York and told police he had 'woken up and looked around the house and nobody was home'. York Crown Court had heard how police then visited the house and found it in unimaginable filth with every surfaced piled high with dirty dishes. Filthy: Officers discovered the mess after the boy escaped from the house and his mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, rang the police. He was found wandering alone, a mile from the home . Chaos: The living room was packed full of boxes, plastic bags and a haphazard toy book, full of broken toys . 'Top daddy': Ironically, police found a filthy mug languishing in the living room, with the words 'top daddy' emblazoned on the side . It emerged that foster carers had found several of his baby teeth had their roots exposed with abscesses while six had to be removed. There was no toothbrush suitable for his use in his house. Prosecutor Aisha Wadoodi said: 'Every work surface in the kitchen was covered in dirty crockery and rotting food. There was only rotting food in the fridge. 'The floor was covered in dog hair and clothing. The back yard was covered in dog excrement. The lounge contained a double bed that was covered in dog hair and dirt. 'The property was very dirty and unkempt. There was an odour of stale and rotting food and a lot of insects and flies flying about everywhere.' She said it later emerged the little boy didn not know what a bath was for or how to be washed. The boy's 43-year-old mother (left) and her partner, 42, (right), whose faces have been obscured by MailOnline for legal reasons, were spared jail despite admitting two charges of child cruelty . 'Very serious neglect': There was also said to be a stench of stale, rotten food, wafting through the home . Concerns: Sentencing, the judge said he had 'grave concerns' about the couple's failure to accept help . Ms Wadoodi added: 'The foster carer reported that when she first gave him a bath he seemed very frightened and she also observed that he had wax coming out of his ears. 'He showed considerable discomfort while eating. He told his foster carer that Santa doesn't come to his house.' The court heard how the boy's school contacted the mother in 2013 expressing concerns about his hygiene and tiredness. Although this temporarily improved, the court heard how his hygiene then spiralled again towards the end of the academic year. The prosecutor added that, months down the line, his foster mother now describes the child as 'a lovely little boy, very chatty, open and likes to please people'. Grime: This close-up picture of the kitchen shows rust, dirt and grease lining the appliances . Victoria Smith-Swain, for the 43 year-old mother, said she had a long history of depression which she described as 'forty years of baggage surrounding her childhood'. The woman and her 42-year-old partner admitted two charges of child cruelty but were spared jailed. Sentencing them at Leeds Crown Court, Judge Rodney Jameson QC described the case as 'very unhappy' and involved 'very serious' child neglect. He said: 'It is almost inconceivable you let yourself and your child live in this squalor without some psychiatric difficulty. 'You knew the problems that you had and were offered help but didn't take it. 'I have grave concerns about your failure to accept help. I find this a very worrying aspect of the case.' The mother was handed a 18-month prison sentence suspended for two years, while her partner was jailed for six months, also suspended for two years. The couple were also ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.

Article text: End in sight: Padge-Victoria Windslowe, 45, finished testifying Friday in her buttocks-injection murder . A transgender hip-hop artist finished testifying Friday in her buttocks-injection murder trial but not before she asked to say something more to the jury. Padge-Victoria Windslowe looked dejected when her lawyer quickly shut down her request. 'I wanted to say something from my heart,' Windslowe grumbled. The 45-year-old Windslowe testified for two and a half days about the 2011 death of a London dancer she injected with silicone at an airport hotel. ‘My client's not a murderer,’ defense lawyer David Rudenstein said in closing arguments Friday. ‘It's clear she gave butt injections to people. That doesn't make her guilty of third-degree murder or aggravated assault.’ Big-city doctors at the time were only first seeing patients injured by black-market silicone injections, but Windslowe had experienced only good results, he said. And he urged jurors to avoid bias about his client's lifestyle, which included her turn as ‘the Black Madam’ running an escort service; as a dominatrix in slickly-produced music videos; and as the faux surgeon ‘Lillian’ catering to strippers and fellow transgender women. ‘The case is not about lifestyle, about whether you ... personally disliked the defendant,’ Rudenstein said. ‘The people who saw my client came from a certain walk (of life). They weren't going to a medical office. They were going to a hotel room. They were all kind of in it (together).’ Prosecutors were set to give their closing arguments later on Friday. It is not clear if the six-man, six-woman jury will begin deliberations before the weekend. Windslowe complained of chest pains at the courthouse Monday as she prepared to return to the witness stand. She was released late Wednesday and back in custody at a Philadelphia prison where she has been held since her arrest in 2012. On trial: Windslowe (left), 45, has been charged with killing 20-year-old London dancer Claudia Aderotimi (right) The defendants proved to be a riveting witness during three days on the stand, claiming in her many colorful tangents that she crossed paths with rappers Kanye West and Nicki Minaj, model Amber Rose and Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and ex-mayor of Philadelphia. Windslowe bragged that clients, among them celebrities, chose her to perform silicone buttocks injections over licensed surgeons because of her deft work. But authorities believe Windslowe caused the death of Claudia Aderotimi in 2011 and injured several other women through shoddy silicone injections. She clashed with Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega who questioned why people like Rose and her friends would choose an unlicensed practitioner over a Los Angeles plastic surgeon. 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' Windslowe said in earlier testimony. Windslowe said she learned the lucrative buttocks injection business from doctors in Thailand and Ecuador — vaguely referred to as Dr. Morales, Dr. Chimchoke and Dr. Vu — who performed her sex-change surgeries. She said she has since performed thousands of the procedures on devoted clients including rappers, strippers and women in customer-service jobs, earning the name 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections.' On the stand Friday, Windslowe denied that she was on the run in the 18 months following Aderotimi's death, when Windslowe acknowledged that she changed addresses at least five times. Tragic death: Aderotimi died in 2011 after she was injected with low-grade silicone, which spread to the woman's lungs, liver and brain . She said she believed that investigators were still trying to find out why the woman died, given that so many of her other clients, she said, had no problems with the injections. 'If you wanted me, you would have come and got me,' Windslowe said. Aderotimi died after she was injected with low-grade silicone at Philadelphia airport hotel. Doctors have told jurors during the two-week trial that the syringe hit a vein and sent silicone to the woman's lungs, liver and brain. Two other women testified they spent months in the hospital with similar injuries after visits with Windslowe, including 23-year-old stripper Sherkeeia King, who received an injection on a dining room table at a 'pumping party' that sent her to the hospital vomiting blood. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison if convicted of third-degree murder in Aderotimi's death, and potentially more time for aggravated assault and practicing medicine without a license. Seedy side buisness: Windslowe said her nickname 'Black Madam' came from years spent running an escort service employing male, female and transgender sex workers . Big business: Although she was unlicensed, Windslowe charged about $1,000 to $2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested . She said she started doing body sculpting two decades ago to help transgender friends. Transgender women often want to plump up an indent in the side of the buttocks they call 'the boy pocket,' she said. Windslowe charged about $1,000 to $2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested. Some clients, including a pole dancer she discussed last Friday, saw her a half-dozen times.

Article text: The sobbing that cooks have endured while chopping onions in the kitchen could soon be a thing of the past. Scientists say they have managed produce a tear-free version of the vegetable thanks to cutting-edge technology. Japanese scientists disabled the production of the powerful substance that an onion releases as the knife slices into it, cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes. No more tears: Scientists say they have managed to disable the production of a powerful substance an onion releases as the knife slices into it, cutting down on the pungent fumes that bring tears to the eyes . In a press release, scientists said that the typical burning sensation of a raw onion was reduced too. The enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor (LF) synthase. When an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial S-oxide. This makes up the LF enzyme and is responsible for causing tears. This reaction also creates thiosulphinate, which creates the onion’s distinctive flavour. When an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial S-oxide (pictured left).

This reaction also creates thiosulphinate, which determines the onion’s flavour. During tests, scientists found that LF is formed in the presence of an enzyme called alliinase (AL), typically found in garlic, as well as Prencso. If any one of these three components in the reaction was omitted,  levels of LF dropped.

The company's researchers led by Shinsuke Imai won the Ig Nobel Prize - an award handed out to honour achievements organisers consider unintentionally funny - in 2013 for their discovery of the biochemical process behind how onions make people cry. Their research paper was published in the journal Nature in 2002. However, a spokesman said no decision had yet been made on whether they would commercialise their tear-free onions. Earlier this year, UK supermarket Asda began selling its Sweet Red onion which has 'lower pungency levels'. This results in a milder flavour and fewer tears. This particular onion was grown by farmer Alastair Findlay of Bedfordshire Growers and costs £1.

Article text: Hundreds of believers have flocked to a hillside in Colombia after a landslide revealed the face of Jesus. The 'miraculous' discovery was made in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, on Saturday. Since then police have had to be called in to control the crowds as believers from across the country have descended on the hill to witness the 'miracle.' Scroll down for video . Hundreds of visitors have flocked to a hillside in the San Francisco area of Putumayo, Colombia, after the face of Jesus appeared after a landslide . Now some local landowners are cashing in by charging visitors to view the holy image, according to a local newspaper. 'If you believe in Jesus, you will see your image,' Ximena Rosero Arango told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo after visiting the site to photograph the hillside. The image has also been making the rounds on social media since Saturday. But not everyone was impressed with the 'miracle'. There was some debate on social media whether it was the face of Jesus as one Twitter user Magui, under the handle ‏@AdasOz, said: 'Congratulations to those who can see the face of Jesus in landslide in Putumayo. 'I just see a mountain of earth surrounded by trees.' It certainly is not the first time that Jesus has turned up somewhere unexpected. The face of Christ has appeared on everything from Marmite lids, tacos and naan bread, to tree stumps and laundry. In 2012 the image of Jesus was discovered on a wall by a painter and decorator working on a house in Eldroth, near Austwick, North Yorkshire . Divine sign: The image of Jesus was found on a drainpipe, left, by nurse Alex Cotton in Coventry . In 2012, the son of God was discovered on a wall by a painter and decorator working on a house in Eldroth, near Austwick, North Yorkshire. Sam Dalby discovered the divine countenance on a roughly plastered section of wall. His face has also been spotted in household items and even stains. Nurse Alex Cotton, 38, found an image of Jesus in a drainpipe at her home in Coventry, West Midlands which was dubbed 'the Second plumbing'. Bank worker Toby Elles claimed he was saved by divine intervention when he woke to find a burning frying pan on his cooker. On further inspection of his singed bacon snack he also found the face of the Son of God burnt to the bottom of the pan. My mate: Jesus in the lid of a Marmite jar, left, and in a frying pan containing bacon which was on fire . They both thought it looked like the images of Jesus you see in paintings and on stained glass windows,' she said. In the U.S., Mary Jo Coady, a medical secretary from Massachusetts made a similar discovery burned on her iron while doing housework. The 44-year-old said the image immediately renewed her faith in God. Drinkers at the Tanners Hall pub in Darlington, County Durham, were stunned to see the face of Christ in the foil top of a Bulmers cider bottle. And mother-of-three Claire Allen, 36, found the Saviour's friendly features in the lid of a jar of Marmite which was smeared with the yeast-based spread. She said: 'I opened the Marmite jar and the lid caught my eye. Immediately I thought, that's Jesus. 'It wasn't a new jar, but I'd never noticed that before.' The face of Christ appears in a crumpled sock (left) while the image appears in a burnt on stain on an iron (right) Ms Allen, of Ystrad, Rhondda, South Wales, showed the lid to her older boys Jamie, 14, and Tomas, 11. 'They both thought it looked like the images of Jesus you see in paintings and on stained glass windows,' she said. Sarah Crane, from Orpington, was stunned when she hung her laundry out to dry and discovered the face of Jesus staring back at her from a crumpled sock. Miss Crane was so impressed by the clarity of the face she even built a shrine to the holy image. 'I'd left the washing out to dry overnight - and it had probably been sitting there a bit too long when I noticed the face in the sock,' she said. 'I called my boyfriend over straight away - we could both clearly see the face of Jesus in the sock. There is a straight-on face, and a side profile too - we couldn't believe it. 'We think it's a bit of a sign - but for what we don't know.' An image of  Jesus Christ also appeared on a tree stump in a Belfast cemetery. The tree, which was felled at Belfast City Cemetery in west Belfast, appeared to show the face of a bearded man resembling Jesus on the remaining stump beside a grave. While in Texas, a man found the holy image in the middle of breakfast and the revelation came in his bacon and egg taco. Ernesto Garza, 80, says he was busy munching away when he realised that Christ was staring back at him -- his face visible in the burn marks of the tortilla. It's a blessing from God,' Mr Garza told KTVB news. A Texan found a picture of Jesus in the middle of his breakfast bacon and egg taco which he was hoping to frame and save . Churchgoers in Russia began worshipping at a tree after this image of Jesus appeared in the bark . Mr Garzo was hoping to keep the taco and eventually figure out how to preserve it so he can frame it to hang on his wall. While in Russia, churchgoers have begun worshipping at a tree after claiming that religious icons with the faces of Jesus and the saints appeared on its trunk. The images began to appear on the birch tree in the village of Burmakino in central Russia's Kirov Oblast last month in the places where gardeners had trimmed off old branches. Villager Valentina Naumova explained: 'We thought nothing of it until the tree started to form these arched shapes, just like church icons. 'Then the faces of Jesus and his disciples began to appear in them and we realised this really must be God's work.' Now whole congregations of people gather in front of the tree to pray and give thanks.

Article text: A man who shook his two-year-old stepdaughter so violently she fell into a coma and died, has been charged with her murder. David Adams, 25, had been charged with assault and child endangerment in November after acknowledging having shaken Thaiya Spruill-Smith, according to the authorities. He had recently been released from prison after four when his family posted a bail bond but he was rearrested on Wednesday after the Brooklyn district attorney upgraded the charges against him, according to the New York Times. Yesterday he appeared in Brooklyn Criminal Court on a charge of second-degree murder. He hung his head during his 15 minute appearance. Assistant district attorney Frank DeGaetano said in court: 'He shook her several times. Thaiya Spruill-Smith, two, was taken off life support after suffering a brain hemorrhage. Stepfather David Adams, 25, has now been charged with her murder . 'He made her hit her head. She had multiple abrasions and contusions, 17 on her head, and she had damage to the axons and neurons in her brain consistent with massive brain damage.' Thaiya had been declared brain-dead in November after Adams said he shook her and she was admitted to a hospital with bleeding in the brain, retinal hemorrhaging and bruises. The incident leading to Thaiya's death occurred on November 12 when her mum Teoka Spruill left her Brooklyn apartment for about an hour, leaving Thaiya with Adams. According to a criminal complaint, Adams told police he held Thaiya off the ground, causing her head 'to rotate forward and back rapidly several times,' and the girl's body then went limp. He again shook her, so hard her head swiveled again several times, and then her body went rigid. Thaiya was asleep when Ms Spruill returned, she said, and the child woke once during the night to ask for juice. Ms Spruill called an ambulance next morning when she heard Thaiya struggling for breath. The youngster was rushed to Brookdale Hospital shortly before 7am and despite numerous operations, doctors concluded her injuries were too severe to overcome and she was eventually taken off life support. It has since emerged that Thaiya may have been the victim of months of abuse at the hands of Adams that was investigated by New York City social services. Ms Spruill and Thaiya's father Terrell Smith disagreed over whether to donate her organs after the toddler was declared brain dead two days after the incident. A judge ordered Brookdale  to keep the child on life support for at least another day to keep her organs alive until the girl's parents resolved their dispute. 'She was born with that, she's going to be buried with that, her body, her eyes - it's what makes her her,' Smith told the New York Times from Thaiya's hospital bed in Brookdale Hospital, New York. Thaiya's father Terrell Smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother's new husband . 'My daughter was born with that, and she's going to lie down with the same thing.' Speaking separately, Spruill told the paper: 'I just think it would be a blessing for someone else's family.' As organ and tissue donation can only occur when there is agreement among family members, it was eventually ruled Thaiya's organs would not be donated. The parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning Thaiya's lifetime, as Smith claims he made repeated attempts to save her from Adams, who he claims was abusive. Relatives made emotional tributes to the 'smart' and 'sweet' girl at the time of Adams' first appearance in court. 'Thai, she was like the sweetest little girl ever, like you wouldn't have problems with her ever,' Shayne Smith, Thaiya's uncle, told Time Warner Cable. 'She was very smart - very, very smart.' According to court documents, Adams admitted to shaking Thaiya when questioned. And police sources say there are records of a similar shaking incident in the household last month. At his first appearance Adams, who married Thaiya's mother in March, wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two-year-old had died. 'He was shocked. He was very, very upset,' defense attorney Joseph Sieger told the New York Post. Smith said social services took custody of the little girl for a week while they investigated Adams for abuse. She was returned and the case was dropped, he said. The ACS has refused to confirm or deny Smith's claims due to confidentiality restrictions.

Article text: A Navy SEAL who was shot 27 times and still managed to pull out his handgun and kill two enemy fighters is now training to run a half-Ironman triathlon in honor of his fellow veterans. Mike Day is representing Dallas-based Carrick Brain Centers, where he was treated for PTSD eight years after he survived a gunfight while serving in Iraq. In 2007 Day was hit 27 times by enemy fire after he was the first of his SEAL team to enter a room where four enemy fighters were waiting and quickly shot the rifle out of his hand. Scroll down for video . Former Navy SEAL Mike Day, who was shot 27 times during a gunfight in Iraq, is now training to run a half-Ironman triathlon in honor of his fellow veterans . During the attack 11 shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him. He was shot in both legs as arms, the buttocks and scrotum, as well as his abdomen. His thumb almost had to be amputated . Day managed to kill two enemy fighters with his pistol before he was knocked unconscious by a grenade that exploded less than 10-feet away from him. Eleven shots hit Day's body armor while the other 16 wounded him, according to WTKR. When Day woke up a minute later in the midst of a firefight, he grabbed his handgun and shot down two enemy fighters before the gunfire ceased. The tough SEAL then got up and walked himself to the medical helicopter. Day described the extent of his numerous injuries on his half-Ironman fundraiser page, writing that he was shot in both legs and arms, as well as the buttocks and scrotum. He said a shot to his abdomen also left him with a colostomy bag for a year, and his left thumb was almost amputated. Day said now his life's mission is to 'care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters' Day's ribs were also fractured and he suffered contusions to his lungs after his body armor was hit so many times, but the bullets missed all his vital organs. 'This was a single gunfight at an ordinary day at the office,' he wrote on the page. After spending 16 days in the hospital, where he lost 55 pounds, Day was discharged and awarded the Purple Heart.

Article text: The body of Frank Viggiano was laid to rest on Thursday in Linden, New Jersey, after the 28-year-old police officer was killed during a horrific car wreck in Staten Island last week. His fellow officer, Pedro Abad Jr., was driving the wrong way and smashed head-on into a truck during the crash which also killed Joseph Rodriguez, 28, and injured Linden officer Patrik Kudlac. Records show Abad, who is now conscious in the hospital, has had two DUI arrests in the last four years. Scroll down for video . Pallbearers carried the casket holding Linden Officer Frank Viggiano following funeral services in New Jersey . Police officers embraced following funeral services for Viggiano at Linden Presbyterian Church on Thursday . Viggiano was killed early on Friday, March 20, when the car he was in crashed head-on into a truck . Abad suffered two broken legs in the crash and he is recovering at Richmond University Medical Center in West Brighton, according to the Staten Island Advance. Frank Viggiano was killed in the crash on March 20 . The six-year Linden police veteran was arrested on a DUI charge in Roselle in 2011. That arrest apparently led to no citation or violation. Abad's license was suspended for seven months after a 2013 DUI arrest in Rahway a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission said earlier this week. Linden police didn't comment Thursday on why Abad remained on the force or say what sanctions he may have faced. Prior to the most recent crash, Abad posted photos of three whiskey shots on his Instagram account. Linden Mayor Derek Armstead said the Union County Prosecutor's Office is handling an investigation of the Linden Police Department, New Jersey Advance media reported. He said: 'We spoke to prosecutor's office yesterday. 'We basically are relying on the prosecutor's office to handle the investigation. We feel that they will do a complete and thorough job.' Armstead knew Viggiano and he spoke at the funeral. Officials issued a salute outside of Linden Presbyterian Church before funeral services for Viggiano began . Pedro Abad Jr. (pictured both) had eight accidents and two DUIs on his record before the Staten Island crash . Dozens of police and firefighters stood at attention as pallbearers brought the coffin into the church . Linden Mayor Derek Armstead said the prosecutor's office is investigating the Linden Police Department .

Article text: Looking lean and healthy and sporting something of a George Clooney look, Darren Clarke signed on for his first official engagement as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain. There are 550 days to go before Clarke takes his golfing monument men to Minnesota to try to bring back the trophy — and many of those days will be filled with the sort of media engagements that occupied his time at the Sofitel at Heathrow’s Terminal Five. No doubt Clarke may struggle for something to say on occasion but that was not the case here as he spoke about Rory McIlroy and other pertinent matters, including one surprising comment regarding the Ryder Cup. Darren Clarke will captain Europe at next year's Ryder Cup in Minneapolis . The former Open champion holds aloft the trophy on his first official appointment as captain . After the comprehensive win at Gleneagles last time in 2014, the overwhelming temptation must be to keep everything the same but Clarke is considering one small change to the blueprint. He plans to study the data on wildcards in the tournament before deciding whether to recommend cutting their number from three to two. Of course, there are arguments both ways. He might leave himself short of options if too many of the top players fail to qualify automatically but there is an equally compelling case for saying the man finishing in 10th spot deserves to make the team by right. Even this far out Clarke is unequivocal, however, about who will be the team leader — it just has to be McIlroy. Clarke has known the 25-year-old Ulsterman since before McIlroy was even a teenager. ‘Rory always was special as a kid and a golfer,’ said Clarke. ‘He was different from everyone else and still is.’ Clarke has backed his compatriot Rory McIlroy to complete his grand slam of all four majors . The world No 1 travels to Augusta in a fortnight needing only the Masters to complete his set . The skipper is excited to see how McIlroy fares at the Masters next month but is adamant about one thing: Rory will complete the career Grand Slam one day. ‘If he doesn’t win it this year, he will win it next year,’ he said. ‘He’s just too good not to win it, with all his gifts and on a course made for his game.’ What sort of captain will Clarke be? Given his emotional personality, it is hardly surprising he picks out the Ryder Cup ships run by Ian Woos-nam and Sam Torrance. ‘Sam once said to me that playing in the Ryder Cup is like having your first child, that you really can’t describe it until you’ve gone through it, and that’s always stuck with me,’ he said. ‘I was fortunate enough to experience the pressure of contending for a major and coming through to win, but for me the pressure of the Ryder Cup was far greater. ‘And I will be a player-friendly captain. Some might think I’m too close to the players but I will not shirk my responsibilities.’ Clarke is keen to foster that community feeling that marked Paul McGinley’s team in 2014 and one or two earlier incarnations. ‘It was interesting seeing that from the outside at Gleneagles,’ he said. ‘I was working for Sky but that togetherness was still so easy to see and clearly so beneficial.’ Players celebrate with former captain Paul McGinley after winning the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles last year . Clarke had a well-publicised falling out with McGinley but, thankfully, both are keen to present a united public front. ‘Of course I will be taking up his offer to talk with him,’ said Clarke. ‘Paul couldn’t have done a better job so it would be foolish not to talk. I intend to speak to all the captains. How can that not be a help?’ The first day in a new job can often be a nervous one but Clarke was composed and confident, and enjoyed some light-hearted football banter. After Sir Alex Ferguson’s motivational talk at Glen- eagles, would Clarke the Liverpool fan ask keen golfer Steven Gerrard to speak in Minneapolis, given he will be playing in America by then? ‘After yesterday, what a time to ask me that!’ he said. What price Tiger Woods pulling out of the Masters next week just as he did last year? Whatever happens, it is guaranteed already to be another sad landmark in his startling fall from grace. Now down to 96th in the world, Woods is certain next Monday to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since October 13, 1996. Tiger Woods is set to fall out of the top 100 for the first time since October 1996 . ‘I have a dislocated shoulder and it has been keeping me out of the gym, which is disappointing. I want to stay fit because . . . well, I shall be old one of these days.’ Arnold Palmer holding court as tournament host last week. Now 85, the great man promised that not even a dislocated shoulder would prevent him from hitting the ceremonial first tee shot at the Masters. In the words of the old Bob Dylan song, may he stay forever young. Arnold Palmer (right) presents Matt Every with the trophy after winning the Invitational in Orlando . There is a fine line separating Paul Casey in 49th place in the world rankings from Marc Warren in 51st but right now it is making a huge difference. One is heading to the Masters in a fortnight’s time while the other is not. That could all change, however, following the Valero Texas Open this week. Anyone inside the top 50 after this event will get an invitation to Augusta and while Warren has secured a prized sponsor’s invitation, Casey has decided to stay at home in Arizona. Paul Casey will be sweating on Marc Warren's performance at the Texas Open to find his Masters fate . What price Scotsman Warren, on a straight-shooter’s course that ought to suit his eye, tipping the Englishman out of the field for the season’s first major? It is to be hoped that both scrape in. Under the ranking system, Casey is actually projected to move up a spot without taking the week’s events into account (proceedings at the Trophee Hassan in Morocco on the European Tour could also influence matters). So not just Warren but two other players would have to go past Casey to deny him a Masters outing. As for Warren, anything resembling the tied-17th finish he achieved in his last start at Miami’s Cadillac Championship would do the trick. Among those who could also force their way to Augusta via their efforts in Morocco are Englishmen Andy Sullivan (61st) and Tommy Fleetwood (66th).

Article text: Thought the black and blue dress was an optical illusion? It's nothing compared to these mind-boggling pictures by a Swedish photographer, artist, and Photoshop genius. Erik Johansson, 30, who is based in Berlin, Germany, says he doesn’t capture moments, but instead captures ideas. He takes mundane scenarios, including houses, cars and streets and transforms them into optical illusions, which he describes as, 'surreal ideas realised in a realistic way with a touch of humour'. Scroll down for video . Swedish photographer, artist, and Photoshop genius, Erik Johansson, has created mind-boggling photos like this inside-out house that look different on each glance. In this image called The Architect the subject seems to be both inside and outside the house . Erik, born in Gotene, Sweden, who aims to challenge and perplex the viewer, uses his artistry to confuse people who look at his work. From  cars seemingly driving upside-down on bridges to spaces that, at a glance, appear to be a bedroom and then suddenly look like a field, his work is challenging, clever and full of subtle detail. Erik explains that he wants his work to evoke a problem-solving approach. Although one photo can consist of hundreds of different images merged into one, he always wants it to look like it could have snapped by a camera. He said: 'It’s the challenge: can I put this very weird idea in a photograph and make it look like it was just captured?' In a series of behind-the-scenes videos he gives an insight into his painstaking method. To make Landfall, a work of visual trickery that looks as though green fields - rather than water - are pouring over a cliff edge, he layered  235 separate images. He photographed the fields to provide the backdrop, then built a scale model of a house and landscape out of cardboard, which he covered in gloopy green paint and shot. He takes mundane scenarios and gives them a more interesting edge by flipping them on their head, like in Landfall . In Brain Games, a man is seen pulling aside the night sky as he would a curtain to reveal the dawn and green landscape before him . Using Photoshop, he turned the running paint into rolling fields and superimposed a photograph of a house on to the cardboard model, adding a photo of a water wheel to complete the fantastical and dramatic shot of a dreamy, bucolic landscape that seems to be falling over a cliff. On his website he writes: 'I get inspiration from all things around me. Anything from things I see in my daily life to other artist’s work and photography. I think it’s a lot about looking at the world from a different perspective. 'I think I get more inspiration from paintings rather than photos. But there are tons of inspiration online. Here are some websites and blogs I visit for inspiration.' He cites Rene Magritte, Salvador Dali and MC Escher as artistic influences. Each image can anything from a few weeks to years to create. Erik says each idea starts with a sketch and if he thinks it's good enough he will start planning how to do it. This image, entitled Don't Look Back, shows a woman walking down a winding road that's crumbling behind her every step . Is it a bedroom or a field? In Closing Out, interiors and exterior meld as one in this seemingly simple tableau . In the optical illusion Cover Up, a man is hiding his real view with a better, more idealised image on wallpaper which he hangs on a line . He said: 'Once I’ve come up with an idea that I think is good enough to realise I need to find the places I need to shoot to put the photo together. This can take anywhere between a few days to several months, sometimes years. 'This is the most important step as it defines the look and feel of the photo, it’s my raw material. This step also includes problem solving, how to make the reflections, materials etc realistic.' He then sets about collecting or creating all the aspects he needs to bring his vision to life. 'The final part is putting the photos together. This takes anything from a few days to several weeks. This is actually the easiest step, if I did a good job in the first and second step. 'This part is like a puzzle, I have all the pieces, I just need to put them together.' he said. Reverse Opposite is mind-bendig as, with an MC Escher drawing, the car seems both on and under the bridge at the same time . In Erik's description of this picture, called Cutting light, he describes it as 'the strongest light bulb there is. Cutting through wood, concrete and stone in just moments' This image is called Dreamwalking and  captures the state between dream world and reality . Although one photo can consist of lots of different images merged into one, he always wants it to look like it could have been captured as a whole picture. In Helping Fall, a woman is seen hoovering leaves off the tree to help the process along .

Article text: Alice Moffat received a parking ticket after leaving her car in front of her own family's driveway- despite displaying her visitor's badge . A driver was left furious after she received a parking ticket for pulling up outside her parents' home. Alice Moffat was  hit with the £25 fine after she parked her car across the driveway while visiting April and Steve Moffat at their house in Yeovil, Somerset. The 23-year-old, from Redhill, Surrey, had even placed the visitor's permit in the window just in case and left it overnight. But she was shocked when she returned to the car the next morning to find a traffic warden had slapped a ticket on the red Renault  because it was parked just centimetres outside a marked bay. Ms Moffat, whose family have lived in Yeovil for 15 years, said: 'I drove back to the family home late, and parked over my parents' drive as I almost always do when I know they are not needing to go out that night. 'Just to be on the safe side, I also put the visitors permit in my car - not that it really needs to be there as I'm over my parents' drive. 'My brother saw a parking warden looking at my car. He thought this was unusual so went out to see what was wrong. I was shocked to discover the parking warden was issuing me a ticket. 'My younger brother immediately asked why, he said 'the permit is in, it's my sisters car so we're allowed to park over our own drive' but the parking warden simply replied saying the car was 'outside of a marked bay. 'He meant my wheel was a fraction over the white line of the bay behind, but not obstructing anyone or any car.' Ms Moffat, an actuary, said she and her brother had tried to reason with the warden, and had offered the move the car immediately to no avail. 'The warden replied saying he had already printed the ticket so there was no point,' she added. The 23-year-old had parked in front of the drive in Yeovil, Somerset (pictured) but was given a fine after being told she had not parked in the correct bay . 'I nearly always park over my parents drive, I had a permit in my car to be sure it was okay, and if I was a few centimetres forward, it would not have affected anybody or any car. 'I am now left with fine to pay because my car was parked over my own family's driveway. 'I think this shows very clearly what all the national press are saying, councils in England are simply using parking fines as a 'cash cow'. 'They were going so by the book and they didn't use any common sense.' Alice added: 'I have spoken to neighbours who said they have had a similar problem with getting parking fines while parked just slightly over the white lines. 'It's just so frustrating for my family, as they have to pay for their resident and visitor parking permits. The £25 fine, issued by a Somerset County Council civil enforcement officer has since been cancelled . 'They pay their way, and don't expect their family to get fined for parking over their own property.' A penalty charge notice was issued by Somerset County Council, stating the car was 'not parked correctly within the markings of the bay or space. ' A Somerset County Council spokesman said the civil enforcement officer was correct to serve a penalty but yesterday confirmed the ticket had been cancelled. He said: 'Having reconsidered the comments by the driver we have exercised our discretion and given her the benefit of the doubt and the penalty has been cancelled.'

Article text: A former bodybuilder given just weeks to live after being diagnosed with cancer today blamed his 10,000-calorie a day diet and energy drink addiction for triggering the disease. Dean Wharmby was told he had just weeks to live in November after a large tumour was found on his liver. But he is still battling the disease five-and-a-half months later, thanks, he believes, to cutting out sugar and relying on natural remedies. It is a huge turn-around for the 39-year-old, who told MailOnline he turned to a diet of burgers, pizzas and bacon sandwiches - washed down with seven to eight cans of energy drink - to create the 'perfect' bodybuilder's physique. Scroll down for video . The former bodybuilder from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, ate 10,000 calories a day as he tried to get bigger . But Dean Wharmby now believes his high-protein, high-fat diet may be 'a contributing factor' which cause his illness. Pictured: Mr Wharmby before he go sick (left), and afterwards (right) Mr Wharmby was given three weeks to live by doctors in November but - after committing to a healthy diet, which completely cuts out sugar - he has lived for a further five-and-a-half months . But he now believes the high-protein, fatty diet he lived on for four to five years may have led to his illness, first diagnosed in 2010. 'It was because I was trying to be as big as possible,' Mr Wharmby told MailOnline. 'I can't say it was the diet for sure, but things like the energy drinks could be contributing factors. Red meats - all things we have found out have so many impurities in them now. 'I think it was a combination of it all.' Mr Wharmby had been a  bodybuilder for 20 years before he became ill. In the beginning, he admits to taking steroids for about a year to create his physique because 'everybody did it'. But he soon turned his back on them, as he began to build his personal training business. It was then his diet took a turn for the worse. 'I could train seven clients in a day, back-to-back,' he said. 'Then I would have to have the energy to train myself.' He added: 'I was constantly on the go.' Dean Wharmby was on a high-calorie diet for four to five years, as he tried to get make his body as big as possible. Here, he reveals what he ate during an average day. Breakfast: An entire pack of bacon, made into eight sandwiches and a protein shake 2,500 calories . Snack: A steak muffin (sandwich) 225 calories . Snack: Two sweet potatoes and a full chicken 1,190 calories . Snack: A protein shake 262 calories . Snack: Two protein bars 580 calories . Snack: Large McDonalds Quarter Pounder meal with a diet Coke 855 calories . Snack: Supermarket bought pizza - normally pepperoni 888 calories . Dinner: Chips or rice with three chicken breasts or a steak 783 calories . Snack: 400g of beef on its own 1,000 calories . Supper: 15 boiled eggs 1,170 calories . Snack: Protein shake 262 calories . Total: 9,715 calories a day . But that is not all: . Overnight, Dean used to wake up every two hours to eat either a full pack of Jaffa Cakes, a jar of peanut butter, or more protein bars - pushing him over the 10,000 calorie-a-day mark . Mr Wharmby said his hectic lifestyle meant he turned to fast food to get the calories he needed . Some days, he would see seven clients back-to-back - and would fit eating every two hours around them . Mr Wharmby found the energy from seven to eight cans of energy drink while eating every two hours. And while some of it was typical bodybuilder fare - protein shakes, eggs and chicken - other bits were less conventional. Mr Wharmby would grab a McDonalds for a snack, and a pizza on the way home - which he would eat while his girlfriend of five years cooked dinner. At his biggest, he was 20 stone. But then the personal trainer from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, became unwell five-and-a-half years ago, and doctors discovered a growth. Mr Wharmby and partner Charlotte Rigby (pictured) started to research natural medicine after his diagnosis . He was offered chemotherapy and a liver transplant, but he decided to turn both down in favour of natural remedies. 'I refused it from day one,' he said. 'The main reason why I chose to do natural instead of artificial was because I wanted to live. I didn't want to die.' But that meant he needed to completely rethink his diet, which was full of things like acids - which he believes help cancers thrive. And for a year, it was successful: Mr Wharmby's tumour disappeared. 'But I got complacent,' he admitted. 'The old lifestyle crept in again.' In 2013, he collapsed outside the gym where he was working as a trainer, and rushed to hospital. For the majority of the next year, he returned to his healthy regime. But then things started to go wrong: he broke up with his girlfriend briefly, and found himself homeless - making it hard to concentrate on getting better. By November, he was in hospital 'hooked up to every machine you could think of'. Doctors said he had just three weeks to live. The tumour had got too big to operate, and there was little the doctors felt they could do. 'I was offered chemotherapy, but doctors basically said there was no point,' Mr Wharmby said. Mr Wharmby, at his heaviest, weighed 20 stone - something he admits was also not good for his body . Mr Wharmby and Miss Rigby, who have been together for five years, hope to inspire others with his new diet . It is not known exactly what causes liver cancer, but research has suggested diet could be a factor. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - which is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes - has been linked to cases of liver cancer. The disease occurs when small deposits of fat build up in the tissue. But while it is a common condition, in some cases, with people who have high levels of fat the liver can become inflamed. This can scar the liver over time - causing cirrhosis, which is linked to many cases of liver cancer. Energy drinks, meanwhile, have been linked to cases of bowel cancer by scientists in Scotland, according to The Scotsman.  It was also reported earlier this year that some energy drinks have as many as 20 teaspoons of sugar in them. Sources: NHS Choices . So he and girlfriend Charlotte Rigby - his 'rock' - began his healthy regime once more. They also began fundraising to help pay for the treatment costs and have attracted more than 2,000 likes on Facebook by regularly posting videos of his progress. He has also visited a doctor in London - and is hoping to shrink his tumour by using natural medicine. Mr Wharmby is also hoping to inspire others through social media to live more healthily. Ms Rigby, 27, said: 'There are lots of examples out there of people beating cancer naturally, even when they've been told there's nothing conventional medicine can do for them. 'The support Dean has received has really lifted him. People have been so positive and it has really made a difference to his attitude. 'Now he's determined to inspire others to live more healthily.' Mr Wharmby added: 'It has been very difficult but I'm 100 per cent determined to beat this. 'And five-and-a-half months later, I'm doing something right.'

Article text: Porto right-back Danilo admits he is proud to be linked with Real Madrid, as the European champions step up their interest in the Brazilian right-back. Although he insists he is fully focused on his current club, Danilo is 'ready' to sit down at the end of the season and discuss his future. 'I'm living a great moment with Porto,' he told Spanish newspaper AS. 'It makes me happy a great club like Madrid is interested in me. Danilo is currently on international duty with Brazil, and admits he is flattered by interest from Real Madrid . AS leads on Danilo's potential move to Madrid, while Mundo Deportivo focus on Gerard 'Piquembauer' Pique . 'When the season ends I'll sit down with Porto and we'll decide what is best for me and them.' The 23-year-old is currently on international duty with Brazil, alongside current Real Madrid defender Marcelo, who is likely to have an impact on Danilo's decision come the end of the season. AS report that it will cost Madrid €30million (£22m) to bring Danilo to the Bernabeu. Elsewhere in Spain, Mundo Deportivo's front page leads on Gerard Pique, and his comparison to Bayern Munich and Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer. Pique has made the centre-back position his own and is now Barcelona's leader at the heart of defence . Beckenbauer is widely regarded as one of the best defenders ever to have lived, and the Spanish paper have dubbed Pique 'Piquembauer' on their front page. 'The comeback', reads the headline, as Mundo claim Pique has taken on the challenge and is once again a world-class performer in his position. The 28-year-old has made 31 appearances in a Barcelona shirt so far this season, and has confirmed his inheritance of the leadership from Puyol at the Nou Camp, 'gaining weight' in the dressing room in the process. Marcello Lippi thinks Juventus can win the Champions League (left) while Michel Platini also has kind words . In Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport carry an interview with Marcello Lippi, two-time Juventus manager and World Cup-winning coach with Italy. He claims he can see himself in Massimiliano Allegri, the current Juve manager, and has backed him to win the Champions League this season. Lippi was in charge of the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006 despite being underdogs in Germany, and thinks Juve's situation in Europe is similar. 'In the Champions League he can do like Italy in 2006,' Lippi told La Gazzetta. 'We weren't favourites, but we won. Lippi can see himself in Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri (pictured) and has backed him to succeed . 'Max arrived at Juve at the same age I did, he has my pragmatism.' Tuttosport's front page leads on UEFA president Michel Platini, who also has some kind words for his former club Juve. Aside from the Champions League, they are top of Serie A by 14 points and in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia. Allegri's side fell to a 2-1 defeat at home to Fiorentina in the first leg of their semi-final, but Platini has backed them to make a comeback in the second leg on April 7. 'Juve, this time you can win the cup,' Platini said.

Article text: WHAT MORE DOES WAYNE HAVE TO DO . When Louis van Gaal said he needed a 20-goal-a-season striker, I almost laughed. Manchester United have spent huge money and now he is saying Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie or Radamel Falcao can’t score 20 goals? Do me a favour. Rooney issued the perfect response on Saturday. I still don’t know why Van Gaal insists on playing him in midfield. In his career Rooney averages 18.8 goals a season. At United that figure is 20.6 goals. Still not good enough, Louis? Even if he only meant league goals, Rooney still ranks highly. Thierry Henry, one of the deadliest strikers in Premier League history and my Sky colleague at Wembley on Sunday, only scored 20 league goals in a season five times. Wayne has done it twice. His Premier League average is 14.1 a season but Alan Shearer, the league’s leading goalscorer, averaged 18.6. Using Van Gaal’s maths, even Shearer couldn’t get into this United team… . Louis van Gaal's suggestion that he needs a 20-goal-a-season striker is laughable - he has Wayne Rooney . Rooney scores for Manchester United against Sunderland in their 2-0 win at Old Trafford on Saturday . THE BACK FOUR LOVE TO SCORE . It was not a vintage final, but Chelsea’s back four held the key to victory at Wembley. Last time they played Tottenham they conceded five. On Sunday they didn’t give them a sniff. Not only that but they were a threat at every set piece — Spurs looked fragile whenever John Terry and Co. went up. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify Jose Mourinho’s style: win at all costs. The Chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and were excellent at Wembley . HAMMERS MUST AVOID FLAT FINISH . It was a surprise to see a Sam Allardyce team concede three set-piece goals. They are normally well organised, but I wonder if Big Sam’s contract situation is affecting the players. It’s the chairmen’s prerogative not to talk deals until the summer, but if the players aren’t sure the manager will be there, they might wonder why they should keep playing for him. Alex Song in particular was poor on Saturday and after a fine season for the club, it would be a pity if it tailed off. Sam Allardyce needs to turn West Ham's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season . Peter Crouch has now scored 46 Premier League headers, equalling Alan Shearer’s record in the competition. PETER PERFECT . When I played alongside Peter Crouch at Southampton, I was laughed at for saying he was good enough for England. Crouch has spent his career fighting people’s perceptions, but there is no doubt he has made the absolute most of his abilities. He scored a fantastic header against Hull but, even at 6ft 7in, heading may not even be the best part of his game. He’s got a great touch, scored some fantastic goals — scissor kicks against Galatasaray, hat-tricks against Arsenal, volleys against Man City — and has enjoyed some memorable moments. Peter Crouch celebrates after scoring against Hull City during their Premier League clash . BRENDAN'S NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION . After that brilliant win over Man City, Liverpool are bang in the race for the top four. And here is a stat to prove it. In his three years in charge, Brendan Rodgers has lost just four league games after January 1. That is some record. Liverpool obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time. It helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to Champions League qualification this time round. They were excellent against City, with two world class goals, and they proved there is life after Steven Gerrard. With no Europa League football to distract them now, there’s no doubt Liverpool have what it takes to hunt down and catch Manchester United and Arsenal. Liverpool's players celebrate during their 2-1 win against Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday . MURRAY'S MOMENT . Glenn Murray was key in Crystal Palace’s promotion to the Premier League but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013-14 with injury. He spent the first half of this season on loan but at Upton Park he looked every inch a top-flight striker. His movement was good, he held the ball up well and though he was lucky with his first goal, his second was top class. Yes, he tainted his day with a silly red card, but he looked like he was loving every minute. He deserves it. Glenn Murray rises above the West Ham defence to score during Crystal Palace's win at Upton Park . SWANS FLYING UNDER MONK . When Swansea sold Wilfried Bony I feared for them, but Garry Monk’s team have continued as if nothing has happened. Their win at Burnley was scrappy but it was another three points and the club is in its best ever position after 27 games. Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup might be more ‘glamorous’ names but, as our table shows, Monk is outperforming both. I like the way his team plays, I admire his honesty and if Swansea keep it up, he will be more than justified in asking for extra investment in the summer. Swansea City manager Garry Monk has coped exceptionally well with the departure of Wilfried Bony . VILLA ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF SOME VICTORIES . In the last 10 seasons, the average number of points needed to stay up has been 36. This season it could be even lower. Either way, Aston Villa face an uphill struggle. Tim Sherwood’s side are 14 points shy of that average with 11 games left. They’ll need at least three or four wins but when they have won just five all season, and with away games at Manchester United, Tottenham, Manchester City and Southampton to come, that’s easier said than done. I think they will survive but Sherwood has to make the numbers add up. P.S. It was great to see Jonas Gutierrez back at Newcastle after his battles with testicular cancer and he got a fantastic reception. It’s exactly what he deserved. Jonas Gutierrez was back on the bench for Newcastle after recovering from testicular cancer .

Article text: Months after being labeled 'soft' by one of Australia's cricket greats and being dropped from Australia's test XI, Mitchell Starc has been deservedly voted the player of the World Cup. Starc's worth to the Australian team was never more evident than when he dismissed New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum in the first over of Sunday's final. The New Zealand innings never fully recovered and Australia went on to claim an emphatic seven-wicket victory. Few could have predicted the impact Starc would make at this tournament back in December when the left-arm swing bowler returned figures of 2-110 in the second Test against India in Brisbane, leading Shane Warne to describe Starc's body language as 'soft.' Australia seam bowler Mitchell Starc has been named man of the tournament at the Cricket World Cup . Starc celebrates after taking the wicket of New Zealand batsman Brendon McCullum in the final . The Australia team celebrate with the trophy after being crowned world champions in Melbourne . The 25-year-old Starc was subsequently dropped for the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the same venue where on Sunday he was named player of the tournament after using a new-found aggression to snare 22 wickets throughout the World Cup. 'I've worked really hard at it for a number of months now with (bowling coach) Craig McDermott in the background,' Starc said. 'A few series ago we sat down and found out a little plan and to see that come to fruition has been phenomenal.' He said his game-changing dismissal of McCullum off just the fifth ball of the final was part luck and part planning. Shane Warne, who had dismissed Starc as 'soft' before the tournament, poses with captain Michael Clarke . 'There was a lot of luck involved I think, but it was a little plan that Craig and I had going a couple of days ago,' he said. 'Brendon has been really fantastic through the whole tournament so I think there was a lot of luck involved. I'm just happy to get that one.' After a tournament notable for batting performances - including two double centuries, and teams regularly passing 300 runs, it was fitting that one of the few bowlers able to consistently make life difficult for the batsmen to win the coveted award. 'It was an amazing tournament and some outstanding performances,' Starc said. 'New Zealand has been a great team throughout the tournament and even set the benchmark, but I think we came hard today and (that) really led to this performance.' McCullum shakes hands with Clarke as Australia seal a seven wicket victory against New Zealand .

Article text: The two cross-dressing men who were shot outside the National Security Agency's headquarters on Monday had stolen the SUV they were driving from a hotel they had been partying at, it is claimed. Kevin Fleming, 20, and his friend were allegedly picked up in Baltimore, Maryland, by another man on Sunday night and driven to a hotel in Howard County, where they were said to have 'partied'. But the following morning, the unidentified driver woke up alone and discovered both the men and his Ford Escape SUV had gone, sources told ABC. He reported his vehicle stolen to county police. Shortly after, Fleming and his friend allegedly drove the SUV onto the grounds of the NSA and refused police commands to halt. They were subsequently shot by a guard outside the facility. Scroll down for videos . An NSA officer opened fire, killing one of the suspects and wounding a second during a shootout. A white sheet appears to cover a body outside the the SUV . The 44-year-old officer is pictured here being loaded into an ambulance following the harrowing shootout at one of the nation's most secure military installations . What appears to be a brown wig (circled, lower right) can be seen outside the stolen Ford SUV that the suspects were driving. The men were reportedly disguised as women . Fleming's friend, who is yet to be identified, was killed in shooting, the NSA said in a statement. Fleming was flown to hospital with serious injuries, while a NSA police officer was also wounded. It is unclear how the men ended up at the government building. The incident sparked terrorism fears at the heavily secured area on Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, on Monday morning. On Monday afternoon, authorities said that at Fleming and his friend were suspected robbers who were fleeing the scene of a carjacking nearby when they took a wrong turn off a highway. The men then panicked and refused police commands to stop when they strayed on to the highly secretive government property, police said. They were apparently warned several times to halt. When the SUV accelerated, the guard opened fire - killing one passenger and gravely wounding Fleming. The vehicle slammed into a police SUV blocking the road, injuring the officer, as well. The Washington Post reported that the shooting - which resulted in the president being briefed - was linked to the robbery at the Jessup hotel in the morning, less than five miles from the NSA. The NSA checkpoint where the shooting occurred is directly off the busy Highway 295 between Washington, DC, and Baltimore . This diagram shows where the shooting took place - just outside a gate at Fort Meade in Maryland . After stealing the SUV from outside the unidentified hotel, the suspects fled down Highway 295, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and ended up on Fort Meade, it is reported. As they drove through the gate of the NSA, they accelerated and would not stop, according to the NSA. As they sped through the checkpoint, they slammed into a police SUV. The officer who opened fire was injured in the process. During a later police search of the stolen black Ford, drugs and at least one gun were found in the vehicle, authorities said. It is unknown why the suspects were dressed as women, nor whether their attire was a disguise related to the alleged carjacking or something to with the 'partying' they had apparently done. The 44-year-old NSA police officer and the surviving suspect, 20, were both transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore,WTTG-TV reports. Chaos: A black Ford Escape SUV tried to ram through a secure gate near the NSA headquarters on Fort Meade in Maryland about 9am on Monday . A US official told NBC News that the incident appears to be a criminal matter, rather than an act of terrorism . Aerial footage from WRC-TV showed the injured officer being loaded into an ambulance. Other pictures from the scene show what appears to be a crash between the black Ford Escape and a police SUV outside the gates to the military post. A  body can be seen covered by a white sheet next to the black SUV. What appears to be a curly brown wig can be seen beside the SUV, as well . Fort Meade is home to several highly sensitive government agencies, including the NSA - the spy agency responsible for controversial mass surveillance programs - and the US military Cyber Command, which is responsible for military cyber-warfare and defense. The base is home to more than 11,000 military personnel and 29,000 civilian employees.

Article text: Rory Seager (pictured outside court) attempted to rob the bookmakers by claiming the tin of pilchards he was carrying was a bomb . A hopeless robber has been spared jail after he tried to hold up a bookmaker's shop with a tin of pilchards. Rory Seager, 18, owed a friend £1,800 and spent the day ploughing his last pennies into roulette machines hoping to win the money until he was down to his last pound. The 6ft 4in teenager then hit upon a plan to rob the bookies, where he was a regular customer. He bought a 99p tin of John West pilchards from his local corner shop and burst into a William Hill in Ilford, Essex, on 20 December last year. Seager demanded cash and claimed the tin of fish in tomato sauce he had in a black bag was a lethal explosive device, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. 'I've got a bomb,' he told astonished cashier Adeyemi Awomudu, who simply walked off into a secure room at the back of the shop. Seager hurled his fishy snack across the shop in frustration and left. Mr Awomudu had recognised him and Seager was arrested shortly afterwards, confessing to his bungled plan immediately at the police station. He admitted attempted robbery and one count of communicating false information about a bomb hoax. Edward Franklin, prosecuting, said: 'In respect of the bomb hoax, this wasn't a classic bomb hoax in that the security services weren't alerted and there's no evidence that any action was taken by the authorities. 'Both my learned friend and I agree that this is best dealt with as an attempted robbery - you can say you have a knife or a gun, in this case it was a tin of pilchards masquerading as a bomb.' Judge Karl King remarked: 'The thing that moved the man behind the counter to go behind the safe and into the secure room was undoubtedly the belief that the defendant had a bomb.' Caroline Carberry, defending, said Seager he had been suffering from diagnosed but untreated depression and psychosis at the time of the incident, and has Tourette's Syndrome. 'These are serious offences and I accept the custody threshold has been passed, and normally these types of offences would merit an immediate sentence of imprisonment.' She continued: 'He's far from someone who fits the profile of a robber of a small business, it's a great irony that Rory Seager went into a bookmaker somewhere he frequented, somewhere he was known - he knew the man behind the counter.' She added that Seager's own mother also works at a bookies, and the fact that he chose to rob a similar premises to his mother's indicated he 'hadn't given it much thought'. In a letter to the judge, Seager wrote: 'I just want the judge to know I need help and I will be an outstanding member of my community.' Ms Carberry added: 'This was entirely out of character, this was an aberration in this young man's life.' Seager was attempting to rob the William Hill in Ilford (pictured), which he had frequented as a customer . Sentencing Seager to a two-year suspended sentence, two year's supervision by the probation service and ordering him to undergo mental health treatment, Judge King said: 'There can be absolutely no doubt that what you did was to commit a very serious offence.' The court heard Seager threw the tin of pilchards across the shop in frustration when his plan to pretend it was a bomb failed . He added: 'One can only imagine how petrified he must have been. 'You secreted this item in a black bag, no doubt to give it a more convincing air to what you were doing.' He continued: 'You are young man suffering from a number of psychological conditions that had gone untreated, but you had got to the age of 18 without having descended into criminal activity. 'The disorders from which you suffered were long standing disorders and one can only commend members of your family for being able to cope for so long. 'It is in that context I have to decide how I want to deal with you, I'm satisfied that the custody threshold has been passed - what I am about to do is exceptional and does not reduce the gravity of your offence you committed. 'I am persuaded that I can suspend the sentence.' Judge King also barred him from an betting shop for the next 12 months and ordered him to pay a £100 surcharge. Seager, of Ilford, wiped away tears as his sentence was read out and thanked the judge before leaving the dock. One of Seager's family members shouted 'You are a just and a fair man your honour' as the judge left the bench.

Article text: Rob Biddulph's picture book Blown Away has won Waterstones Children's Book Prize . It took him almost five years to find a publisher, but last night Rob Biddulph's persistence paid off when his first children's book won a major award. Blown Away, the magazine art director's enchanting tale about a sky-faring penguin, won the £5,000 Waterstones Children's Book Prize. It is only the second time a picture book has triumphed during the award's 11-year history. Mr Biddulph, who works for The Observer, said last night: 'I'm totally surprised at winning. It took me a while to get this book published.' Melissa Cox, chairman of the judging panel, said the author had 'a beautiful fresh style all his own'. She said: 'The test of a good picture book is not how good it is on first reading, but how enjoyable it is on its fiftieth. 'It's a beautiful fresh style that is all his own and his style of storytelling is very reminiscent of classic picture book writers like Allan Ahlberg. 'It's very unusual for a brand new illustrator to write their own text, which marked it out, and even more unusual is for them to do rhyming text.' Mr Biddulph began as an author by making up stories for his three children and illustrating them. Blown Away was named the overall winner beating two other titles which had triumphed in their categories – Half Bad by Sally Green, the best teenage book, and Murder Most Unladylike by Robin Stevens, the best title for younger readers. Waterstones Managing director James Daunt said: 'This year we have another wonderfully inspiring Prize that is testament to the extraordinary vibrancy and creativity in children's publishing.' Penguins also captured the public imagination in the build-up to Christmas last year when the computer-generated Monty starred in the John Lewis ad campaign, with spin-off cuddly toys selling out. Sally Green (pictured) was crowned winner of the best book for teenagers with her debut Half Bad .
