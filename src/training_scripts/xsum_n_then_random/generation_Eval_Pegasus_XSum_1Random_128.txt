Article text: The largest numbers of children rescued were in San Francisco, Detroit, Milwaukee, Denver and New Orleans.
FBI assistant director Ronald Hosko said the Operation Cross Country VII raids had been the agency's largest action against child exploitation.
The FBI said 2,700 children have been rescued in such US raids since 2003.
The victims in the most recent raids were almost all girls and range in age from 13 to 17.
They had been prostituted in a variety of locations, including truck stops, casinos, motels as well as on social media and online advertisements.
Mr Hosko said the accused had preyed on vulnerable teenagers, exploiting them over a period of time.
"Girls are enticed with compliments or offers, [asked] do they want to make some money," he said.
"Then they are trapped into this cycle that involves drugs, that involves physical abuse

Article text: Liberal Democrat Robin Bradburn had lost his seat on Milton Keynes Council before details of Nadeem Ahmed Kiani's convictions emerged in August 2014.
But Milton Keynes Taxi Association said he should not have been selected as a candidate in Bradwell.
Mr Bradburn has refused to comment on his role in the affair.
The council revoked Kiani's licence last year after it was revealed he had been given a private hire licence by the licensing committee in 2011.
A second committee lifted a suspension on his licence in 2012, despite Thames Valley Police having written to the authority giving more details of Kiani's convictions for raping and assaulting prostitutes in London, in 1994.
Councillors Stuart Burke and Gladstone McKenzie resigned from the council's licensing committee as a result.  Labour's Mr McKenzie has also stood down from the council.
Subhan Shafiq, who had vouched for Kiani as a friend in 2011, resigned as mayor in August.  He then quit as a councillor when the council released a report into the affair in November.
Mr Bradburn had sat on both of the committees, before he lost his seat in the Bradwell ward in May 2014, three months before the scandal broke.
As a result, he escaped much of the media inquiries that followed.
When asked by the BBC if he would like to comment as to why he had allowed Kiani a licence, he said: "Not at the moment, no."
The council's report revealed Mr Bradburn told investigators "everyone is saying [Kiani] was a risk but he has not done anything in the 14 years since his release".
He also told the council he was "confident the right decisions were made.  So were the other members, but their leaders told them to apologise".
But Dennis Edwards, chairman of the taxi association said it was "unacceptable" Mr Bradburn was standing for election again.
He said: "What he did was appalling. Why would anyone want to vote for someone who put them at risk?"
Cari Mitchell, of the English Collective of Prostitutes, condemned Mr Bradburn's decision to give Kiani a taxi licence.
She said: "It is this blatant devaluing of sex workers lives which makes us vulnerable to violence."
Mr Bradburn will stand in Bradwell against Rachel Cadger from the Green Party, Conservative Max Chaudhry, Labour's Rachel Pallett, Katie Simpson from the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition and UKIP's Cathy Kitchiner.
Lib Dem Mr Burke is seeking re-election in Shenley Brook End ward, where he will stand against Labour's Binta Bah-Pokawa, Conservative Hiten Ganatra, the Green's Michael Gurner and Geoffrey Winter of UKIP.

Article text: The team tracked the health of nearly 800 villagers from the Chianti region of Italy to see if their local tipple had any discernable impact.
They found no proof that the wine ingredient resveratrol stops heart disease or prolongs life.
Experts say more research is needed to get a definitive answer.
The British Heart Foundation is carrying out its own resveratrol study.
Many studies have sought to explain why there is a low incidence of heart disease in France, despite many of its inhabitants eating a high-fat diet.
Some put it down to moderate drinking of red wine.
Studies have shown that consumption of red wine, dark chocolate and berries reduces inflammation, leading researchers to speculate that their common ingredient, resveratrol, explains why.
But Prof Richard Semba, of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and colleagues found no evidence for this.
They chose two small towns in Tuscany as their test ground, and 783 elderly people who were living there agreed to take part in their investigation.
The volunteers gave details about their daily diets as well as urine samples for measurement of their resveratrol intake.
During the nine years of the study, 268 of the men and women died, 174 developed heart disease and 34 got cancer.
But urinary resveratrol was not linked with death risk, heart disease risk or cancer risk.
Nor was it associated with any markers of inflammation in the blood, the researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.
Prof Semba said: "The thinking was that certain foods are good for you because they contain resveratrol

Article text: The move follows the case of a Thai surrogate mother who said an Australian couple rejected the baby she carried when they found he had Down's syndrome.
The couple, who took home the boy's twin sister, have strongly denied the claim.
Thai police say couples with surrogate children now need a court order before they can leave with the children.
Thailand's military government is rushing through a new law aimed at banning commercial surrogacy.
However, Australian surrogacy agencies believe there are more than 100 couples still awaiting the birth of children to surrogate mothers in Thailand.
A Thai immigration official told the BBC that one same-sex couple with a baby was stopped from leaving Bangkok airport on Thursday because they lacked documentation to prove they were the legal guardians.
Australian broadcaster ABC said three other couples were also believed to have been stopped from leaving Thailand with surrogate babies.
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Thailand has become the favoured destination for many Westerners seeking surrogate mothers.
But while commercial surrogacy is not technically illegal in Thailand, it does violate the code of the Medical Council which regulates doctors and hospitals, he adds.
Earlier this week, Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell denied that they had rejected baby Gammy, now seven months old, when it became clear he had Down's Syndrome.
They said that Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua, 21, had refused to hand him over and also threatened to keep his twin sister.
It also emerged that David Farnell had been convicted in the 1990s of multiple sex offences against young girls.
Mr Farnell insisted that Gammy's sister, Pipah, was not at risk of harm from him.
Ms Chanbua, who has two other children, said the couple had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the baby boy's condition.
She said she refused, as it was against her Buddhist beliefs.
David Farnell denied asking the mother to have an abortion and said that by the time they found out about the baby's condition, it was too late in the pregnancy to abort the foetus.

Article text: Others are sheltering from the hot midday sunshine, sitting under the thatched roof of a mud hut near the lake.
This quiet fishing village has been here for longer than any of its inhabitants have been alive.
Nobody seems to know when it was first established.
Its future, though, is much more uncertain, because oil has been discovered under Lake Albert, the large body of water that straddles the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Exploration work has already taken place, and full scale drilling is due to start within months.
"Things don't look so good for us, the fishing community," says Gideon Kaiza, one of the fishermen.
"There's a man who came here and told us they'll be relocating us to another place because of the oil business."
"They want only a few people to stay," he says.
The men do not know exactly who told them to leave, but insist they and their families do not want to go.
Initially they did not think they would have to, as one oil firm, Heritage Oil & Gas, built a brand new school at the far end of the village.
"We knew that whoever had a house here would be given money if the government chose to relocate them, so that they start a new, better life with their families," says Mr Kaiza.
"In Buliisa, when the exploration started, everyone got paid," he adds.
"But here, there's been nothing, and yet we fear we're going to be evicted."
As he speaks, cows and goats lie around under the shade of a huge tree in the centre of the village.
Children, dressed mainly in old clothes full of holes, sit by the water's edge.
An hour and a half's walk away, up a steep hill and then along an uneven dirt road, is the nearest small town, Weragaza.
The sound from a film being shown in the local video hall can be heard on the main street.
Some boys are playing pool on a table, under a rickety looking canopy made of palm leaves.
In the town's bar, the elected chairman of the district, Omuhereza Rwemera Mazirane, says no-one will be forced from their homes.
"The land belongs to the people," he says.
"Anything which will be done, will be done amicably; we shall be sitting around the table."
"They cannot be moved without compensation."
Weragaza is surrounded by forest, which is home to monkeys and baboons.
Some of the nearby land is used to grow crops.
Mr Mazirane says the townspeople should be making more use of that to increase their incomes once the oil drilling starts.
"We are always encouraging our people to plant more crops, to produce more animals for future consumption by the people who are going to work in the oil industry."
He seems less convinced there will be lots of jobs available in the oil companies themselves, although he says a handful of people he knows already have jobs guarding oil sites.
A three-hour drive away in Hoima, there is a much greater sense that people will benefit.
This is the closest big town to the oil fields, and its population is expanding at a fast pace.
On the edge of Hoima, a new guesthouse has just opened up.
Its owner, Trisa Kabaganda, apologises that she cannot show us any of her rooms.
She explains they are all occupied by men from Turkey, who are constructing a road towards the oil fields.
"This is the best place to open up a business."
"Hoima people have more of an advantage because it's the nearest town to the oil industry," she says.
"We are talking in the evening and are all of a sudden plunged into darkness as the power goes off.
"It happens every day," Ms Kabaganda says, adding that a nearby hydroelectric project is about to come online, thanks to the presence of oil companies.
"We are happy about that

Article text: A major crossing point is the Oresund strait bridge between Malmo in Sweden and the Danish capital Copenhagen, made famous by TV series The Bridge.
The checks have irritated commuters who travel daily between the two cities.
More than 163,000 asylum seekers arrived in Sweden in 2015 but that number fell to 29,000 last year.
The falling number of arrivals means the checks on buses, trains and ferries are no longer necessary, the government says.
But while ID checks at border points with Denmark are being scrapped, border controls elsewhere will continue to be tightened, it says.
Interior Minister Anders Ygeman also said more surveillance cameras would be used on the Oresund bridge, in addition to vehicle x-rays.
Meanwhile, the European Commission recommended that temporary border controls introduced in Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway during the migrant crisis be phased out in the next six months.
"The time has come to take the last concrete steps to gradually return to a normal functioning of the Schengen Area," EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told journalists, referring to the passport-free zone.
In November 2015, Sweden began allowing police to check people entering Sweden from other states in Schengen.
"The government's conclusion is that border controls are still needed and need to be strengthened," Mr Ygeman was quoted as saying by The Local news website, hours before the EU Commission's announcement.
The real story of 'The Bridge'
The measure mandating identity checks on passengers travelling between Denmark and Sweden by bus, train and ferry was last extended in February and expires on 4 May, with the government to let it lapse, Swedish media report.
An estimated 20,000 commuters daily cross the Oresund bridge.

Co-owner Tal Landsman, who is on trial accused of child cruelty, did nothing when he was informed, jurors at St Albans Crown Court heard.
Mr Landsman, 26, denies one charge of cruelty to a person under 16.
He is accused of the offence between 31 July and 7 August 2015.
Prosecutor Ann Evans told the jury Lewis had pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images.
Lewis has admitted three counts of making indecent images and one of taking indecent images.
On the first day of Mr Landsman's trial, LL Camps worker Sandra Vicente told the court Lewis, 26, had given her his phone and PIN so she could play music at a children's party on 1 August.
Afterwards, a colleague asked to look at some photos Lewis had taken of him, but she then clicked on the deleted images.

Article text: Twenty years ago today, Craig Brown's side faced England at Wembley at Euro 96 and encountered the kind of cruel fate that leaves a lasting regret.
Scotland were undone by misfortune and brilliance; two momentary interventions that extinguished their hopes. Within 90 seconds the ball was worked out towards Paul Gascoigne, who lobbed it over Hendry then caught it on the volley to score past his Rangers team-mate, Andy Goram.
"You've got to hold your hand up at times and say it was a great piece of skill," Hendry later recalled.
Gascoigne ran to the byline and lay on his back while England players sprayed water into his mouth, mimicking the dentist's chair drinking game that had been caught on camera in Hong Kong.

The midfielder was typically mercurial, since it was his birthday the England players had been out celebrating in Hong Kong. He had been quiet in the opening match, too, and the Scotland bench were convinced Venables was about to replace him before he scored.
The England boss understood Gascoigne better than most, though, having worked with him at Tottenham as well.
The night before the Scotland game, Gascogine couldn't sleep and visited Venables in his hotel room. He confessed to being worried that he would not be selected for the game, and Venables told him he wouldn't be.
Even with the player in tears, Venables left him thinking that for 45 minutes, before telling him he was playing and to get off to bed to sleep.
Some of the Scotland players left the pitch feeling they had let their country down, while for many of the England players it was relief that underpinned their joy.
They went on to defeat the Netherlands 4-1, but Patrick Kluivert's consolation goal for the Dutch 12 minutes before the end meant Scotland were knocked out on goals scored, despite both countries finishing on four points and with a goal difference of minus one.
England reached the semi-final, only to lose to Germany on penalties. Their defeat was overseen by Berti Vogts, who led his country to the title, and then six years later became manager of Scotland.

Officials did not give details about the sentence but said in a statement it included jail time.
Jason Rezaian, 39, has been detained in Iran for more than a year. The Post has dismissed the charges as absurd.
"In brief, it is a prison sentence," judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said in a statement on Iranian state TV.
He added that the verdict is "not finalised" - referring to an expected appeal.
Rezaian's lawyer, Leila Ahsan, told the Associated Press news agency she had not been informed of the verdict or the details of the sentence.
The foreign editor of the Washington Post, Douglas Jehl, said in a statement that Rezaian's "trial and sentence are a sham, and he should be released immediately". He added that the journalist had already spent 487 days in prison.
Rezaian, his wife, who is also a journalist, and two photojournalists were arrested in July 2014 in Iran. Rezaian was the only one of the group not to be released.
The Post's Tehran bureau chief since 2012, he was charged with espionage and distributing propaganda against the Islamic Republic.
He is a dual Iranian-American citizen and was tried in four hearings behind closed doors. He was convicted in October.
Earlier reports said Rezaian could face 10 to 20 years in prison.

The engine, which retired from service in 1963, has been restored for the NRM in a decade-long, £4.2m refit.
On Saturday it ventured on to the mainline network for the first time in 40 years as it took a test run through Cumbria and Lancashire.
Last month, the locomotive emerged into the East Lancashire Railway's Bury Bolton Street station after the final stages of the work at a nearby yard, thrilling hundreds of rail enthusiasts.
It is due to be painted in its new green livery on Wednesday and have its nameplates reattached before making its journey between London Kings Cross and York on 25 February.
Public services will begin later this month, alongside an exhibition at the museum.
Former fireman John Morgan, from Peterborough, said he was looking forward to seeing the Flying Scotsman steaming between the two cities again.
The 77-year-old became a fireman at 16 and worked on some of the most famous locomotives of the age, including the Flying Scotsman and the Mallard, the world's fastest steam train.

Leicester's Selby, runner-up in 2007, was 10-5 behind but won 10 of the next 12 frames for a 15-12 lead.
Five-time champion O'Sullivan, who had never lost a world final, reduced the deficit to 15-14, only for Selby to win the next three frames.
Age: 30
Nickname: The Jester from Leicester
Turned pro: 1999
Ranking titles: World Championship 2014, UK Championship 2012, Shanghai Masters 2011, Welsh Open 2008
Non-ranking titles: Masters 2008, 2010, 2013
His victory means he returns to the top of the world rankings and leaves O'Sullivan two behind Stephen Hendry's record tally of seven world titles.
Selby dedicated his win to his late father, who died when he was 16.
"To beat Ronnie in the final to win my first world title is a dream come true," he added:
O'Sullivan said: "I tried my hardest but he was just too good,"
Selby, 30, is £300,000 richer for his Crucible triumph and is the ninth player to win the Triple Crown, having won three Masters titles and a UK Championship.
Selby looked jaded on Sunday following his epic semi-final against Neil Robertson but managed to win the final two frames to stay within three of O'Sullivan, who wrapped up his last-four encounter against Barry Hawkins with a session to spare.
He then won five of the six frames in Monday's opening session to drag his rival into unfamiliar territory, O'Sullivan having never before trailed heading into the final session of a Crucible final.
Selby made breaks of 55, 52 and 74 - his highest of the match so far - to level the contest at 10-10 before winning a tense 21st frame to lead for the first time.
O'Sullivan retook the lead after the mid-session interval, winning an error-strewn frame courtesy of a run of 50, but missed a simple pink into the middle pocket to clinch the frame after deciding to play it with pace.
Selby duly cleared up before punching the air and ramming his cue into the ground in a mixture of relief and elation.

Eight frames were scheduled for the session but it was a measure of the attritional nature of the action that they could only fit six in before the interval.
O'Sullivan won the first frame of the evening session with a fluent break of 100, his third century of the match, to level at 12-12, but Selby won a 28-minute frame to restore his advantage before opening up a two-frame lead for the first time.
Selby compiled a break of 56 to increase his lead to three frames before the mid-session interval, his run of take 10 of the last 12 frames.
O'Sullivan started well after the restart, rattling in breaks of 30 and 49 to reduce the gap to two frames

Article text: The draft legislation seeks to protect sensitive personal data from hacking and government surveillance.
EU citizens are entitled to personal privacy and this extends to online communications, the committee argues.
A ban on "backdoors" into encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram is also being considered.
Encryption involves digitally scrambling a communication to protect its contents, and then using a digital key to reassemble the data.
End-to-end encryption means the company providing the service does not have access to the key, meaning it cannot "listen in" to what is being shared - giving the sender and recipient added confidence in the privacy of their conversation.
"The principle of confidentiality should apply to current and future means of communication, including calls, internet access, instant messaging applications, email, internet phone calls and personal messaging provided through social media," said a draft proposal from the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs.
The proposal seeks to amend Article Seven of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights to add online privacy and will require approval by the European Parliament and the European Council before it can be passed into law.
During the UK's recent election campaign, the Conservative Party said that tech firms should provide the authorities "access to information as required" to help combat online radicalisation, but ministers have also said they do not want to weaken encryption.
That has led to some confusion among tech industry leaders as to whether the government wants some kind of "backdoor", a way to have end-to-end encryption disabled in specific cases, or some other action.
However, cyber-security experts warn that criminals can still find a way to protect their communications, even if end-to-end encryption is banned.
"There are lots of existing techniques law enforcement can use," Dr Steven Murdoch, a cyber-security researcher in the department of computer science at University College London told the BBC News website.
"One of them is traffic analysis, which is looking at patterns of communications, eg who is talking to who, when and from what location.
"The other one is hacking - equipment interference in British law - which can happen before data is encrypted and after it's been decrypted, so there are still ways for law enforcement to gain access to information."
In the Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks, the perpetrators were already known to UK security services, Mr Murdoch added.
"They were not stopped because there were either insufficient resources or the resources were not sufficiently prioritised," he said.
"The suggestions being considered by the UK government would be worse for computer security

Article text: The facility is its second in Europe, after Brussels, and promises to provide faster access times to nearby clients.
Google is currently the third most capable cloud computing service provider, according to a recent study.
But the report, by Gartner, suggested Amazon and Microsoft had a clear lead.
The technology consultancy added that in terms of sales to the "cloud infrastructure as a service" market, Google's share was also a "distant third".
Until now, the search giant has focused on opening data centres for its cloud computing platform in the US and Asia, where it has bases in Singapore, Taiwan and Tokyo.
But in announcing the London centre, it also disclosed plans to open facilities in Finland, the Netherlands and Frankfurt.
"GCP [Google Cloud Platform] customers throughout the British Isles and Western Europe will see significant reductions in latency when they run their workloads in the London region," said product manager Dave Stiver, referring to processing delays caused by the distances data has to travel.
"In cities like London, Dublin, Edinburgh and Amsterdam, our performance testing shows 40% to 82% reductions in round-trip latency when serving customers from London compared with the Belgium region."
A spokeswoman for the company added that the decision to build a London centre had been taken before the Brexit vote and was therefore unrelated to speculation that the UK's data privacy laws may diverge from the EU's in the future.
Google's platform allows clients to offload data processing tasks and information storage, including support for apps they may offer to the public and analysing feedback gathered from internet-connected devices.
By charging customers for the amount of compute time they use rather than a flat rate, Google seeks to provide IT departments with a cheaper alternative to maintaining their own data centres.
The company's existing customers include the Telegraph newspaper, Coca-Cola and the online education service Khan Academy.
At present, GCP offers fewer features than Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, but it is catching up, according to Gartner.
"Google uses deep discounts and exceptionally flexible contracts to try to win projects from customers that are currently spending significant sums of money with cloud competitors," its June report said.
And that had led some companies to use Google to supplement their use of Amazon or Microsoft's rival platforms.
Gartner added: "GCP is increasingly chosen as a strategic alternative to AWS by customers whose businesses compete with Amazon."
Last month it emerged that Wal-Mart had urged its IT vendors not to use Amazon's service because it did not want its "most sensitive data..
