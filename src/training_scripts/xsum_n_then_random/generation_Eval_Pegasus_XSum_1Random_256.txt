Article text: Scotland's Information Commissioner has described proposed reforms to freedom of information law as setting a "worrying precedent".
Rosemary Agnew is due to give evidence to Holyrood's Finance Committee.
It is looking at changes to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill.
As part of the reforms, ministers want to give an "absolute" exemption to communications between the Scottish government and senior members of the royal family.
At the moment, information about the Royal Family can be published in Scotland if it passes a public interest test.
Ministers want to remove that test thereby banning any release and bringing the situation in Scotland into line with legislation in other parts of the UK.
The amendment would exempt communications with the monarch, the heir to the throne or a member of the royal household acting on their behalf.
But in her response to the proposed changes, Ms Agnew said: "The amendment will create a provision which requires absolute secrecy in relation to any aspect of communications with senior royals in all circumstances - regardless of how far removed the information is from the content of communications, or of the weight of the public interest in favour of release.
"It is my considered view that it will..

Article text: Michelle Rocks' baby was in a sideways position but Dr Rachel O'Flaherty advised a junior colleague not to admit her, an inquest heard.
Dr O'Flaherty apologised to Mrs Rocks and her husband Barry.
Cara Rocks was stillborn at Coleraine's Causeway Hospital on 26 June 2013.
The inquest is the first in Northern Ireland to focus on a stillbirth.
Dr O'Flaherty said she could not recall why she had decided not to admit the patient on 5 June 2013.
"I don't know what information I was given at that time and I honestly can't remember the reasoning behind that decision," she said.
When asked whether a Caesarean section would also have been offered, if it had been requested by Mrs Rocks at that time, Dr O'Flaherty said this would have been arranged.
Dr O'Flaherty first came into contact with Mrs Rocks at a hospital appointment when she was 36-weeks pregnant, Belfast Coroners Court heard on the third day of the hearing.
The doctor said that, in retrospect, she would have kept the patient in for observation.
Dr O'Flaherty apologised to Mr and Mrs Rocks and their family for the distress they have experienced.
The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has already admitted a number of mistakes played a part in the death of Cara Rocks.
These included wrongly categorising Michelle Rocks, who had a previous Caesarean section, as "low risk", incorrect recording of the baby's heart rate and delays in the decision to proceed to an emergency C-section because of time spent trying to locate a foetal heart beat.
The hearing continues.

Article text: Among them was Roberto Hernandez.
In a small, dank apartment in a rundown neighbourhood of Havana, I paid him a visit as he was reunited with his family and fellow government opponents.
He said his time in jail had only strengthened his resolve against the Castro government.
"My ideas won't budge," said Mr Hernandez. I'm more sure than ever about what I believe."
Mr Hernandez was jailed for five years, and served two, for taking part in a demonstration with the anti-government Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU).
But just as Roberto Hernandez was being released, another dissident was being detained - a graffiti artist called Danilo Maldonado, commonly known as "El Sexto", whose work is unrelentingly critical of the Cuban government.
On this occasion, the authorities decided he had gone too far: he had mocked the leaders of the revolution.
On 25 December 2014, he painted the names Fidel and Raul on two pigs and intended to release them in a plaza in Havana.
His idea was that people would try to catch the pigs and the winner could keep them.
Whether you see it as a cheap publicity stunt or a valid artistic expression, the event was never likely to be allowed to happen in Cuba.
Maldonado was stopped by state security officers before he got to the square and was put in jail, reportedly without trial.
The government say "El Sexto" is a mercenary in the pay of anti-Castro groups in Washington and Miami.
But Amnesty International recently deemed him a prisoner of conscience.
"To jail an artist for painting a name on a pig is ludicrous," said Carolina Jimenez, the organisation's Americas Deputy Director for research.
Now, there is some expectation that Maldonado might be released soon, after he spent days on hunger strike and US President Barack Obama apparently discussed his case in person with Cuban President Raul Castro earlier this year.
No official release date has yet been confirmed.
Either way, the Obama administration will hope he is out soon.
The arrest of what they consider seemingly harmless young opponents does not bolster their argument that engagement with Cuba is the right approach after decades of hostility.
"They're hoping that the Cubans will begin to ease up on human rights and open up politically. That would enormously helpful," says Michael Shifter, of the Inter-American Dialogue organisation  in Washington DC.
"It makes it more difficult for Obama to make his case with Congress on the embargo - which is that it should be lifted - when these kind of practices continue and there is really no sign of significant change so far."
The US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1959 after Fidel Castro and his brother Raul led a revolution toppling US-backed President Fulgencio Batista. The Castros established a revolutionary socialist state with close ties to the Soviet Union.
The following year, the US imposed a trade embargo covering nearly all exports to Cuba. This was expanded by President Kennedy into a full economic embargo that included stringent travel restrictions.
The embargo is estimated to have cost the Cuban economy more than $1.1trillion, and to cost the US economy $1.2bn a year.
In September, the US announced eased restrictions on business and travel with Cuba, the latest move by President Barack Obama to improve relations with the country.
US businesses will now be allowed to open up locations in Cuba.
Even small overtures by the Castro government towards dialogue with some of the more high-profile human rights activists would go a long way to helping Obama's position, says Mr Shifter.
But he also points out that even the sight of the Cuban government sitting at the negotiating table with the Ladies in White opposition movement or UNPACU activists would not be enough to appease those members of Congress staunchly opposed to lifting the embargo.
Some analysts believe they would "keep changing the goalposts" over human rights and would not back removing the embargo under any conditions.
None of this is necessarily a surprise to Washington.
Raul Castro indicated the one-party system in Cuba was not up for negotiation in his closing speech to parliament in December.
"We shouldn't expect that in order for relations to improve with the US, Cuba is renouncing the ideas for which we have fought for more than a century and for which our people have spilled so much blood and run such great risks," he told the deputies gathered in the chamber, as well as millions of ordinary Cubans watching at home.
Cuba did not not expect the US to change its political system, "so we demand that they respect ours", he said.
A new diplomatic relationship has begun and further economic easing could come with it.
But even if El Sexto is released soon, it is unlikely to herald any new political winds on the island.

Article text: The defence ministry had been told to develop plans for a "modest military industrial complex," the president, who came to power in May, said
Nigeria has been battling the militant Islamist group Boko Haram for the last six years.
The US has refused to sell arms to Nigeria citing human rights abuses.
President Buhari told a gathering of newly graduated military officers that Nigeria "must evolve viable mechanisms for near-self-sufficiency" in defence equipment that it usually imports.
On a visit to Washington last month, Mr Buhari said that the US had "aided and abetted" Boko Haram in the past by refusing to sell weapons to Nigeria.
A US law prevents the government from selling arms to countries which fail to tackle human rights abuses.
On Tuesday, a group of visiting US Congress members said Washington could lift its ban on shipping arms to Nigeria's military if the country improved its human rights record.
The US's stance has effectively stopped other Western countries from selling sophisticated military hardware to the country, the BBC's Bashir Sa'ad Abdullahi reports from the capital, Abuja.
Nigeria's only weapons factory in the northern city of Kaduna mainly produces rifles and civilian tools, Mr Buhari's spokesman Garba Shehu told the Reuters news agency.
He said that defence chiefs had now been asked to "re-engineer" it.
Boko Haram has killed some 10,000 people since 2009 and has also kidnapped hundreds of girls and women.
Last month, human rights group Amnesty International said that some 8,000 men and boys had died in Nigerian military custody after being detained as suspected militants.
The military rejected this allegation and Mr Buhari promised an investigation, although there have been no further details.

Article text: Bolton Wanderers legend Nat Lofthouse was absent from a plaque listing every England player's debut.
The FA was alerted by a Bolton fan shocked to see the "Lion of Vienna" missing from a pride of England stars.
Les Medley, who was a star of the "push and run" Tottenham team of the early 50s, was also missed out.
The FA has apologised to the families of both players.
"We appreciate this matter being brought to our attention and, following an investigation, have ascertained that it was due to a formatting error," said a spokesman.
"The panel is in the process of being taken down and will be replaced imminently"
The omission of England's sixth highest scorer, who netted 30 goals in 33 games, was spotted in the week when Wayne Rooney scored his 50th goal for England to break Sir Bobby Charlton's record.
Bolton's club historian Simon Marland said: "How can you miss a guy a who scored 30 goals in 33 games?"
"Anyone can make a mistake but on the positive side it's probably got people talking about Nat."
Lofthouse earned the nickname "The Lion of Vienna" because of his winning goal for England in 1952 against Austria following a run from the halfway line.

The victory means the Irish will face France in Sunday's final at the World League 2 tournament.
Wales will also make the final qualifiers in Johannesburg if they beat Scotland in the third place play-off.
Gareth Furlong put Wales ahead before Shane O'Donoghue, Ben Walker and Neal Glassey netted for the Irish.
Ireland, 10th in the world rankings, were strong favourites to account for the 34th-ranked Welsh but the visitors produced a strong challenge.
Furlong's early goal from a penalty corner left Wales ahead after the opening quarter but O'Donoghue and Walker struck in quick succession in the second quarter to give the hosts a half-time lead.
Wales had a couple of chances in the third quarter - including a missed penalty corner - before Glassey sealed Ireland's win by netting early in the final quarter.

Article text: The last two successful squads were happy to profit from their hosts' misfortune at crucial moments.
A celebrated error from the great David Campese got the 1989 vintage over the line in the decisive third Test in Australia.
The Lions have faced Australia in Brisbane on eight occasions and have won all of them.
Tom and Ben Youngs were the first brothers to play for the Lions in a Test match since Gavin and Scott Hastings in 1989.
Prop Alex Corbisiero gained more metres (30) in the first half than all of Australia's forwards combined (26).
Source: OptaJonny
In 1997 the Springboks scored three tries to none and battered the Lions for long periods in the second Test in Durban. In which case heaven help the players when we get to the championship rounds.
As in Pretoria, the Lions led for long periods before being pegged back towards the end. Again, the outcome was decided by the last kick of the game, only this time Kurtley Beale could not do what Morne Steyn did and break Lions' hearts, twice missing penalty chances to land the killer blow.
And again, the body count was huge. But it was Australia, rather than the Lions, who lost four players to injury and ended with others playing out of position.
While Gatland was adamant the Lions deserved victory, ultimately they got out of jail.
They found themselves on the wrong side of referee Chris Pollock at the start and end of the match, and so nearly paid for it.
Were it not for James O'Connor and Beale, who between them missed five kicks, and 14 points, the Wallabies could have won despite enjoying less possession and territory, and conceding 14 turnovers to the Lions' three.
The hosts were clinical, scoring two tries from three line breaks, both finished in style by Israel Folau on a highly promising Test debut.
But the Lions' wings were no slouches either. In the same city where Jason Robinson and Brian O'Driscoll dazzled 12 years ago, George North scored a sensational individual try to sit alongside those two in Lions folklore.
"When the ball dropped out of the sky my first thought was just to run," said the Welshman, who fielded Australia full-back Berrick Barnes' high kick, eluded the attempted tackles of Pat McCabe and O'Connor, then left Barnes for dead before evading the covering Will Genia. "I can't begin to tell you how good it felt when I crossed that line."
Nine minutes into the second half, Wales' other out-sized wing, Alex Cuthbert, was experiencing a similar sensation after surging onto Jonny Sexton's pass.
Yet while both showed their potency in attack, there were also lapses in defence. Tommy Bowe's return to fitness - he will be available for the second Test after coming through a contact training session - means Cuthbert's place could be under threat.
Manu Tuilagi is also set to be given a run in Tuesday's final midweek game against the Melbourne Rebels after recovering from a nerve problem in his neck.  If he comes through that, the Lions will be able to summon even greater firepower.
While prop Alex Corbisiero received treatment for a tight calf and will be further assessed, that was the extent of their injury concerns.
The Australians are already reeling. Berrick Barnes (jaw) and Pat McCabe (neck) must be regarded as doubtful starters next week, while Christian Leali'ifano was knocked out inside the first minute of his Test debut, and another centre, Adam Ashley-Cooper, was also forced off with a shoulder injury.
A backline reshuffle is inevitable, but one player who will definitely start is Beale. The late kicking lapses aside, he was a constant threat with his incisive running and probing passing after replacing Barnes at full-back. If he had started the game, it is easy to imagine a different outcome.
With O'Connor an unconvincing presence at fly-half, it would be no surprise if they swapped positions in Melbourne.
Where Australia's kicking failed them at critical junctures, the Lions had the reassuring right boot of Leigh Halfpenny, who nailed five out of six. That's 27 from 29 on tour now. It is a shock when he misses, whatever the distance or angle.
If the Wales full-back is one of the Lions trump cards, their line-out, a cause for concern at times on this tour, was another source of comfort to take into the next two weeks.
An immaculate return of 12 from 12 on their own ball reflected well on hooker Tom Youngs, even if a majority were safe throws to Jamie Heaslip or Tom Croft at the front.
Elsewhere, there were issues for Gatland and his coaches to ponder. The scrum was a mixed bag, getting the upper hand early on but faltering after the early removal of props Corbisiero and Adam Jones.
Losing their own ball at a scrum in front of Australia's posts, and then yielding the penalty that gave Beale the chance to win the game, will make for a grisly review.
The Lions' game management "wasn't as good as it should have been" either, according to Gatland, as they conceded penalties immediately after Cuthbert's try, and Halfpenny's final kick.
Defence coach Andy Farrell felt his charges hadn't trusted their system sufficiently. Or maybe they stopped trusting the referee to make the right call.
Brian O'Driscoll was clearly infuriated by twice being penalised for going off his feet early on, to the extent "he was afraid to go and compete after that because he felt there was a yellow card situation", Gatland said.
The breakdown was predictably ferocious, with Australia - and the impressive Ben Mowen in particular - successfully disrupting the speed of the Lions' ball, and scrum-half Mike Phillips.
Gatland is optimistic that with a different referee - South African Craig Joubert - next week, the Lions will have more success in "clearing away some of the defenders who are hanging around at the back of the ruck and causing a nuisance."
If they can find a solution to that problem, the Lions showed they have the guile - through Sexton and O'Driscoll - and firepower to clinch the series in Melbourne.
If they don't, they will still be better off than four years ago, with one last "shot at forever" - as Paul O'Connell likens the prospect of a series win - heading for the finale in Sydney.

Article text: It was the final major barrier to building an additional 20,000 homes in the city over the next decade.
The Local Development Plan (LDP) sets out where new houses can be built, based on a forecast that the population will grow by a quarter over 20 years.
Cardiff council said the city was in "dire need" of the plan, to help it manage its growth.
A final decision will be made by the local authority in the coming weeks, but it is expected to be rubber stamped by the council.
Under the plan:
The inspector has not given as much protection to the greenbelt on the edge of the city as a number of councillors and residents had campaigned for.
The process has been long and controversial.
Supporters say the expansion is needed to deal with the shortage of housing in the city, while opponents claim the city's infrastructure will not be able to cope.
The plan is based on projections of a growth in the population from the 320,000 to nearly 400,000 over the period between 2006 and 2026.
The last time Cardiff grew at this scale was at the height of the coal industry a century ago.
Cardiff council cabinet member for planning and sustainability Ramesh Patel said the city was "in dire need" of the plan.
"The last plan was approved 19 years ago and has led to insufficient land being made available for urgent housing needs," he said.
"When the new plan is finally adopted at the end of January, we will ensure that developments in the city are managed effectively with new transport infrastructure, schools, health facilities and other community facilities.
"The plan gives us the control to guide development and manage the growth of the city."

After a row over diversity at last year's ceremony, the rest of the best male category comprises artists from BAME backgrounds.
Craig David, Kano, Michael Kiwanuka and Skepta, who beat Bowie at the Mercury Prize, are all up for the title.
Skepta has three nominations in total, with additional nods in the best breakthrough and best album categories.
Girl band Little Mix also have three - including best group and best single, for their song Shout Out To My Ex.
Meanwhile, Beyonce and her younger sister Solange Knowles are both up for best international female, after releasing albums about race and politics last year.
Brit Awards 2017: Nominations in full
There were calls for a boycott of last year's Brits, after BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) artists were absent from all but the international categories.
Organisers later overhauled the voting system, improving the representation of both women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.
Grime star Stormzy, who called the Brits "embarrassing" in his single One Take Freestyle, this year receives a nomination in the best British breakthrough category.
Craig David said he felt grime, urban and R&B artists had excelled themselves in the past year.
"What they're doing for British music is pivotal, and it's moving a whole scene forward," he told BBC News.
"Diversity is the key," added Michael Kiwanuka. "His career has been so epic. He influenced me and so many other artists. There's no competition."
The best female category sees competition between Ellie Goulding, Lianne La Havas, Emeli Sande, NAO and Anohni - who formerly performed under the name Antony and the Johnsons.
In the international categories, there was also recognition for Leonard Cohen, who died late last year.
For the first time, the nominations were revealed in a live programme on ITV1.
The show included performances from best international female nominee Christine & The Queens and Britain's Got Talent contestant Callum Scott, whose cover of Dancing On My Own was a major international hit last year.
Blues singer Rag 'N' Bone Man also performed, after being presented with the Brits Critics' Choice Award, singling him out as one to watch in 2017.
The prize, which has previously gone to the likes of Adele, Sam Smith and Florence + The Machine, is one of only two awards to be announced in advance.
The other - the Brits Icon award - will be given to Robbie Williams. It is the 18th Brit he has won, either as a solo artist or as a member of Take That.
Little Mix, Emeli Sande and The 1975 will all perform at the event, at London's O2 Arena on Wednesday, 22 February, with more acts to be announced soon.
Singer Michael Buble is due to host - but it is unclear whether he will be able to fulfil the role after his son was diagnosed with cancer last year.

Article text: However, when you're at the very top of an organisation and juggling multiple demands it's even tougher.
To drive their organisations to success, chief executives need to be crystal clear about their goals.
They also need to not get distracted when carrying them out.
The key to keeping on top of your workload and not getting overwhelmed includes:
Delegating work, keeping meetings fairly short and working intensely in only short bursts.
You should also remember to stay focussed, and keep a decent work-life balance otherwise you will risk burning out.
Here some of the world's top business leaders share their secrets to not getting bogged down by the details.
"You really have to evolve into a headset where you're only going to hold yourself accountable for the things you can control. They say 'yin yang'. It's a balance. Everything in life is a balance. So you have to balance your life. It'll make you stronger in the things you do, it'll make you better at what you do.
