Article text: The President's press secretary, Jay Carney, has said that he welcomed the Prime Minister's call for Britain to remain in the European Union, adding that the US believed the UK was stronger for being in the EU, and the EU was stronger for having the UK as a member.
In the modern version of the special relationship, what Carney called the essential relationship, Britain is valued as an ally precisely because it is one of the leaders of the biggest economy in the world.
Some in Washington think Mr Cameron's speech threatens that role and introduce more unnecessary uncertainty to an already uncertain world.
Until recently, the promise of a referendum from Mr Cameron was seen in Washington as just another phase in the rocky relationship between the UK and continental Europeans.
But now alarm bells are ringing. He is publicly saying that referendums could turn countries inwards.
"We have a growing relationship with the EU as an institution, which has an increasing voice in the world, and we want to see a strong British voice in that EU. That is in America's interests. We welcome an outward-looking EU with Britain in it," he said.
President Obama repeated this view in a phone call to Mr Cameron.
The Americans are worried for several reasons.
They fear the debate that will rage for the next few years will undermine Britain's voice in the EU and diminish its power.
Indeed, insiders say that has already happened - they find other EU members aren't taking Britain seriously.
While US officials would agree with Mr Cameron's push for a more competitive, less rule-bound Europe, they fear he will now be less able to achieve it.
There is internal politics too. There is an argument inside the administration over whether or not to seek a free-trade agreement with the EU.
Those who want to go ahead may fear their position has been undermined.
They may feel that Mr Cameron has given ammunition to those who argue it is not worth the bother. Some suggest it would be an irony if such a deal was negotiated - and Britain found itself outside the new free-trade area.
Although the prime minister clearly intends to sell a deal that keeps Britain inside the EU there are fears that he will fail.
The Obama administration values the European Union as an ally that largely shares its vision, and acts with it in the Middle East, over Iran and North Africa.
Officials will fret over the next few years that Britain really could leave and that would badly weaken the EU.
At the risk of hurting British egos, they simply don't see Britain - especially with a declining defence budget - as anything more than a medium-sized power in its own right.
As one insider put it to me: "At the moment Britain is a leader in the biggest economy in the world - what's the strategy for being out? Just trail around behind us?"

Article text: The company said staff who walk out in the ongoing dispute over the role of conductors would be paid the money when industrial action came to an end.
The RMT union described it as "another outrageous and bullying attack on staff fighting for public safety".
General secretary Mick Cash said staff were "signing away basic human rights".
Passengers on Southern services have suffered months of delays and disruption caused by the industrial action over the introduction of Driver Only Operated trains.
The next 48-hour walkout takes place next week, with further strikes planned in the run-up to Christmas and over the new year.
Mr Cash said it was "despicable" that Southern "felt it necessary to try and hoodwink staff" into signing an agreement with the "sole purpose to stop lawful industrial action".
In a statement, Southern said: "Passengers have had to endure 17 days of strikes so far with 11 more to come, causing misery and hardship to people's work and family lives.
"We feel we cannot make these payments to conductors who are planning to take industrial action.
"They will be paid once the industrial action is over."

Article text: The controversial memo broke the firm’s code of conduct, Google’s chief executive Sundar Pichai said on Monday in an email to employees.
The memo, shared widely at the weekend, suggested there were fewer women at Google due to biological differences.
Mr Pichai said the text crossed the line due to it "advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace”.
Entitled Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber, the paper argued that "the abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership”.
The author wrote: "We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism."
Google has not confirmed who the employee is, but media reports name him as James Damore.
"[I was fired for] perpetuating gender stereotypes," he told Reuters.
He also claimed to have received "many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude" for speaking out.
In his note to staff sent on Monday afternoon, Mr Pichai spoke at length about protecting free speech in Google’s ranks, and that "much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it”.
But he added: "To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.
"It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects 'each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination’."
The tech firm's new head of diversity, Danielle Brown, had earlier criticised the memo saying it had "advanced incorrect assumptions about gender".

The dispute is linked to the return of national pay bargaining in the sector.
Lecturers at most colleges are angry about a 1% pay offer and are concerned about the differences between pay at different colleges.
They claim there are disparities of up to Â£10,000 a year.
The dispute at colleges in Glasgow is over a distinct issue - the union wants these colleges to join the national pay bargaining set-up.

Article text: Meyiwa, 27, was shot on Sunday, apparently after burglars entered his girlfriend's house near Johannesburg.
A suspect appeared in court on Friday and was charged with the murder of the popular goalkeeper.
Meyiwa's death shocked South Africa and has highlighted the high rates of violent crime in the country.
The funeral took place at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Meyiwa's hometown of Durban.
Many of the mourners were wearing T-shirts with a picture of Meyiwa, who was widely seen as an inspiring figure.
Others wore red or black replica football shirts in the colours of Meyiwa's team, Orlando Pirates.
Meyiwa's coffin was driven into the stadium, followed by Orlando Pirates players and officials.
Mourners cried as videos were played showing Meyiwa training and playing football.
Celebrating Senzo Meyiwa's life was the main theme for the tens of thousands of fans who packed into the stands. The chairman of the country's football association said he hoped that this could be a "turning-point" in the long-running debate over violent crime.
And Senzo Meyiwa's father Sam told me he wanted more random searches, to cut the number of guns in South Africa. "We are no longer safe in our houses," he said.
"The entire nation is crying. We have all lost. Our condolences to Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana," said Durban Mayor James Nxumalo, AFP reported, using a nickname for South Africa's national team.
"Our hearts are bleeding."
President Zuma ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast on Saturday to honour the goalkeeper.
Following Meyiwa's death, South Africa's domestic football league postponed this weekend's scheduled Johannesburg derby between Orlando Pirates and rivals Kaiser Chiefs.
The Durban stadium was also named as the venue for host South Africa's next Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.
The funeral of another South African sporting hero, former 800m world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, also took place on Saturday.
Mulaudzi was killed in a car accident the day before Meyiwa's death.
Police said on Friday that a suspect had been identified in Meyiwa's killing after an identity parade.
The man, named as Zanokuhle Mbatha, 25, faced charges of murder and armed robbery at a court hearing and is due to appear again on 11 November. Police had offered a reward for information on the attack.
"There are still other suspects outstanding and we appeal to the public to continue providing information in support of the investigation," a police statement said.

Article text: The Scottish Chambers of Commerce's (SCC) quarterly business survey found firms were still performing strongly.
But a number cited continued difficulties in the eurozone and world economies as a challenge to growth.
SCC said the "exceptional" performance of the second quarter would be hard to replicate in the final quarter of 2014.
However, it added that stability was "returning to the Scottish economy".
The business survey, carried out in conjunction with the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, drew responses from more than 420 firms across five major sectors - construction, financial and business services, manufacturing, retail and wholesale and tourism.
It found international events such as the Commonwealth Games and the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles boosted tourism performance, with average room rates increasing for the sixth consecutive quarter.
But in the retail and wholesale sector, more firms reported a fall in sales revenue than a rise.
SCC said that trend was expected to remain largely unchanged in the next quarter.
Orders/sales grew in the third quarter for the construction and manufacturing sectors, but at a lower rate than the previous quarter.
Sales revenue growth was broadly unchanged for financial and business services firms.
Recruitment difficulties were still a concern for businesses, particularly in the construction sector, where almost half of firms that recruited said they had experienced difficulties.
SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said: "The construction sector and manufacturing sectors are still performing well but face ongoing challenges as both sectors experienced lower sales growth compared with the previous high performing quarter.
"Businesses have indicated that employment trends remain promising and are expected to grow, as more firms report increased levels of hiring.
"In particular, the retail sector reported its highest increase in employment for 10 years.
"As business looks to hire more people, continued challenges exist, as key sectors are often unable to find the right talent to employ, potentially slowing down the pace of economic growth."

Article text: Organisers campaigning to save Lewisham Hospital say the plans are "crazy and ill thought out".
Under proposals, its A&E will close and the maternity unit be downgraded after neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust ran up debts of Â£150m.
The government said "doing nothing is not an option" and is to make a decision on 1 February.
Campaigners are angry Lewisham Hospital, which is not part of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, is being targeted in a re-organisation of services across the area following the trusts's financial problems.
Under the plans, the trust's Queen Elizabeth Hospital site in Woolwich would come together with Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to create a new organisation.
Lewisham's A&E unit would then be downgraded to an urgent care centre, meaning emergency cases would be seen at nearby hospitals

Article text: The Speaker announced the clerks, who advise him on conduct and constitutional issues, would also no longer wear wing collars and white tie.
Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth said the tradition of wearing wigs went back "several centuries".
But Mr Bercow said there was an even older tradition of not wearing wigs.
He announced the changes on Monday, but added that clerks would keep part of their garb - black gowns, to signify they are experts on procedure and constitutional issues.
Mr Bercow said changes to clothing and headgear represented the "overwhelming view" of clerks themselves.
They would "convey to the public a marginally less stuffy and forbidding image of this chamber at work".
But Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, raised a point of order, telling the Commons: "I was surprised by [the] statement, which had the sort of appearance of an executive order."
He added that traditional clerks' dress was "key to the dignity of the House" and had been so "for several centuries", adding that MPs "should discuss this".
Mr Bercow replied that it was "a matter that can properly be decided by the Speaker", adding that the House of Commons Commission had approved the changes, which clerks themselves had suggested.
He said that, if one went back more than a "couple of hundred years", the situation was different from that presented by Sir Gerald, and that "several centuries ago", clerks "did not wear wigs".
Mr Bercow has refrained from wearing a wig himself in the Commons since becoming Speaker in 2009, as did his predecessors Michael Martin and Betty Boothroyd.
