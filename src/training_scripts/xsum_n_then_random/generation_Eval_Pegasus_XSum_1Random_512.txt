Article text: The foxhound was deliberately run over near Conwy in February after police could not bring it under control.
The review said no action should be taken against the officers involved.
But it also recommended the force should introduce new procedures for dealing with similar incidents in future.
Traffic police drove at the dog at high speed on the dual carriageway between Llanfairfechan roundabout and the Conwy tunnel in the early hours of 22 February.
Firearms officers were sent to the scene, but there was concern they would not be able to get a safe shot.
The dog had gone missing from a hunt and police said the owner supported the force's decision.
The force voluntarily referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because of the level of public concern.
The IPCC determined that North Wales Police should continue with its own investigation and advised on the makeup of the review panel, which included a vet, a representative of the RSPCA and a senior officer from the Metropolitan Police's Dog Support Unit.
The review has also recommended that patrol vehicles should carry slip leads and nets, which may have helped in this case.
Officers should get expert advice from dog handlers and vets if a similar situation happens again, it said.
Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard said: "It is regrettable that the dog died in this way and I fully understand the level of public concern.
"I am grateful to the panel who gave their time and expertise to carefully consider all aspects of the incident and for their diligence in coming to their conclusions and recommendations, which along with the learning points are being put in place by the force."

Article text: Daniel Swift sent explicit pictures to the 14-year-old and arranged for her to travel to Lincoln to meet him for sex.
He was caught when those behind the sting detained him and called police.
Swift, 47, of Princess Street, admitted charges of attempting to sexually communicate with a child and attempting to meet a child following grooming.
He was ordered to be detained in a secure psychiatric unit after Lincoln Crown Court heard he had been treated for over 25 years for mental health problems and had been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.
Richard Thatcher, prosecuting, told the court: "This case arises through the defendant's contact through social media with, as he believed her to be, a 14-year-old girl called Emma.
"She was actually an adult woman who had set up that alter ego on social media," he said.
The court heard he first made contact with 'Emma' in April when she told him her age.
"He began by asking if she wanted a daddy to look after her," Mr Thatcher told the court.
"There was a conversation as to whether this involved him becoming involved with her mother

Article text: The decision comes as some clinicians warned it could put patients at risk.
The unit would carry out complex vascular surgery for potentially life-threatening conditions like abdominal aortic aneurysms.
However, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said this only represented about 20% of its vascular treatments.
The health board insisted the majority of its vascular services would still be carried out at the other hospital sites across north Wales, including Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor and Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
"Currently, around 300 complex vascular surgery operations are carried out each year in North Wales - representing about 20% of our vascular activity - and we are committed to continuing the majority of our work at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd and Wrexham Maelor Hospital," said Dr Evan Moore, the board's executive medical director.
"Units such as these - which provide a hub for major vascular arterial operations - are being created across the UK, and there is strong evidence that such sites improve clinical outcomes and patient safety, whilst attracting the best staff and help to develop the best infrastructure."
Vascular medicine covers a wide range of medical procedures and interventions, from screening for risks of aneurysms - where weakened walls of major blood vessels could burst - to treating varicose veins, stroke prevention and helping ensure dialysis patients can continue their treatment.
But speaking ahead of the announcement, one consultant physician at Ysbyty Gwynedd raised concerns.
"This is an integrated service, and other aspects of what we do here would be threatened - radiology, urology and gastroenterology to name just a few," Dr Mahdi Jibani told BBC Wales.
Ken Jones of the North Wales Kidney Association added: "If this service goes, it will cost lives, there's no two ways about it."
Arfon assembly member Sian Gwenllian said it represented "yet another example of services creeping eastwards".
But Dr Moore argued that far from hitting services at other hospitals in the region, vascular services would benefit from a specialised hub.
"Hubs such as the one we have planned, built on the considerable knowledge, skills and practices already here, would protect connected services at these locations.
"These include outpatient consultations, investigations, diagnostic procedures, varicose vein and day case surgeries

Article text: "His condition is considered stable" and "it is too early to make any predictions about his future health," Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva wrote on her Instagram account.
Ms Karimova-Tillyaeva pleaded for people to "refrain from speculations".
Mr Karimov, 78, has been leader of the former Soviet republic since before independence in 1991.
In an unusual move on Sunday, the Uzbek government admitted he was receiving treatment but did not give details.
The BBC's Abdujalil Abdurasulov says that the announcement caught many by surprise in authoritarian Uzbekistan, a country where any information about the president's health is treated like a state secret.
President Karimov is known to have had health issues, but the government has never previously issued a statement about his health.
It has become a tradition in Uzbekistan for the president to dance during major holiday festivities.
By doing so Mr Karimov sends a message to the nation that he is fit and healthy.
Everyone was expecting the president to attend Independence Day celebrations - perhaps the government's confirmation that he is in hospital was a necessary move to prepare the public for his non-appearance.
Tashkent-based human rights campaigner Surat Ikramov says that most people are too afraid to talk openly about Mr Karimov's hospitalisation in one of the most repressive countries in the world.
"Any vocalisation that Mr Karimov's power is not absolute is seen as a threat to the entire system," says Human Rights Watch spokesman Steve Swerdlow.
"Even if he survives this illness or whatever it is, this is an acknowledgement of [Mr] Karimov's mortality, and of the fact that the system is about to change."

Article text: Geoffrey Sutcliffe admitted causing the death of Lucille Abraham, 92.
When applying to renew his driving licence, a court heard, Sutcliffe said he met the "required eyesight standard" and did not need glasses to drive.
He was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years.
Sutcliffe hit Ms Abraham, from Baildon, at the junction of Godwin Street and Kirkgate, in Bradford, last October.
During an eye test the previous month, Prosecutor Michael Smith said, Sutcliffe told the optometrist he was not a driver.
Had he done so, Mr Smith said, she would have said that his eyesight had failed the visual acuity test.
"The defendant suffers from cataracts in both eyes and it seems that the medical opinion here is that he should not undergo an operation on his right eye because effectively that's the only eye that can see," said Mr Smith.
Barrister Ken Green, for Sutcliffe, said he had been driving for over 60 years without any previous offending and his client intended never to drive again and had surrendered his licence.
"He will never forget that day and I am sure he will never forgive himself for that error that he made," said Mr Green.
Passing sentence, Judge Colin Burn said "It is obvious that you should not, with the benefit of hindsight, have been driving at all on that day.
"Your eyesight wasn't up to it as a matter of objective fact."
He added: "The misrepresentation you made about your eyesight was a contributory cause of this collision because you shouldn't have been driving at all."

Article text: The Cumbrians have gone 11 League Two games without defeat since the start of the campaign - a club record - and are up to third in the table.
Carlisle's early pressure failed to yield too many clear-cut chances although Michael Raynes was inches off sliding home a Jason Kennedy flick-on after Danny Grainger swung over a corner from the right.
The home side were second best for periods before half-time, but improved after the break and Raynes forced Sam Walker to tip his close-range header on to the crossbar.
Raynes was involved again when Kennedy gave Carlisle the lead in the 50th minute, the defender heading Nicky Adams' corner back across the face of goal for Kennedy to force home.
Colchester missed a great chance to level the scores in the 66th minute when Sammie Szmodics found himself one-on-one with Gillespie but lifted the ball over the goalkeeper and over the bar from eight yards.
Szmodics then had a diving header cleared off the line, but substitute Ibehre relieved the tension in the 79th minute when his header from Grainger's corner on the left slipped through Walker's hands and into the net.

Article text: Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said forces had mainly "done well" with 20% cuts in four years and more savings were likely.
Sir Thomas said a "smaller service" would have to "work smarter".
In December, the chief of the Met Police warned public safety would be at risk unless radical measures were taken to deal with funding cuts.
But speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, newly knighted Sir Thomas said: "Austerity is here to stay.
"The police have already made, and done it well in the main, cuts of 20% in the last four years and they are facing cuts of a further 5% next year.
"There will inevitably be a time where they can't take any more but let us remember that measured crime has fallen dramatically - but so have the demands made on the police."
Asked if there was room for further cuts, Sir Thomas said: "In some respects there are further efficiencies to be obtained, that is undoubtedly the case.
"They [police forces] need to work smarter because they will be working smaller."
Sir Thomas said forces had not done enough work to analyse new demands being made on them, particularly with regards to cyber crime.
He also said that while any crime reported to the police had to be taken seriously, there were some crimes that were "more serious than others".
"Nobody would argue that shoplifting is as serious as a violent assault and therefore the police need to look for the crimes that matter most to people, that do greatest harms to communities - serious and organised crime, drugs, violent offences, the grooming and sexual exploitation of children," he said.
Last month, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that unless police "act fast" and with "courage" to implement far-reaching reforms, the cuts would endanger public safety.
He suggested police forces in England and Wales should merge and share resources with other emergency services.
Sir Hugh Orde, the Association of Chief Police Officers' president, has also recently warned that police forces were struggling to deal with reductions in funding.

Gloria Allred, the lawyer representing Ramos, says the case has now been resolved a week before the trial was due to start.
She has released a photo of the pair shaking hands and smiling.
The lawsuit said that West attacked Ramos in 2013 after the paparazzo asked the rapper why he wouldn't talk to photographers.
"Celebrities are not above the law, and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question," Allred wrote in a statement.
Shawn Holley, West's lawyer, has not made a comment about the settlement.

Murray had hoped to claim a first men's doubles Slam title having won the mixed doubles with Jelena Jankovic in 2007.
The 29-year-old was watched by younger brother Andy on Centre Court, 24 hours after his singles semi-final defeat.
"I didn't know he was coming till I heard him shouting," said Jamie Murray.
"He was shouting all the time, encouragement. "It's a big tie for us. There's going to be a lot of people coming out to support. Motivation is high for the match."
Murray and Peers had three chances to break serve in the first five games of the doubles final but could not convert, and Rojer and Tecau took advantage.
Rojer hammered away a smash to convert their third set point in the tie-break, and when Peers netted a volley to drop serve early in the second, the lead was convincing.
A Peers double fault invited huge pressure at 4-4 in the third and Rojer proved more solid than Murray at the net to earn the decisive break.
The fourth seeds served out the match to love and fell to their knees in celebration, with Tecau finally getting his hands on the trophy after three times finishing runner-up.
"It was a good tournament for us," added Murray, who had never previously been past the quarter-finals of the men's doubles in a Slam.
"We got to the final of Wimbledon, which is not so easy to do.  I mean, my best result in a Grand Slam by quite some distance, I guess.
"It's sad to lose but I guess overall it was a positive tournament."

Article text: The broadcaster's media service was one of the most prominent online platforms to use Flash.
Adobe's plug-in has been criticised by some security experts, who said it was a weak point of many sites.
Flash use has been decreasing and the move will provide a further blow, but it will not kill off Adobe's product, said one security expert.
The BBC announced the decision to move towards HTML5 on Tuesday. In a blogpost, it said it was "now confident [it could] achieve the playback quality you'd expect from the BBC without using a third-party plug-in" such as Flash player.
Users have been invited to visit a BBC site where they can set a cookie in their browsers that will allow them to access the HTML5 player when they visit iPlayer in future. However, the Flash version will remain available.
The BBC said it was testing the new player on a range of browsers, including Google Chrome on all platforms, Firefox 41 and Safari on iOS 5 and above.
Others chosen for the test are Opera 32, Internet Explorer 11 and Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and Blackberry OS 10.3.1.
The BBC added that it was also going  to "move away from the BBC Media Player app on Android devices" with users invited to join a limited beta test in the blogpost.
"We've been working for the last few months to upgrade our existing HTML5 player to make it usable on the desktop as well as mobile and tablet," wrote James East, the BBC's product manager for media playout.
"We'll be working over the coming months to improve the HTML5 player to match the abilities of our Flash player and to refine the functionality and design based on your feedback."
He said that most video programmes would be available on HTML5 on iPlayer immediately but, for those that took longer to become playable, users would be able to use the old player.
Adobe's Flash is one of many plug-ins used to display multimedia content on websites. HTML5, the latest version of the dictionary used by the majority of the worldwide web, incorporates video hosting, where its predecessors did not.
The BBC has joined Netflix and other major firms in adopting HTML5 and information from analytics website Built With shows a downward trend in the number using Flash over the last 12 months.
The iPlayer, which the BBC said received 250 million TV and radio requests in July this year, was one of the most prominent.
However, many of the internet's largest sites still do use Flash, including Amazon, IMDB and the US video site Hulu.
The plug-in has been repeatedly criticised over its security record and, in June this year, Adobe had to release an emergency software patch after a serious vulnerability was found.
But the security expert Chris Green said Flash still had an important role to play and was sometimes unfairly maligned.
"The industry has moved on from trying to shoehorn one thing in, whether that is Flash or Microsoft's Silverlight. It continues to be very effective in delivering rich content into web pages."
He added that media outlets tended to focus on Flash's weaknesses because it was so widely used.

Article text: Mrs Foster said:  "We would like to see the petition of concern got rid of".
Any vote in the assembly can be made dependent on a petition of concern if it is supported by 30 MLAS - meaning the motion will only pass if it has cross-community support.
The purpose is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another.
Mrs Foster added: "I think we need to talk about, maybe after the election, getting rid of the petition of concern altogether."
If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support.
In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting.
Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions.
A valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs.
Introduced as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the procedure was originally designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in the assembly.
However, its use has become controversial, and the DUP have been criticised for using the mechanism to stop votes on same-sex marriage being passed, and for preventing motions of no confidence going through.
According to figures compiled by an investigative website, The Detail, over a five-year period from 2011 to 2016  the petition of concern procedure was used 115 times.
The DUP was the only party with more than 30 MLAS so it presented petitions without other party support.
Over the five years, they signed 86 petitions, while the SDLP and Sinn FÃ©in signed 29.
The Green Party endorsed four, Alliance three, and the Ulster Unionists two.
Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster made it clear that she wanted to see change
"We talk a lot about the petition of concern and our opponents talk a lot about the petition of concern," she said.
"We would actually like to see the petition of concern got rid of for everything, but I think our opponents would like to keep it for the things they want to to use the petition of concern for and not allow us to use it."
Alliance Party leader Naomi Long has called for reform of the petition of concern.
She said the veto was the main reason developments such as same-sex marriage had not yet been introduced in Northern Ireland.
"We need to get it back to its original intent and away from what it has become, which is used and abused to protect parties' selfish interests," Mrs Long said.

Article text: Richard Ratcliffe's wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, was arrested in April while visiting family with their two-year-old daughter and is accused of seeking to "overthrow the regime".
Mr Ratcliffe has asked David Cameron to help, and says the Foreign Office is doing more "as this gets more serious".
His daughter is with family in Iran.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 37, of north London, works for the London-based Thomson Reuters Foundation charity.
She travelled to Iran on an Iranian passport with daughter Gabriella and was arrested at Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport on 3 April and taken to Kerman in the south-east of the country.
Her family had expected her to be released last week, but a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps now claims she heads a "foreign-linked hostile network".
Mr Ratcliffe, who has been trying to get a visa to visit his wife, told BBC Radio 4 she had spent 45 days in solitary confinement and this had made her "very weak".
"When she came out she wasn't able to walk without blackouts and she had a problem with her hair falling out and she'd lost quite a lot of weight," he said.
Her condition improved during a spell living alongside other inmates and she was then told she would be released, Mr Ratcliffe said.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe left Kerman prison on 5 June but, instead of being released, her parents were told she was being moved to a different prison.
Mr Ratcliffe said the family then heard "nothing from her for a number of days", adding: "Last week we celebrated Gabriella's birthday and we had no idea where she was."
On Monday Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe called her parents to say she was in a prison in Tehran - and Mr Ratcliffe believes that may help her.
"Now she's in Tehran then, if nothing else, the Iranian authorities can look more seriously at what's going on and look at these crazy theories coming out from the provincial office," he said.
He said the reasons for the accusations against his wife were "not at all clear", but he believed they came from the Kerman branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard - and in part they might be "justifying that they've held her for 70 days".
He said the accusations were not detailed but they suggested his wife was "in charge of this great network of media organisations and espionage agencies and that she and Gabriella are there running the whole thing".
He added: "It feels this is wrapped up in Iranian politics and different factions fighting and holding her as some sort of bargaining chip."
The Foreign Office said it was urgently seeking information on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's situation.

Article text: The trial of Edwin McLaren began in September 2015 with the 15 jurors needed for a Scottish criminal trial and ended more than a year and a half later with just 12.
There were concerns that if they had lost another juror the case would have collapsed.
That is what happened with another mammoth fraud case at the Old Bailey in London in 2005.
The London Underground Jubilee Line case heard evidence for about 140 days over a 21-month period before one juror "went on strike".
The court had already lost two jurors when one became pregnant and another was arrested for benefit fraud.
After missing work for almost two years one juror became aware that he owed thousands in pension contributions, which his employer had not been liable for while he was on the jury.
He refused to take part in the jury until his financial situation was sorted out, claiming loss of earnings threatened his ability to pay Oxford university fees for a course he was due to start.
The Attorney General in England at the time, Lord Goldsmith, brought forward legislation to allow complex fraud trials to be held without juries.
It was defeated in the Lords two years later with peers arguing that trial by jury was a bedrock of the criminal justice system.
The UK government had said major trials put too much pressure on jurors.
"The use of a jury is a bulwark of not just Scottish justice but British justice and I would say there should be a presumption that the jury system continues," Douglas Mill, former chief executive of the Law Society of Scotland, told the BBC.
But Mr Mill added that fraud was now so "specialised" that the police, the Crown office prosecutors and defence lawyers all had experts who dealt only with such cases.
He said the only people who were not specialists were the jury.
"It is left to 15 very lay people who are being asked to assimilate vast numbers of documents over an endless number of days," he said.
"Is that in the interests of justice? Big question."
Law lecturer Andrew Tickell also said fraud cases were complex and difficult to follow.
In the case of Edwin McLaren, the indictment carried 29 separate charges and it was the Crown's job to prove every one.
This required a large number of witnesses and mountains of documents.
The Glasgow Caledonian University law lecturer said: "If the Crown is going to bring forward a mega case then it really has to bring forward quite substantial evidence to buttress that claim.
"Juries have to decide on the guilt in the cases and so have to sit through many months of evidence

Article text: The Basque side are marooned near the bottom of La Liga - they are above the relegation zone on goal difference - and a limp performance in Friday's 2-0 defeat against lowly Las Palmas was the final straw.
This is how his 364 days in charge went.
After three days of speculation, the news was finally confirmed with a brief statement from the Basque club on Monday afternoon.
"Real Sociedad would like to thank David Moyes and [his assistant, also departing] Billy McKinlay for the professional conduct, commitment and dedication which they showed during their roles in the running of the first team," the club said.
"At the same time, we would like to wish them all the best in their future ventures, both professional and personal."
The Scot leaves behind a team marooned near the foot of La Liga, and a limp performance in Friday night's 2-0 defeat against lowly Las Palmas was the final straw.
The dismal display, as much as the result, forced club president Jokin Aperribay into holding crisis talks over the weekend.
Aperribay did not want to rush into a hasty decision on the back of one bad game, but even after the dust had settled a couple of days later he still felt that a change was necessary.
The official announcement was supposed to have been made on Sunday evening, but it was delayed for a few hours because Moyes's flight back to Bilbao from Manchester was cancelled.
But once he returned to Spain on Monday and met personally with Aperribay, there was no need to delay the inevitable any longer and the former Everton and Manchester United coach's spell in La Liga was brought to a swift end.
After La Real's recent struggles, the trip to Las Palmas was always billed as a significant encounter for Moyes's regime, but the general feeling was that his job was safe unless his team delivered a disastrous display.
Unfortunately for the former Everton and Manchester United boss, 'disastrous' is pretty much the right word to describe the way his team performed - or didn't - against a Las Palmas outfit which had previously only won one game all season.
The hosts were clearly superior, deserved their goals from Jonathan Viera and Sergio Araujo, and were rarely seriously threatened by Moyes's team

Charlie Hunnam, who plays Arthur, said: "One of my favourite places in the UK is the Highlands of Scotland."
"When I found out that we were shooting there I was very, very excited."
The star of Pacific Rim and former TV series Sons of Anarchy and Byker Grove, added: "The Highlands of Scotland are absolutely sensational."
Hunnam made the comments in a video for VisitBritain, which has created a tourism campaign around the film.
The actor's experience of filming in the Scottish Highlands was starkly different from those of other film stars to have shot scenes there.
Scarlett Johansson described shooting scenes in Glen Coe in November 2011 for sci-fi Under the Skin as "brutal, cold and wet".
At the movie's world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, she told a news conference: "It was as if you had just picked us up and dropped us into the middle of absolutely nowhere.
"It was harsh and it was brutal and it was cold, it was wet and it was terrifying but we pulled through."
Michael Fassbender and Paddy Considine told of battling the elements on Skye while shooting 2015's Macbeth.
Fassbender, who starred in the lead role, described the island as "cold, wet and beautiful".
Considine said some of the other members of the cast succumbed to hypothermia during the filming.
He told the BBC at the film's Edinburgh premiere: "It got pretty bad there."
"A few people got hypothermia
