Jason Chaffetz, is issuing subpoenas to two Secret Service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the White House, interrupting a bomb investigation . Chaffetz had asked Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the March 4 incident. Clancy declined the request and instead testified as the sole witness. Clancy is pictured here at the hearing . The committee is trying to get to the bottom of allegations that two senior agents had been drinking when they drove into the area and nudged a construction barrier with their vehicle as they intruded on the investigation of a suspicious item. Chaffetz said the committee's top priority in its review of the incident is to ensure that the Secret Service keeps the president and his family safe. But he also wants the agency to be transparent. The Republican lawmaker said Department of Homeland Security, the parent organization of the Secret Service, 'requested that information remain secret and be kept from Congress and the American people.' 'Those restrictions are unacceptable. Under such restrictions, the Committee cannot perform its essential duties to evaluate and propose much-needed legislative reforms for this troubled agency,' Chaffetz said. Clancy has been criticized for the agency's handling of the incident and has complained that he was not told about it for five days, which he called unacceptable. He said he only learned about the misbehavior from discussions about an anonymous email that was circulating within the agency. The email described the off-duty agents as 'both extremely intoxicated' and confused about the investigation activity. It said uniformed Secret Service officers at the scene 'were going to arrest both of them, but the UD (Uniform Division) watch commander said not to.' Because Clancy was not made aware of the incident for several days, he was unable to keep surveillance footage that could have shed further light on the matter from being destroyed. It is Secret Service policy to toss out tapes after 72 hours. The only videos that remain from the night in question are those taken of the investigation into the suspected bomb and they do not give a complete picture of what happened after the agents bumped into the barrier. The Homeland Security Department's inspector general is investigating allegations against the agents. The Secret Service had no comment on the subpoenas Tuesday evening. The only videos that remain from the night in question are those taken of the investigation into the suspected bomb and they do not give a complete picture of what happened after the agents bumped into the barrier . Police surveillance video shown publicly for the first time last week shows Secret Service agents in their government vehicle driving through the secured area and nudging a temporary barrier at low speed as it drove toward a checkpoint . But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson took issue with Chaffetz' complaints about the cooperation given his committee. 'I regret that Chairman Chaffetz and his staff have taken the unprecedented and unnecessary step of subpoenaing two members of the U.S. Secret Service with the responsibility for the protection of the president, his family and the White House complex,' Johnson said in a statement released Tuesday night. 'Chairman Chaffetz's assertion that this department has been "uncooperative" is simply wrong.' Johnson said his department offered to let 'a number of Secret Service personnel, including the two that have been subpoenaed' to participate in 'transcribed interviews with committee staff,' but Chaffetz and his team rejected that offer. The DHS head asserted that it is his job, as it is Clancy's, to protect Secret Service agents from the 'visibility, public glare, and inevitable second-guessing, of a congressional hearing' and the agency as a whole from having its work compromised. Johnson said that he also wants to know 'what happened on the night of March 4.' 'This is why the Department's inspector general is conducting a thorough investigation into the matter,' the Homeland Security chief said. In announcing the subpoenas Chaffetz said the Oversight Committee 'understands the sensitive nature of the Secret Service’s work and has made every attempt to perform its oversight duties in light of those concerns.' 'It is disappointing the Department has declined to cooperate. We therefore must take the regrettable step of compelling the agents for interviews before the Committee.'

South Lyon Mayor Tedd Wallace was pulled under the water while body-boarding in St Croix last Sunday. Rushing to his rescue was 70-year-old Gvind Matson, a Danish man on holiday with his wife to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first kiss. Mr Wallace, 63, said Mr Matson also got caught in the choppy waters and as they both tried to cling to the board, he lost grip and never resurfaced. Rescue:  Mayor Tedd Wallace (right) was caught up in waves when a Danish man (not pictured) called Gvind Matson rushed to save him. He too got caught and never resurfaced. Bale Shbaka Kaza (left) came to his aid . Tribute: Mr Wallace posted this tribute to Mr Matson on Sunday afternoon after speaking to his widow . 'He didn't hesitate and took off after me,' Mr Wallace told The Detroit News. 'When he got to me we were both hanging on to the board and trying to paddle towards shore. I don't think we even said anything to each other. Suddenly he let go and went under. I think he had a heart attack right then.' He added: 'I feel so sorry for that man. 'Someone who gave their life for me ... I've been doing a lot of crying this week.' Another man, Bale Shbaka Kaza, eventually spotted Mr Wallace and rescued him from the rocky-based ocean with bare feet. Mr Matson's widow, Annette, said he likely had an epileptic seizure. On holiday: Wallace says he cried a lot during the trip with his wife (left) after the tragic incident . Day job: Wallace, a 63-year-old retired teacher, is the mayor for east Michigan's South Lyons . Mr Wallace said the waves were so powerful they pulled off his wedding ring off his finger. Bale Shbaka Kaza, a local businessman from one of the island's larger cities, was able to pull Wallace to safety. Writing on Facebook, Mr Wallace, a retired teacher, said: 'I want to say thankyou to so many unbelievable good wishes sent me and for prayers offered to Danish man Gvind Matson and family in his valiant effort to rescue me from the rip tide. 'I am so sad. 'His widow Annette sent me a kind email and said he may have had epilepsy seizure at the moment he arrived to me explaining his sudden plunge below surface. 'Bale Shakabaka was my other hero who for reasons he can't figure why had climbed up on rocks and spotted the trouble and scaled 200 feet of sharp rocks in bare feet to reach out and save me. 'Thankyou (sic) for all concerned friends and strangers a like.'

Article text: (CNN)After a handful events in two months, Hillary Clinton has filled her March with a mix of women's events, nonprofit speeches and at least one paid appearance. In January and February, Clinton headlined three events -- only one of which was in the United States. But as Clinton moves closer to her expected 2016 presidential campaign announcement, the former secretary or state has at least seven events scheduled for the month of March. Most of Clinton's events are focused on one thing: women. Clinton starts her month by headlining the 30th anniversary gala for Emily's List -- a pro-Clinton organization that focused on helping Democratic women win elected office. At the D.C. speech on March 3, Clinton is expected to give a nod to the group's importance to Democrats and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics. Emily's List has been energized by Clinton's campaign and has pledged to raise and spend more money than any other election cycle because of the prospect of a Clinton White House. The following week, Clinton will headline two New York events tied to her 1995 speech to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- a speech Clinton regularly references in pitches to women. In that speech Clinton said, "If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all." On March 9, Clinton teams up with Chelsea, her daughter, and Melinda Gates to release a report through the Clinton Foundation that looks at "the gaps that still remain" in women's participation in the economy and politics. The following day -- on March 10 -- Clinton will headline the United Nation's Women Empowerment Principles annual gathering in New York. Clinton will use the speech to outline the findings in the Clinton Foundation report and "reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in Beijing two decades ago," the organizers said in a release about the event. On March 16, Clinton will be inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame at an event in New York. Clinton is not Irish -- her family is of English, Scottish, French, and Welsh descent -- but she is being honored because of "her dedicated work on Irish Peace Process." "Hillary Rodham Clinton is one of the unsung heroes of the success of the Irish peace process," said Irish America co-founder Niall O'Dowd. In 1998, Clinton put together the Vital Voices Conference of women in Belfast, a body that pressed for a piece agreement. The former secretary of state cited her experiences in Ireland during a number of speeches in 2014. O'Dowd is a longtime Clinton supporter, though,and was a member of her 2008 campaign finance team. Some Republicans have questioned how active Clinton was in the Northern Ireland peace process. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote in 2008 that Clinton "seems to be overstating her significance as a catalyst in the Northern Ireland peace process, which was more symbolic than substantive," but that she did play "a helpful role at the margins." On March 19, Clinton will headline her only confirmed paid speech of the month when she heads to Atlantic City for the American Camp Association, NY & NJ Conference. Susie Lupert, the group's executive director, tells CNN, "Yes, just like most nonprofits and conferences, she is being paid for her appearance." But she would not confirm how much she is being paid. On average, Clinton makes between $200,000 and $300,000 per speech. Near the end of the month, on March 23 in Washington, D.C., Clinton will be the keynote speaker at the award celebration for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting from Syracuse University. Robin Toner, who graduated from Syracuse, was the first woman national political correspondent for the New York Times. Syracuse Dean Lorraine Branham said Clinton is a "vivid example — like Robin — of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession." Clinton headlining an event honoring political journalists is somewhat unique because for decades she has held a dim view of the profession. In a 1996, according to the diary of the late Clinton confidant Diane Blair, Clinton said the media are "complete hypocrites." At an event in 2014, Clinton said "journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism." "A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual," she said. "People book onto the shows, political figures, commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it's a good show. You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that's just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken." Clinton's presidential campaign has become a forgone conclusion and Democrats close to Clinton expect she will announce some official move towards the presidency in April.

This comes after Clinton gave only three speeches in January and February .

Article text: Radical new proposals including law changes and possible punishments for team doctors are being drawn up in a bid to halt a shocking 900 per cent increase in reported concussions ahead of this year’s World Cup. High-profile incidents suffered by players during the current Six Nations — including Wales wing George North, England full-back Mike Brown and Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien — have reignited concerns over the extent of concussion in professional rugby and how the potentially fatal injury is handled. A recent RFU audit revealed reported rates of concussion were 59 per cent higher during the 2013-14 Aviva Premiership season than the previous year, with 10.5 concussions occurring every 1,000 player hours. Full-back Mike Brown suffered a heavy blow to the head in England's victory over Italy . But figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show the rate of reported concussions for the current Six Nations stand at 25 per 1,000 player hours after three rounds — more than double the RFU’s figure and almost 10 times the number reported a decade ago. ‘It’s a massively high number and it’s causing significant concern across the sport,’ said one insider at the governing body, World Rugby. ‘Something needs to be done because the World Cup is coming up and the eyes of the world will be on rugby. Concussion is unquestionably the biggest issue facing the sport.’ Significant strides have been made by the sport’s governing bodies in recent times, with a compulsory education programme introduced in the Aviva Premiership at the start of this season and a gradual introduction of pitch-side video technology for medics to access. Brown was ruled out of Ireland game after failing stage three of the return to play concussion protocol – a process all players must undergo after suffering head injuries . World Rugby bosses, aware of potentially damaging long-term effects of multiple concussions to players and desperate to avoid potentially crippling legal action seen in the NFL, have also instituted an extensive education programme. And they are in the processes of drawing up a legally binding document to ensure strict player welfare guidelines are adhered to at the World Cup. But there are fears the current measures do not go far enough and The Mail on Sunday understands World Rugby chiefs have agreed the introduction of further medical protocols ahead of the World Cup which include: . Wales admitted George North should have been removed from play after being knocked unconscious . Rugby union has been on high alert since the NFL agreed to pay out close to a billion dollars to more than 4,000 former gridiron stars with neurodegenerative conditions linked to multiple concussions and the latest figures will do little to ease concern. This week, World Rugby’s head of medicine Dr Martin Raftery presented to the world governing body’s executive committee when the proposal to draw up a worldwide group of players, coaches, referees, doctors and medics with a remit to look at law changes to reduce concussion rates was ratified. ‘We are now starting to understand the magnitude of the problem,’ said Dr Raftery. ‘If we had started the prevention programmes five years ago, we would have been saying, “We need to get it down from five [concussions per 1,000 hours]. Now we know it’s going to be at least 10.5 if not more and I think we’ll see another increase. We are getting far better compliance around concussion but we don’t believe we have finished this process. We’ve reached a baseline but we are not going to allow people to drop the ball in this area. If there’s an issue it will be referred to a disciplinary tribunal and we’ll investigate it.’ There was widespread criticism of the Wales medical team for failing to spot two incidents in which North appeared to be knocked unconscious but was allowed to play on. A World Rugby concussion panel — comprising Dr Raftery and some of the world’s leading brain injury experts — accepted the Welsh medical team’s explanation that they were unsighted for both incidents, although questions remain as to why no one among the team’s backroom staff, some with access to BBC broadcast footage, alerted the medics. ‘The Welsh didn’t have to co-operate but they were extremely co-operative,’ said Raftery. ‘They were also extremely embarrassed about what happened.’ Concerns also persist that so-called ‘independent’ match-day doctors in the Six Nations are often employees of the home union and therefore highly unlikely to challenge or even over-rule a team doctor if they believe a serious breach in protocol has occurred. ‘They will have to be fully independent match-day doctors at the World Cup,’ said Raftery. ‘Every other match day appointment is independent so why not doctors? Imagine if England were playing Australia and the match-day doctor was English and decided that Israel Folau should come off with 20 minutes left even if the Wallaby team doctors said he was fine. There would be absolute outcry. We have to avoid that scenario. ‘The match day doctor has the ability to over-rule team doctors but I’d hope they would look to work together.’ Exeter Chiefs have announced a new research programme to investigate effects of concussion on their players, while Saracens are also trialling micro-chip technology to assess the extent of forces their players are being exposed to.

Article text: It was hugs all round and a few curtsies too when the Netherlands' King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima arrived in Denmark this morning. Waiting at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport was the Scandinavian country's 74-year-old monarch, Queen Margrethe, her husband Prince Henrik, 80 and their son Crown Prince Frederik, 46. But Maxima, glamorous in a grey coat by Dutch designer Claes Iversen, had serious competition in the style stakes from Australian-born Crown Princess Mary, 43, who was elegant in a nude coat and purple pillbox hat. Scroll down for video . Sweeping a curtsey: Crown Princess Mary of Denmark curtsies to Queen Maxima at Kastrup Airport . Royal welcome: A beaming King Willem-Alexander steps off the plane to be greeted by Queen Margrethe . Like the 43-year-old Dutch Queen, mother-of-four Mary chose Louboutins for the occasion and even managed to sweep a low curtsey, despite the teetering height of the heels. Also on hand to welcome the Dutch royals at Kastrup Airport's private royal terminal were other members of the Danish Royal Family, among them Frederik's younger brother Joachim. 45-year-old Joachim's French wife Princess Marie was also there and wore an ensemble that echoed her sister-in-law's. Queen Margrethe, who along with Queen Elizabeth II, is one of the world's only Queens Regnant, then led the way out of the airport, escorted by King Willem-Alexander. The Dutch royals are at the start of a three-day state visit to Denmark, aimed at strengthening links between the two countries. Unsurprisingly, the programme is a busy one, with Maxima and Willem-Alexander set to criss-cross the country over the next couple of days. Hand-in-hand: Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary were at Kastrup to greet the Dutch royals . Poised: The Crown Prince couple appeared ready for action as the Dutch plane touched down . Welcome: The Danish royals gather on the red carpet to welcome their Dutch counterparts . Red carpet treatment: Mary curtsies to King Willem-Alexander while Prince Joachim (right) waits in line . Today includes a lunch with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a glamorous blonde who is married to Stephen Kinnock, son of British politician Neil. Afterwards, the royal couple will travel north to Aalborg in North Jutland where they will attend a conference at the city's university before flying back to Copenhagen for a reception at the Christiansborg Palace. Tomorrow will see them visit the carbon-neutral Samsø island, accompanied by Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Mary, to visit a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole. Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the state boarding schools, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music. The efterskole on Samsø focuses on aquatic sports, diving, aviation and golf, with pupils due to give the royal party, among them sport-mad Frederik, a tour of the school. Warm embrace: Mary shares a hug with the Netherlands' popular Queen Maxima . State visit: Maxima and Willem-Alexander are at the start of the three-day state visit to Denmark . On their way: Queen Margrethe prepares to show King Willem-Alexander his Danish honour guard . Inspecting the troops: The Dutch royals inspected their Danish honour guard before leaving the airport . Frederik and Mary have suffered a bumpy few months, thanks to a film about the Crown Prince's playboy past that is set to be screened later this year. A second programme, this time being made for Australia's Channel Ten, could also cause some discomfort, thanks to claims that Mary had had second thoughts in the run-up to her 2004 wedding. By contrast, Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander have enjoyed a smooth ride of late, with Maxima in particular becoming increasingly popular. One of the most glamorous royals in Europe, the Argentina-born mother-of-three has proved a hit with her Dutch subjects, thanks in no small part to her charity work. She will have plenty of opportunity to do more of that during this week's state visit, with a trip to Bispebjerg Hospital also on their itinerary. Arrival: The Dutch royal couple were whisked off to Fredensborg Palace for a private meeting . All smiles: 43-year-old Queen Maxima appeared to be on cheerful form as the visit began . Joking around: King Willem-Alexander traded quips with the Danish royals on the steps of Fredensborg . Official visit: The Dutch and Danish royal couples pose for an official photo .

Article text: Failure has become a formality for London Welsh and relegation became a reality after they suffered their 18th consecutive Aviva Premiership defeat in a dire meeting with Bath. This was more ‘Sloppy Sunday’ than ‘Super Saturday’ as torrential weather conditions dictated an arm wrestle that confirmed the end of the Exiles’ short-lived spell back in the top flight. For Welsh coach Rowland Phillips, on his first game in charge since taking over from Justin Burnell, it spelt the beginning of a long and painful rebuilding process to get the Oxford-based franchise back to where they want to be. ‘We have to learn our lessons,’ said Phillips. ‘There is honest ambition throughout the club and the mindset has to be about improving. We will have one eye on next season. London Welsh's relegation from the Aviva Premiership was confirmed following their defeat by Bath . Opeti Fonua (centre) scores a try for London Welsh during his side's 29-14 loss against Bath . Alan Awcock  tackles Semesa Rokoduguni  during the Aviva Premiership match at Kassam Stadium . ‘People could say “that’s it” and wind down for the rest of the season but we’re too proud to switch off and wait for the summer holidays.’ The Exiles have a 653-point deficit going into the final four games of the season but this was one of their narrower defeats against a Bath side that will need to improve exponentially if they are going to challenge Leinster in this Saturday’s Champions Cup quarter-final. ‘The conditions were terrible,’ said Bath director of rugby Mike Ford. ‘We’ll put that game in the bin and next week will be a different spectacle.’ Running into torrential wind and rain in the first half, Bath scored twice inside 23 minutes through Rob Webber and Leroy Houston. Micky Young of Bath holds the ball as Tom Honer of Bath kicks a conversion in windy condition . Nick Auterac of Bath is tackled by Lachlan McCaffrey as he attempts to make his way up the field . The visitors had rested their England quartet — George Ford, Jonathan Joseph, Anthony Watson and Dave Attwood — and their qualities were missed as Welsh edged back through Nic Reyonlds. They were urged on by a meagre home crowd but hopes of a comeback were dented when Nathan Trevett was sin-binned. With the biblical conditions subsiding, Bath extended their lead when Sam Burgess — who Ford revealed will be involved on Saturday — broke through two defenders. The floodgates soon opened. Houston forced his way over off the back of a scrum and, three minutes later, Alafoti Faosiliva darted through after Carl Fearns intercepted a loose pass. The Exiles’ giant No 8 Opeti Fonua, bound for Leicester next season, crashed over for a late try but the damage was long done.

Ground truth Summary: London Welsh's fate was sealed following defeat by Bath .
The Exiles lost their 18th straight match despite impressing against Bath .
Bath led 10-7 at the interval before going on to win 29-14 .

Generated Summary: London Welsh's relegation from the Aviva Premiership was confirmed following their defeat by Bath. Opeti Fonua scores a try for London Welsh during his side's 29-14 loss against Bath. The Exiles have a 653-point deficit going into the final four games of the season but this was one of their narrower defeats against a Bath side that will need to improve exponentially if they are going to challenge Leinster in this Saturday's Champions Cup quarter-final.

Article text: It is a tender moment frozen in time for at least 100 million years. Scientists have uncovered the earliest fossilised evidence of an insect caring for its young. The fossil shows a female sap-sucking scale insect, preserved in amber, carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen. The waxy ball like shapes on the abdomen of this 100 million year old insect Wathondra kotejai contain eggs and hatched nymphs and is thought  to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet discovered . The fossil, discovered in a mine in the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar, pushes back the earliest direct evidence for insects caring for their brood by more than 50 million years. It is thought to be one of the earliest examples of parental care ever discovered and may help to explain how it first began to emerge. Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive – and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them. The discovery was made after tests on the Arabidopsis plant  found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool. Researchers at the University of Missouri exposed a group of Arabidopsis, which is part of the cabbage family, to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms. Plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods, such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells. These defences are expressed in their genes. Based on the gene analysis, the scientists found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism, than if it sensed a butterfly. There were also different genetic responses to each worm, showing that the plant knew what was eating it. Professor Bo Wang, a palaeontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the research, said: 'Brood care could have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects, which occurred during the end of the Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous period during the Mesozoic era. 'Although analysis seemed to suggest that ancient insects evolved brood care, this is the first direct, unequivocal evidence for the fossil record.' The insect Wathondra kotejai is thought to date from the mid-Cretaceous period and became encased in sap from a tree that over time turned into amber. Around its abdomin are around 60 eggs and freshly hatched nymphs, encased within a wax-coated egg sack, according to the research, which is published in the journal eLife. This primitive form of brood care would have protected the young nymphs from wet and dry conditions while allowing them to mature in the relative safety of their mother. Fossilised evidence of animals caring for their young is extremely rare, especially in insects. Wingless females were largely immobile, so were less likely to be accidentally buried. A cockroach from a similar period was reported carrying a mass of eggs, but cockroaches often deposit their eggs rather than brooding them. This drawing of a brooding female Wathondara kotejai shows the ovisac containing the brood and eggs coated in a wax covering as a lumpy mass on the main part of the insects body. Amber makes it almost transparent . Researchers believe Wathondara kotejai (above) may be one of the earliest insects to care for its young . Tiny hatched nymphs can be seen scattered aaround the mother insect's body in the amber in the image above . The only other direct evidence of brood care is from Cenozoic ambers, which are thought to only extend to around 65 million years ago. The latest discovery is thought to be at least 100 million years ago and dates from a time when dinosaurs dominated the Earth. The findings may help to offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects - small limpet-like suck saping insects that are common pests on plants today. The emergence of flowing plants and ants are thought to have been crucial for the rapid evolution of many new inspect species but were not present when scale insects began to evolve. Today many insects, such as ants and bees, care for their young, while the behaviour is far less common in mammals where just six per cent of species care for their young. The insect was found encased in amber in a mine in the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar (shown above) Wathondara kotejai is an ancient ancestor this sap-sucking scale insect that are now common garden pests .

Article text: Dr Louise Selby said she was left 'speechless' at the 'blatant sexism' of Pure Gym after she was locked out of the female changing rooms . A doctor has accused a gym chain of ‘blatant sexism’ for assuming she must be a man because of her profession. Paediatrician Louise Selby was issued with a security passcode to enter her local Pure Gym branch. But the PIN repeatedly failed to work on the door to the women’s changing room because the membership management system was programmed to register anyone with the title ‘Dr’ as male. The chain – which has 90 gyms from Aberdeen to Southampton and plans to open another 40 this year – yesterday admitted that the problem is nationwide and asked any female doctors who use its facilities to contact its membership team. Dr Selby said she was ‘outraged’ when she asked staff for help at the Pure Gym in Cambridge and was told what the problem was. ‘Their archaic attitudes to women and blatant sexism really are second to none,’ she said. ‘They may have modern machines but their attitudes are firmly stuck in the early 20th century. ‘I was speechless and I’m not often speechless. If it is some sort of IT glitch then why don’t they fix it? ‘There was even an option on the [application] form to say whether you are male or female. They should offer an apology to people who are affected because it has caused offence.’ Dr Selby, 31, from Balsham, Cambridgeshire, sent a complaint to the gym’s Twitter account after having to ask other women to let her into the locker room for several weeks. Dr Selby said she had experienced sexism in the past with people assuming she is a nurse or secretary because of her sex and says there a need for change. CEO of PureGym, Humphrey Cobbold, said; 'We would like to apologise for the inconvenience and frustration caused to Dr Selby and any other female doctors who may have been affected. 'There is certainly no intention on our part to be sexist. 'There are currently more than 200,000 female members of PureGym and a large proportion of our staff are female and are absolutely an integral and essential part of our business. Dr Selby was told by staff at the gym that the code she was given to get into the women's changing rooms wouldn't work because all people with the title 'Dr' are automatically registered as men . The gym said the error was down to a 'glitch' in its system and that staff were looking into the issue . 'It is very unfortunate that an error between two of the systems we use gave the appearance that all doctors are male and we are working to ensure that this does not happen again. 'We encourage any members who have been affected by this issue to call or email our member services team.' A company spokesman refused to name the firm that supplied its IT system. A spokesman for Pure Gym said the had now removed 'Dr' from their sign up forms, and are contacting all members who are doctors in order to address any problems they are having .

Article text: Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files . A Polish man who tried to sell secret nuclear submarine documents he stole from his neighbour's airing cupboard has been jailed for more than four years. Marcin Kostrzewa was sentenced to four-and-a-half years behind bars after a jury at Plymouth Crown Court took less than an hour to find him guilty following a three day trial. The court had heard how Kostrzewa broke into neighbour Shane Spencer's flat and took the restricted files. He had become 'obsessed' with Mr Spencer after finding out he worked with subs. Marcin later stole the paperwork after using English and Polish words to search Google using terms like 'spy games, spies and secret documents'. Kostrzewa then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the information for £50,000 but was trapped in an undercover sting. He had denied committing the burglary between January and April 2014 and claimed he had found the contents in a bin as he was carrying out research for a spy novel. The 31-year-old claims he just wanted to get arrested so he could meet a real MI5 Agent. But jailing him for four and a half years, Recorder John Williams said: 'You are not the bumbling fool you have sought to portray in your evidence. 'In my view you are both calculating and clever. 'You stole and sought to sell documents which you understood to be sufficiently sensitive and no doubt secret to warrant a large amount of money.' He added that the loss of the documents could 'affect military operations' - though the metalworker tried to sell them to a friendly government. In a statement read to court, Mr Spencer said he had been suspended from his work at Devonport Dockyard for Babcock Marine. Aerial view: The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer at Devonport (above) and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines . The court heard he had lost his high level of security clearance and was thinking of moving abroad. Alexander Chalk, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the Pole had previous convictions in his home country, including robbery and burglary. He added the documents were marked restricted, the third of five classifications at the time, below top secret and secret.

Article text: (CNN)Two Chinese men have been jailed for selling military intelligence, including hundreds of photos of China's first aircraft carrier, to foreign spies, state media reported. According to the Dalian Daily, the two men, surnamed Han and Zhang, were sentenced to eight and six years in prison respectively earlier this year. The report said that Han, 30, was approached by a person claiming to be a journalist via the instant messaging app WeChat. The "reporter" assigned Han to work in a military base, taking photos of "sensitive areas" of a major military project with his phone in the name of news gathering. Last summer, he traveled to Beijing and Liaoning, in China's northeast, to take photos, including images of exhibits at a national defense technology promotion show. He later passed recordings and photos to his "employer," the report said. "Although the enemies' tricks are cunning, they are totally preventable," the paper said. When contacted by CNN, Dalian's Public Security Bureau confirmed the media report was correct but declined to give further details. The other man, Zhang, 23, had sent more than 500 pictures of the Liaoning aircraft carrier, named after the province where it was refitted, to a person who claimed to be an editor with a foreign magazine before being detained last August. Two months earlier, Zhang had quit his original job for this better-paid side job, the paper said. The paper published photographs of their "spying equipment" -- iPhones, computers and cables. Some Internet users questioned whether it was really espionage to take photos of China's aircraft carrier --  even former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel visited the vessel in 2014. "I have photos of the aircraft carrier, too," one person with the handle @gablio posted on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter. "When I flew from Dalian to Beijing two years ago, I saw the vessel clearly on the plane. Countless people have photographed it."

Article text: This baby otter is being cared for at a rescue center after it became separated from its mother and was washed up on the shore. The sea otter pup was discovered alone on a beach in Monterey, California, and was taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sea Otter Program. Professional wildlife photographer, Sebastian Kennerknecht, captured the journey a rescued otter goes through until it can be released back into the wild. Scroll down for video . This baby otter is being cared for at a rescue center in California after it became separated from its mother and was washed up on the shore . The sea otter pup was discovered alone on a beach in Monterey, California, and was taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sea Otter Program . The 29-year-old from Berkeley, California said: 'The otter pup was found stranded on a beach, with the mother nowhere to be seen. 'Without her, the pup cannot survive by itself. It needed to be brought to the Sea Otter Program to have any chance of survival.' The images show Karl Mayer, the animal care coordinator for the aquarium, bathing the two-week-old male otter after it was brought in. Mr Kennerknecht said: 'He wears a disguise to keep the pup from associating humans with the care it received. 'This ensures that the pup won't try to seek help or try to get food from humans once it is released as an adult at the end of the rescue process. 'The pup is placed in a tank to get used to the feeling of water. It is placed in this specific tank since its very secluded, quiet, and dark, giving the pup a chance to calm down after the stress of being separated from its mother and from the rescue. The Sea Otter is wrapped in fake kelp while floating in holding tank. In the wild otters wrap themselves in kelp to stop them being swept away . A male sea otter being released by Karl Mayer in Monterey Bay . 'He is then wrapped in fake kelp like that found in the Monterey Bay. The fake kelp is placed around the otter pup to start teaching the pup to wrap itself in it to keep from floating away. 'This is crucial otter behaviour in the wild, as the waves could sweep the otter away, which is probably what happened when the pup was separated from its mother. 'The pup is then taken out of the tank and Karl has given the brush to it to play with while he dries it. 'After drying it, Karl will brush it. This is incredibly important since sea otters don't have any blubber to keep them warm. 'Instead they have the thickest fur out of any mammal, but to make sure that the fur keeps them warm they need to groom it, or have it be groomed, which is something the mother normally does at this age of the pup.' Otters taken to the aquarium are not given names to stop the staff from getting too attached to them. If the otters and staff bonded it would make the process of releasing them into the wild more difficult. Another otter, an adult male, is seen being released by Karl into the wild at Elkhorn Slough in Monterey Bay after spending 11 and a half months at the aquarium. Mr Kennerknecht said: 'Getting to photograph the Sea Otter Program is an incredible experience and seeing the dedicated people care for these animals is inspiring. 'The first thought that come to mind when I saw the pup was 'can I keep it', after which I quickly thought about how sad it was that it had been separated from its mother. 'But when I saw it being released back into the wild, and subsequently playing in the surf, I realized that is where it truly belongs and was extremely overjoyed.'

Article text: Roy Keane insists the Republic of Ireland will head into Sunday's Euro 2016 showdown with surprise Group D leaders Poland with nothing but victory in mind. The Poles currently sit on top of the pile, three points clear of Germany, Scotland and Ireland having claimed the scalp of the newly-crowned world champions in Warsaw in October. Martin O'Neill's men, the Germans and the Scots are locked together behind them on seven points, but assistant manager Keane is adamant there will be only one approach as the Republic attempt to close the gap at the Aviva Stadium. Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane (centre) watches on during training at Malahide on Monday . Keane is targeting a crucial Euro 2016 qualifier victory over Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday . He said: 'A win would be nice after the disappointment of [November's 1-0 defeat in] Scotland. 'You can't have too many draws. Some days, you get good draws and bad draws, like the one in Germany is no doubt a good one. But the mindset at home is to go win the match. 'Afterwards, a draw might not be a bad result, but our mindset before the game is to go and get the win. The slip-up in Scotland is one that we don't want to cost us too much, but the mindset with the manager, staff, players and fans behind us has to be to go try win the football match.' The Aviva Stadium will be packed to the rafters on Sunday as Ireland set about their task of hoping to rekindle the memories of their last major victory on home soil, the famous 1-0 win over Holland in which Jason McAteer's goal set the nation on the road to the 2002 World Cup finals. Keane played in that game and set the tone for the afternoon when he thundered into a first-minute tackle on Marc Overmars. Darren Randolf (left) is pursued by David Forde, Cyrus Christie and Richard Keogh during the session . Asked if he could wield the same sort of influence from the sidelines this time around, he replied: 'No, I cant tackle anyone can I? 'No, it's difficult, but we have good players and good characters. Creating a good tempo in the game can come from anyone. Some days it's a tackle and others, please God, it's goals.' Lansdowne in its current incarnation has perhaps proved less of a fortress than in its past, and Keane admits the Republic have to make life more difficult for visiting teams. He said: 'It used to scare the home team! If you want to do well in any campaign, you have to have a decent home record. 'I'm guessing a lot of teams have come here and enjoyed the Aviva, but it's up to us to be on the front foot and get the fans behind us. The atmosphere will be brilliant, but it cant just come from the fans, it has to come from the players too. 'But we will be making tackles, creating chances and putting bodies on the line, and that will get fans right behind us. Stephen Quinn (left) and Kevin Doyle stretch their legs at the Republic of Ireland's team base at Gannon Park . 'The old Lansdowne was brilliant, always a great atmosphere. But in terms of the atmosphere for Sunday? That's the least of our worries. That will take care itself, I think it will be electric.' Keane met up with O'Neill, the rest of the staff and the players on Sunday for the first time since relinquishing his similar role at Aston Villa under former boss Paul Lambert, and he remains convinced he made the right decision. He said: 'I hope so, that was the aim when I left Villa, to focus on Ireland a bit more. It was a chance to get to games and see the players a bit more often, so that's not an issue. 'I was always comfortable with the decision and I felt it was right for everybody.' Keane spoke to the media after a training session in which James McClean, Stephen Ward and Darron Gibson were unable to take part because of injury, and within hours, Everton midfielder Gibson's persistent groin problem forced his withdrawal. A statement said: 'The Football Association of Ireland today confirmed that Darron Gibson has withdrawn from the Republic of Ireland squad to face Poland on March 29 due a persistent groin injury. 'Darron will return to his club today for treatment.' Full-back Ward's ankle remains a concern, but winger McClean said he is '100 per cent' sure he will be fit after a scan on his left ankle on Tuesday revealed no lasting damage.

Article text: A daredevil Swiss wingsuit flyer has jumped off the side of a mountain in pitch darkness and flown down past huge pillars of rock using only the light from two bright red flares. And the amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier. In the picture Kerber's route appears as a glowing red line running down from the top of the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain in the resort town of Engelberg in central Switzerland to the bottom. Scroll down for video . The amazing night-time flight by Patrick Kerber, 33, was not only captured on video, but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer Christian Meier . Kerber used two superheated emergency flares on the descent down the 10,000-foot Titlis mountain . The daredevil pictured at the moment he leaped into the darkness from the summit of Titlis . And just to show how dangerous jumping with the wingsuit was, Kerber made the flight during the day, showing how a wrong turn would easily have sent him crashing into one of the rocky crags that he was flying close to as he hurtled down from the mountain top. He said: 'I wanted to do a wingsuit BASE flight at night during winter for a very long time. But somehow I never really managed to do it.' The idea became reality when they decided to try and do a single photograph on a slow shutter speed and at the same time fit a light to the jumper so that the flight down the mountain could be recorded. The first problem was that it was difficult to find a light that was bright enough to be seen from a distance of one mile away, where the camera needed to be placed. They solved it, though, by using two superheated emergency flares. These also provided some light to help illuminate the way, although the intense heat also posed a risk that they might set the suit on fire. Patrick said: 'We used flares exactly like the ones used for rescue missions or emergencies. But flares burn very, very hot and my biggest fear was burning holes or melting the suit. That would have been super dangerous. To show how dangerous the jump was, Kerber did a trial run in daylight . A slight mistake would have sent Kerber crashing into craggy rocks . The wingsuit jump produced a dramatic video, with Kerber zooming down the mountain at breakneck speed . 'There definitely was a lot of pressure. Even though we did intense testing before, I did not know for sure how it would turn out. Having fire really close to you on a wingsuit BASE flight leaves no margin for error. Everything has to be worked out.' The two photographers, Fabian Wyss and Meier, stood on the other side of the valley on the Furrenalp to take the snap. Patrick also had to wait until the torches burned out before he could open the parachute. He said: 'I definitely did not want to open up my parachute with fire still around me, as this could be very dangerous. I only have one single parachute attached to me. If this one burns or melts, it's over!' Kerber decided to use two torches. The first one he ignited before he took off and held in his right hand so it would be visible to the photographer. When the torch burned out, he opened up his parachute and when it was safely in the air, ignited a second torch attached to his foot. He said: 'I only had 20 seconds to ignite the second one as it also burned for one minute and I only had 1 minute and 15 seconds to the landing area.' Patrick Kerber has jumped at night before, but not in winter and only at full moon. He said: 'The feeling was very intense and amazing. It is much harder to orientate yourself, as you can't see as well. It feels much more intense because you fly with more feeling and awareness of your body and movements.'

Article text: Fresh from being crowned World Cup champions, Australia have announced their 17-man squad to face England in the Ashes this summer. Alastair Cook and Co face a daunting prospect in trying to reclaim the urn they surrendered with such a whimper last year, especially with pace men Mitchell Starc and last year's danger man Mitchell Johnson in their prospective bowling line-up. Here, Sportsmail's cricket expert Lawrence Booth assesses the intimidating Australian squad man-by-man. Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner . Age 28 . Caps 36 . Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two. Shane Watson . Age 33 . Caps 56 . Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy. Shaun Marsh . Age 31 . Caps 12 . Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks. Mitchell Johnson . Age 33 . Caps 64 . Verdict If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. James Faulkner . Age 24 . Caps 1 . Verdict Played his only Test to date at The Oval in 2013, where he got up England’s noses by accusing them of boring batting. A left-arm seam-bowling all-rounder, he can give the ball an almighty whack. James Pattinson . Age 24 . Caps 13 . Verdict Injuries have limited him since he burst on to the scene in 2011-12, but the talent is undeniable: tall, aggressive and fast, he should trouble England more than his brother, Darren, when playing for England in a single Test against South Africa in 2008. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Brad Haddin (wkt) Age 37 . Caps 63 . Verdict Australia’s second-most important cog in their 5-0 Ashes wheel in 2013-14, after Mitchell Johnson. His sledging from behind the stumps is considered the heartbeat of the team. Chris Rogers . Age 37 . Caps 20 . Verdict This will be his last hurrah in a late-blooming Test career. Calm, compact and the perfect foil for the exuberance of his opening partner Warner. Steve Smith (vice captain) Age 25 . Caps 26 . Verdict One of world cricket’s rising stars, he scored four tons in Australia’s recent home series against India. Will captain the side full-time after Clarke retires, and can burgle the odd wicket with his leg-spin. Nathan Lyon . Age 27 . Caps 39 . Verdict A steady off-spinner who troubled England’s right-handers  during whitewash. But, really, they should have nothing to fear. Mitchell Starc . Age 25 . Caps 15 . Verdict Another left-arm seamer, and Man of the Tournament at the World Cup. His yorkers are as dangerous in Tests as they are in ODIs, and  accuracy and pace have improved. Ryan Harris . Age 35 . Caps 27 . Verdict If he can drag his injury-laden body through one final series, Australia will be thrilled. He was an unsung star during their 3-0 defeat here two years ago, and produced the ball of the series to bowl Cook in Perth. Josh Hazlewood . Age 24 . Caps 3 . Verdict One of a batch of promising Australian fast bowlers, he proved economical beyond his years during the successful World Cup campaign. A flawless action bodes well. Fawad Ahmed . Age 33 . Caps 20 . Verdict The Pakistan-born leg-spinner has played only three one-day internationals and two Twenty20 games for Australia, so would represent a risk. But Australian leggies have done well in England before… . Michael Clarke (capt) Age 33 . Caps 108 . Verdict Age has not diminished his class, as he proved in the World Cup final. But his dodgy back could be an issue in a five-Test series. Should out-captain Alastair Cook once more. David Warner . Age 28 . Caps 36 . Verdict Could win a Test or two by himself if he bats for a couple of sessions. Moeen Ali’s off-breaks will be crucial in pinning him down. Likes to say a word or two. Shane Watson . Age 33 . Caps 56 . Verdict Has a decent record in Ashes cricket, but has never reached the stage where he frightens England. But his medium-pace balances Australia’s team in a way Cook can only envy. Shaun Marsh . Age 31 . Caps 12 . Verdict A gritty left-hander, and son of former Test opener Geoff. Began Test career with 141 in Sri Lanka in 2011, but success has been sporadic since then. CV includes six ducks. Mitchell Johnson . Age 33 . Caps 64 . Verdict: If England haven’t got over the trauma of the 2013-14 series, when Johnson took 37 wickets at 13 apiece, the Ashes will stay with Australia. Peter Siddle . Age 30 . Caps 56 . Verdict The banana-loving seamer is a veteran of two Ashes tours, and could provide relentless accuracy while the quicker bowlers fire around him. Kevin Pietersen, for one, found him almost impossible to score off in 2013-14. Mitchell Marsh . Age 23 . Caps 4 . Verdict A rangy all-rounder and younger brother of Shaun, Marsh stunned England during the World Cup with figures of 5 for 33 at Melbourne – despite having taken only six ODI wickets until then. His batting is the stronger suit. Peter Nevill . Age 29 . Caps 0 . Verdict Peter who? Nevill has been chosen as the reserve wicketkeeper behind his New South Wales team-mate Haddin, although he has also played as a specialist batsman for his state team. Unlikely to get a game unless Haddin breaks a finger. Adam Voges . Age 35 . Caps 0 . Verdict An outsider for a Test debut, but he knows English conditions well – Voges has spent time with Hampshire, Middlesex and Nottinghamshire – and bowls left-arm spin to complement his middle-order hitting.

Article text: Two single beds side by side, canes hanging from coat hooks and retro British food tins on a gingham-covered countertop - these are the poignant images that capture the lives of two elderly sisters in their family home. Jean and Joy Taylor were born in the house in Ryde, Isle of Wight, in 1916 and 1922, never married and even shared a bedroom in their family home for 27 years until Jean's death in 2008. Now their quiet, old fashioned life together has been documented by a photographer Zoe Barker, with her picture series, The House Of Two Sisters. Scroll down for video . The sisters' guest room is decorated with pink candlewick bedspreads, an electric fire and family pictures on the mantelpiece. Jean's picture is in the centre, to  the right is their brother Jim in his Royal Artillery Uniform . The new owners have kept the enamelled pots and pans and other vintage pieces of kitchenware and continue to use a 'cool cupbord' with perforated metal door and sides for storing cheese, butter and eggs . Jean Taylor (left) was born, lived and died in her home in Ryde, Isle of Wight; after the loss of her sister in 2008,  Joy, now 99, (right) sold the house in 2013 to move into a care home . Barker's pictures are as much a document of the sisters' lives together and of a glimpse of a vanishing Britain. Her images  record an immaculately kept house with vintage features such as antimacassars on the armchairs, tins of treacle in the kitchen, a dressing table and highly-patterned carpets. There are no computers cluttering up surfaces, or plugs, wires and cables wending around furniture  and only a few black and white photographs  decorate on the walls. The women were born into a well-known local family, which originally set up a successful coaching business in the town in the 1840s. They also had two brothers James and John. Barker said: 'Very much a family home in the early days, the sisters shared the house with their mother and their Aunt Edie until both mother and aunt passed away. This was Jean's home all her life.' Aged 23 and 17 respectively when the Second World War broke out, the Taylor sisters came of age in an era of thrift, rationing and self-sacrifice. And their wartime experiences are evident throughout the house. The  dressing table in the twin bedroom that Jean and Joy shared. Their beds are seen reflected in the mirror . The new owners have kept the old Electrolux hoover along with the carpet that remains in this room . Jean and Joy shared a bedroom from the 1950s until Jean's death. The  picture on the wall is of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who was never found after bailing out over the sea near Dunkirk . Both of their brothers survived the war and there is a picture of James, who served in North Africa and Italy while John fought in the jungles of Burma, on the guest bedroom mantelpiece. In their neat, almost spartan, room is a black and white photo of their family friend and Spitfire pilot George Gribble who victory-rolled over the house whenever he flew over the island. On 4 June, 1941, he was seen to bail out over the sea near Dunkirk but was never found. The smaller photograph in the corner of the same frame is Bill Tudhope, a bomber pilot who was engaged to one of their cousins. He failed to return from a bombing mission over Germany in 1940. Barker said: 'In 1957 Joy left to live in London, though returned to the house almost every weekend. On retiring in 1981 she returned to live with her sister and they remained there together until Jean's death. 'Neither of them ever married. Despite being a large house the sisters shared a bedroom right up until Jean passed away.' These plastic flowers were given to the sisters by the grandmother of the woman who delivered their lunches in the last two years of Jean's life. Niece Gill remembers how impractical these armchair 'tables' were andmugs of tea would slip off unless held on to tightly . Joy Taylor sold the house in 2013 but her coat still hangs on the coat rack along with the sisters' canes (left); the women hung their Sunday best dresses on the back of the bedroom door (right). Their niece Gill, who says her aunts were always smart dressers, remembers Jean wearing this two-piece on warm summer days . The Isle of Wight-based photographer was asked to take her camera around the house  by the new owners after Joy - the last of the Taylor family in Ryde - sold her house in 2013 to move into a care home. She said: 'The new owners are lovely - a middle-aged couple with a teenage daughter. They are all massive appreciators of old things so it couldn't be in better hands. 'They've kept a lot of the sisters' furniture and objects, selected from the things that the sisters' family didn't want, many of which are currently in storage, but they plan to display them around the house once the decorating is completed. 'They invited me to come and document the house precisely because they appreciated it all so much - they really wanted a record of how it was. I presented them with an album of photographs at the end of the project.' The pictures took first place in the Documentary Series Category at the British Life Photography Awards this month. The new owners of the house have kept this Fowler's Treacle tin and many other old containers including over-the-counter medicines and salves, with a view to displaying them in the house in future . The sisters  had an identical much-loved chair and even Joy isn't sure whether this one was hers or Jean's . Barker documented the interior before it was renovated. She said: 'Little had changed for many years and the house was full of wonderfully dated features. But the house won't be entirely transformed. 'They're keeping the essentials of the house the same - lots of paint required and a few new curtains and carpets, but pretty minimal really as they want the house to retain its wonderful character,' she said. 'For example, keeping the woodchip wallpaper, just giving it a lick of paint, and holding on to some of those amazingly dated carpets. Even the old hoover has been kept as it's working perfectly. 'The biggest change is the kitchen - it was absolutely tiny, a galley kitchen really: the kitchen pans photograph was only just about doable with a wide angle lens and the camera right against the opposite wall. So the old sitting room is now a wonderfully spacious kitchen with window out on to the garden.' The rug was made by Aunt Edie's long-term boyfriend 'Uncle Bert'. The pair stepped out every Wednesday afternoon until he passed away but they never married. The blue china dog also belonged to Aunt Edie .

King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain arrive at the ceremony welcoming the Colombian president to Spain . Queen Letizia of Spain (right) and Colombian president's wife Maria Clemencia Rodriguez (left) followed their husbands during the official ceremony welcoming the South American leaders to Madrid . The mother-of-two teamed a nude blouse with a nude and black patterned pencil skirt and patent nude heels. Her coat was an elegant tailored wool affair and she held a discreet black leather clutch. As usual, the Spanish royal opted for small pearl drop earrings, while her hair was worn in a simple side parting. Her South American counterpart, Maria Clemencia Rodriguez went for a grey dress with matching pearl-studded biker-style jacket. Queen Letizia and husband Felipe welcomed their Colombian counterparts on a three-day visit to Spain . From left to right, Queen Letizia of Spain, Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia, King Felipe VI of Spain and Maria Clemencia Rodriguez, the first lady of Colombia on the steps of La Zarzuela palace . The women walked behind their husbands and seemed to have plenty to talk during the stately event which was then followed by an official luncheon at La Zarzuela Palace. The foursome reviewed the troops and listened to their national anthems to kick off Santos's three-day long visit to Spain. No doubt Letizia, a former top newspaper and TV journalist had much to discuss with Santos, who is the former deputy director of El Tiempo, the main Colombian newspaper. Just last week, art-lover Letizia and her husband attended the 34th ARCO International Contemporary Art Fair at the IFEMA exhibition site in the Spanish capital, which will feature Colombian artists this year.

She's a royal who's garnered a firm fashion following and with outfits like this, it's easy to see why Queen Letizia's style goes down such a storm. We love the way she's introduced a slight edginess to her look thanks to the studded dress which puts a fresh spin on the otherwise classic colour block design. Her chic frock is by one of her favourite designers, Felipe Varela, who's designs she often turns to for public appearances. That said, we love the fact she also champions the Spanish high-street by regularly wearing brands like Zara, Uterque and Mango. Love Letizia's dress too?

At the event, which will run until 1 March, Letizia gazed at one piece made up of a vast canvas covered in red paint, nailed to the wall, which appeared to drip into a red pool on the floor where lay clustered a paint roller, pots and brushes. Letizia and her regal husband are no strangers to events celebrating art and culture, they recently attended the inauguration of a a Picasso exhibition at the Museo de Belas Artes in A Coruna in the north west coastal region of Galicia.

The pair also attended the Picasso Museum in Malaga on Spain's Costa del Sol, in September, before attending a formal dinner . Earlier this week Letizia attended a meeting with the board of the Royal Council on Disability. One of Letizia's favoured causes, the mother-of-two appeared deep in concentration as she listened to the points raised by her fellow board members.

Article text: Three weeks after the disturbing video footage taken on the Paris Metro which shamed Chelsea an initiative is gathering support among fans to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to club. Paris Saint-Germain visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg of a Champions League tie which will be forever tarnished by those Chelsea supporters who refused to let Souleymane S board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station as they sang: 'We're racist and that's the way we like it'. Many Chelsea fans are keen to use the return fixture to send a collective message around the world, and have been inspired to produce flags, banners, posters and T-shirts to project the mood. An initiative is gathering support to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to Chelsea . Chelsea fans inside Stamford Bridge hold a poster saying: 'No racism at the Bridge. That's the way we like it!' There will be posters handed out, printed in both English and French which state: 'No Racism at the Bridge. That's the way we like it.' There will be T-shirts carrying the slogan 'We Only See Blue' and there will be flag hanging from the Matthew Harding Stand bearing a message: 'Blues Against Racism'. Souleymane has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend the game but it is as if bearing witness to his experience, like something from Apartheid South Africa lurking amid the glitz of the Champions League, flicked a switch in the minds of thousands. Rather than cringe and ignore the ever-diminishing faction of racists who have lingered around Chelsea since the 1980s – and other clubs, it must be said - supporters are getting active at ground-level with campaigns which has the potential to be more powerful than all those well-intentioned messages from the top of society. Since the Metro footage went viral, another two incidents of racist abuse involving Chelsea-associated yobs singing on trains have been reported to police and are being investigated. Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for the Shamen,  poses in a 'We only see Blue' T-Shirt . Chelsea's programme cover for the match carried a clear message: 'We are all blue #equality' Chelsea supporters display a banner which reads 'We are all Blue' ahead of the match . Ben Price, a 37-year-old gardener and Chelsea supporter since the early '90s, set up a Facebook page which he found gathered rapid support at home and abroad. Paul Canoville, the club's first black player, was quick to back the movement, as was Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for The Shamen, who is a Chelsea fan. Price was responsible for the 'No Racism at the Bridge' posters on show during the Burnley game, last month, and will be outside the Shed End, handing out more before Wednesday night's game against PSG. 'It's a message that says that collectively we do not tolerate racism and we cannot be branded a racist club,' said Price. 'It's a message for Souleymane S and for other clubs and their fans and for football's authorities like UEFA and FIFA and hopefully we can send it around the world, because the eyes of the world will be on us.' Chelsea captain John Terry wears a 'Support Chelsea, Support Equality' ahead of the clash against PSG . Chelsea fans unfurled a 'Black or white, we're all blue' banner during last month's clash at home to Burnley . West, who flew in from his home in Los Angeles, said: 'What we saw in Paris disgusted 99.99per cent of Chelsea fans. I've worked against racism all my life. The Shamen were playing at anti-racism rallies in the early-90s. 'I DJ around the world, in countries as diverse as Russia and Colombia. Everything I stand for in my art and my music has been equality and unity and bringing people together. 'To see this happen to the club I've supported for 39 years and to Chelsea fans all over the world broke my heart. It killed me. I was depressed for days and I am Mr Positive. You don't get more positive than me. We sang about moving mountains. 'I was angry that these numbskulls, these drunken idiots, were dragging our multi-racial club through the mud. It hurt. And it tarnishes English football, not just Chelsea, and it is important fans stand up against this handful of people.' West, who flew in from his home in Los Angeles said the scenes in Paris disgusted most Chelsea fans . Phil Keefe, who made one of the flags with his daughter Jodie, said: 'We talked about it and decided we had to do something. I used to come to Chelsea when the National Front sold newspapers outside the Shed. There is no way I want my club to be targeted again by those kinds of people.' Chelsea have extended their Stamford Bridge invitation to Souleymane S after he declined an opportunity to attend Wednesday night's second leg. 'I don't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me,' Souleymane S, who declined to reveal his surname, told RTL radio. 'I won't go. They can't buy me with a little piece of paper. I'm not a child.' A Chelsea spokesman said: 'We appreciate he doesn't want to come to this particular game, however, our offer remains open and we hope he'll take us up on it so he can meet real Chelsea fans and experience the true spirit of the club.' Chelsea's programme cover for the match carried a clear message: 'We are all blue #equality.'

Article text: In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday night the Australian businessman accused of masterminding an international paedophile ring revealed he is writing a journal that will serve as a confession for his alleged depraved crimes. Speaking from behind bars to 60 Minutes' Tara Brown, Peter Gerard Scully, 52, was evasive, non-committal and vague throughout the interview. But Scully hoped that the journal he was writing would help explain his mental state and the motivations behind his actions. He was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, and killing another young girl, leading to calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty. Scroll down for videos . Peter Gerard Scully, 52, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old . Relaxed and in control throughout the interview, Scully kept referring to a journal that he was now writing in prison and that the reasons for his horrific actions that he details in it could only be explained by a psychiatrist. 'What I'm looking for is the real reason why I took that road and what drove me to that, because in Australia I wasn't like that,' he said. However, for every direct question Ms Brown had, Scully had an equally opaque answer. 'I don't want to get into any of that... Are we almost done? Because we seem to be going round in circles,' he said at one stage. Asked by Ms Brown if he had any remorse for his actions he said that he did, but could not say exactly when he felt this. 'That's a good question. There's different degrees of remorse when you finally realise what you have done,' he said. ‘At what point do you have remorse? I can't answer that honestly yet.' When pressed on why he did what he did his only answer was to 'ask the psychiatrist that question'. 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Ms Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Brown went behind bars to face Scully in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, where Scully is currently being held, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The father-of-two slipped out of Melbourne after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. Videos seized in the Philippines last week, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy', allegedly show a 13-year-old girl being forced to perform 'horrific' acts of whipping and torture with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The 60 Minutes team was on the ground when Scully was arrested after the remains of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon and authorities, who had been keeping the 51-year-old under surveillance, swooped on his house. 'We went inside his house of horrors, right into the heart of darkness to understand exactly why it was so important that he was taken off the street,' said Ms Brown. 60 Minutes Tara Brown went behind bars in the Phillipines to speak to the alleged paedeophile . Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 13 children and causing the death of another . Scully is accused of feeding a global market of paedophilic videos, charging up to $10,000 for footage of children being tortured and abused by other underage victims. Ms Brown claimed that several of the young girls who were groomed by Scully became partners in his video ring, falling 'into his net, manipulated to become girlfriends and later accomplices', including Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 'Part of me feels sorry for them, but I can't understand taking it to the next step into torture and possibly murder,' she said. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, allegedly approached two cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie. She offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened,' Scully said earlier in the week . 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Tara Brown . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. 'You don't want to overuse the word monster, but that is what he is. He is the face of global perversion' said Ms Brown. 'This story is so confronting, it's a story about all lines being crossed, not just once, but repeatedly. We are talking about the sexual abuse of an 11-month-old, and the misery and lead up to the alleged death of another,' she said. Ms Brown said that Scully, a father of two grown children, claims to have remorse for his crimes. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened. That is something to talk about in the court which is the proper forum. There's nothing I can do to change what they [the girls] said,' Scully told The Sydney Morning Herald earlier in the week. Ms Brown said that as a mother of two young boys she is very aware of how 'innocent and trusting young people are'. 'It adds to the tragedy. It's almost beyond belief that there is something so dark within some people and when they act on that it's the most innocent that are their victims,' she said.

'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Scully said that he isn't concerned about being sentenced to life in prison. 'If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control,' he said. 'I get bigger than Ben-Hur and people get interested. There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?' Scully said. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.

Article text: An elderly widow has been evicted from her home of 46 years because her son could not afford to pay the mortgage. Pensioner Mary Heywood, 84, from Southampton, was forced to pack her belongings and leave her house after her son, Philip, could not afford the mortgage repayments on the home. Once the pensioner was ushered by bailiffs into a waiting taxi, locksmiths moved in and changed the locks on the £190,000 terraced house as building society Nationwide took possession of it. Widow Mary Heywood, 84, (pictured) was forced to leave her house and was ushered by bailiffs into a taxi (pictured) after her son could no longer afford to pay the mortgage on her home of 46 years . The moment her son Philip (pictured left) and Mrs Heywood (right) are evicted from the Southampton home . Nationwide have said they offered numerous times to come to an arrangement with the family living at the property when they began struggling with mortgage repayments. Mrs Heywood and her son Philip, 54, got behind on payments when Mr Heywood got into financial difficulties. Mrs Heywood bought the house with her late husband Ernest in 1969. Mrs Heywood bought the house (pictured) with her late husband Ernest in 1969 . Their only son Philip, a self employed computer programmer, took charge of the mortgage payments from his elderly father in 2004. But he cut back his working hours when his father was hospitalised and eventually died in 2011, aged 84. Mr Heywood said he struggled to cope with the loss of his father, and work began to dry up as the debts rose to tens of thousands of pounds. He said the eviction was the climax of a legacy of huge debts racked up following the death of his father. He said: 'It's my fault that it's got to this point, I've handled things badly and perhaps I've made some bad decisions. 'I just wish that I could turn back time. I've lived here almost all my life so it's part of my life.' Building society Nationwide said it took action after serving its fourth and final eviction notice and making continued attempts to forge a deal. Nationwide reclaimed the house after Mr Heywood failed to find the money, a new job or alternative employment. A spokeswoman for Nationwide said the organisation had shown 'significant forbearance' over a long period of time. They said: 'This is a case where we have gone above and beyond what would be expected of a reasonable lender and have made numerous attempts to help Mr Heywood find a solution which works for him and for the society. 'We do, though, owe it to our wider membership to ensure that we do not sustain losses from such situations as, over time, this will affect the viability and sustainability of their building society.' It is unclear where Mr Heywood and his mother are staying. A spokesman for Southampton City Council urged the elderly woman to get in touch with them. She said: 'We will do our best to help a resident in such a situation and urgently encourage them to contact our homelessness unit as soon as possible for an assessment.'

Article text: Only Gordon Ramsay could take asparagus, fructose and shiitake mushrooms and come up with a recipe for teaching his children how to swear without causing offence. The chef, known for his use of expletives, has revealed he is teaching daughters Megan, Matilda and Holly and son Jack ‘some really nice alternatives to curse words’. Ramsay, presenter of The F Word on Channel 4, tells them to say ‘shiitake’ instead of ‘s***’, ‘asparagus’ instead of ‘a**’ and ‘fructose’ in place of ‘f***’. Recipe for not swearing: Gordon Ramsay (with wife Tana, second left) has revealed he is teaching his children (from left) Holly, Megan, Matilda and Jack 'some really nice alternatives to curse words' Ramsay's kitchen alternatives: They say ‘shiitake’ (left) instead of ‘s***’, and ‘asparagus’ (right) instead of ‘a**’ But the 48-year-old admitted that at his last parents’ evening, one of the children’s teachers said that it was still offensive and that he should stop. Ramsay said that he replied: ‘I said: ‘Well it’s a Japanese mushroom, it’s delicious, now f*** off.’’ The chef has long been known for his bad language - but this is the first time that he has admitted that he is teaching the same to his children, who are aged between 12 and 16. In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live in the US, he said: ‘I tried to teach them some side language. Known for his use of expletives: The chef, who was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland, has gained fame on shows such as Hell's Kitchen and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares . 'So I said: "Look, cursing is not smart, it’s an industry language and sometimes daddy lets it slip - 20 times a day." So I come up with some really nice sort of alternatives to curse words. 'So rather than saying the word s***, which you know, is not nice - shiitake. And instead of the F word? Fructose. Rather than saying a**, it’s asparagus.’ Ramsay has admitted to unconventional parenting in the past and has told his children that cooking is a ‘life skill’ - and is more important than passing exams. He was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland, and moved out of home at 16 because of his abusive alcoholic father - gaining fame on shows such as Hell's Kitchen and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.

Article text: Manuel Pellegrini has told James Milner to meet Manchester City halfway as their contract negotiations continue to drag on. The England midfielder, who joined the club from Aston Villa for £26million in 2010, is stalling over a new deal with the Premier League champions and his future at the Etihad appears to be increasingly uncertain. Milner, 29, is reluctant to commit to what could be the last big contract of his career while he still has concerns over his first-team opportunities at City. He will be a free agent in the summer and has been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool, as well as a number of clubs in Italy and Spain. James Milner is a versatile and popular member of City's squad but talks of a new deal have hit the rocks . Pellegrini had been hopeful that Milner’s situation would be resolved by now but seemed less optimistic when asked about it on Friday. The City boss indicated that the ball is in Milner’s court and the club are unlikely to improve their offer. ‘I don’t have any news about James Milner,’ he said. ‘To decide to sign a contract you need both parties to agree it. We will see what happens from now until the end of the season. Manuel Pellegrini has asked Milner to meet the club in the middle after the factions have reached an impasse . ‘Maybe City have already offered all that the club can offer. Maybe it’s not about more money, maybe there are different things to sign a new contract. ‘You must ask James what is happening with him. I hope he will find an arrangement, but you cannot talk about City only.’

Article text: DIY giant B&Q announced today it is to shut one in six of its least profitable stores after its annual profits fell £75million last year. The home improvement chain  is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Shares in Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in the UK, jumped up 16p each - a five per cent rise - when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Changes: B&Q is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business . Parent company Kingfisher, which also owns Screwfix, plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360-strong B&Q estate. The move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to £675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to £11billion in the year to January 31. This is down from 744million in the 2013-14 year. The planned store closures form part of a plan by new Chief Executive Veronique Laury to shake-up the 360-store B&Q business. Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, made a pre-tax profit of 675 million pounds  in the year to January 31.The results are the first to be presented by Laury, who succeeded Ian Cheshire in December. Veronique Laury said the closure plan was one of a number of 'sharp' decisions being taken by the FTSE 100 company. She added: 'Home improvement is a great market with huge potential and Kingfisher has a strong position within it with further scope to grow in a sustainable way. However, it is clear to me that we need to organise ourselves very differently to unlock our potential.' Other plans include cutting back on some of the 393,000 products sold across the company, particularly as only 7,000 - amounting to 7 per cent of sales - are currently sold in at least two of Kingfisher's operating companies. The company will also look to optimise vacant store space and is in discussions with several retailers about sub-letting opportunities. Kingfisher said the impact on jobs from the B&Q store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the Screwfix brand, while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business. Ms Laury denied that the UK DIY market was in decline and said the store closure plan reflected a desire to reinvigorate the company's UK offer. She added that it had long been clear that B&Q had too many stores in its estate. B&Q UK & Ireland's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to £3.7 billion in the financial year, with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent. Profits were 16 per cent higher at £276million. In contrast, profits in France were 12 per cent lower at £349 million due to the impact of weak consumer confidence and a declining housing and construction market. Kingfisher said it will close a small number of stores in the country. It came as Kingfisher, which had a binding agreement to buy French rival Mr Bricolage, was forced to pull out of the £200m deal. The acquisition had been referred to competition authorities because Kingfisher already owns Castorama and Brico Depot in France. While it had the backing of a key shareholder, support was withdrawn by franchisee group the Association Nationale des Promoteurs du Faites Le Vous-Même (ANPF), which holds a 42pc stake in Mr Bricolage. Forty-four of Mr Bricolage's 500 stores, many of them franchises, would had to have been sold to placate regulators. It has since emerged that today was the deadline for the deal and all parties had to agree if there was an extension.

Its annual profits were down £75m to £675m to the end of January .

Article text: U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, waves before she delivers opening remarks during an appearance at Waseda University in Tokyo on Wednesday . Japanese police were investigating phone calls threatening to kill U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and another American envoy, authorities said on Wednesday. Tokyo police were investigating calls to the U.S. Embassy threatening to kill Kennedy and similar ones targeting Alfred Magleby, the U.S. consul general based on the southern island of Okinawa, according to police sources. Tokyo police declined to comment. The embassy also did not comment, citing policy regarding the ambassador's security. Kennedy was due to meet with First Lady Michelle Obama on her arrival in Tokyo on Wednesday to promote her 'Let Girls Learn' education initiative. Obama's arrival coincided with a speech made by former U.S. President Bill Clinton at a Tokyo university on Wednesday afternoon alongside Kennedy and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as they attended a symposium on the legacy of assassinated John F. Kennedy. Okinawa is home to about half of the 50,000 American troops based in Japan. Japanese media reports said that the death threats came last month from a caller speaking in English, and that police were looking into the case on suspicion of blackmailing. No other details, including motives, were known. Kennedy was due to meet with First Lady Michelle Obama on her arrival in Tokyo on Wednesday (pictured) to promote her 'Let Girls Learn' education initiative . CBS reported that JFK's daughter was often seen mixing freely with crowds during her high-profile outings in Japan. The State Department said in a statement on Thursday: 'We take any threats to U.S. diplomats seriously. 'We take every step possible to protect our personnel. We are working with the Japanese government to ensure the necessary measures are in place. We will not comment on the specific details of any threats or the steps we take to address them.' Earlier this month, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was knifed by an anti-U.S. activist in Seoul and had to be hospitalized for several days. Lippert suffered a deep facial gash and stab wound to his wrist after being attacked by a knife-wielding pro-North Korean activist during a breakfast forum. Former US President Bill Clinton was also in attendance at the Tokyo event on Wednesday.

Article text: Marijuana is much stronger than it was three decades ago, experts have warned. Scientists found cannabis smoked today has tripled in strength since the 1980s. Marijuana now contains increasingly high concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound which gives the 'high'. But concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD), a lesser known compound that is being investigated for its medical proponents, but does not create a 'high', has gone down. Samples also contained contaminants including bacteria, fungi, butane and heavy metals, scientists found. Scroll down for video . Super strong: Marijuana sold on the market today has tripled in strength since the 1980s, scientists  warn . The research was carried out by Dr Andy LaFrate, the president and director of research of Charas Scientific, a lab in Colorado, US, which carries out potency testing on marijuana samples on the market today. Presenting his preliminary findings at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), he found that marijuana has tripled in strength in the last 30 years. He said: 'We've seen a big increase in marijuana potency compared to where it was 20 or 30 years ago. 'I would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of three.' The average potencies of the samples he analysed was 20 per cent THC, but he saw  values close to 30 per cent, which he described as'huge'. He explained that 30 years ago, THC levels in marijuana were well below 10 per cent. The THC content of cannabis has tripled in some strains because producers have been cross-breeding them over the years as users demand stronger drugs, he said. He added that an unexpected consequence of the breeding was that many of the samples his lab tested contained little to no CBD. Researchers are currently investigating CBD as a treatment for schizophrenia, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as anxiety and depression. But unlike THC, CBD doesn't get provide the same 'high', which is why it could be considered in treatments for children. Extra potent: Concentrations of marijuana's active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (pictured) have increased from less than 10 per cent in samples from the 1980s to up to 30 per cent in samples tested today . Dr LaFrate said he was shocked by the levels of contaminants in samples of marijuana producers had voluntarily sent to the lab for testing. He said: 'One thing that's been surprising is the level of microbial contamination in marijuana.' 'Many of the samples were covered in fungi or bacterial contaminants. 'Others had Butane, which are used to create marijuana extracts, and others had heavy metals.' This isn't necessarily a cause for alarm, but it could spark discussions on what are safe levels of contaminants. Dr LaFrate said: 'It's a natural product. There's going to be microbial growth on it no matter what you do. 'So the questions become: What's a safe threshold? And which contaminants do we need to be concerned about?'

Article text: (CNN)Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star, claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family, vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-Semitic remarks. In the lawsuit Jeffrey and Suzanne Schwartz say Bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face after he complained about the pop star driving his Ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in Calabasas, California. The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also alleges Bieber's bodyguards dismissed Jeffrey Schwartz's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with "what are you going to do about it, Jew boy?" The suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. Representatives for Bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon. The lawsuit comes after Bieber, 21, pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a January 9, 2014 incident in which the Schwartzes' house was pelted with dozens of eggs. Bieber agreed to pay $80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years' probation. It's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol, who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his ATV collided with a minivan last August in Canada. Thursday's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of "offensive" behavior by Bieber and members of his entourage from March 2013 to January 2014. The Schwartzes, who lived next door to Bieber, claim the harassment escalated after a March 27, 2013 episode in which Bieber spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face and threatened to "f---ing kill" him. The following year, after the egging episode made headlines, the Schwartzes say they and their children were subject to "constant harassment" by Bieber's entourage, fans and the media. The couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. Bieber sold the Calabasas house for $7. 2 million last year to Khloe Kardashian and has since been renting a $60,000-a-month home in Beverly Hills, according to Forbes.

Article text: Only one in three people routinely see police officers patrolling their neighbourhood, a new report has revealed. Critics said the shocking statistics sounded the death knell for the traditional Dixon Of Dock Green-style beat bobby pounding Britain’s streets. Police chiefs warned the fall in police visibility would get worse if threatened major budget cuts are pushed through after the general election. But Home Secretary Theresa May has argued that since the Coalition’s austerity drive began in 2010, crime has tumbled – showing police forces have successfully continued to crack offending despite being ordered to make savings. Scroll down for video . Decline: Just 32 per cent of people saw a police foot patrol at least once a week in 2013-14 . The research, published by the Office For National Statistics yesterday also found one in five people think it is ‘likely’ they will become a victim of crime over the next 12 months amid concerns over community safety. The most damning finding was the dwindling number of police officers or police community support officers (PCSOs) seen on foot patrols since the Coalition came to power. Experts say not only does neighbourhood policing help catch criminals, it also deters offending, makes the public feel safe and strengthens links between the police and communities. But only 32 per cent of people saw bobbies on the beat at least once a week in 2013-14, compared to 40 per cent in 2010-11. And while the proportion who saw officers on foot once a month rose from 34 per cent to 40 per cent, the number never seeing them at all rose from 25 per cent to 28 per cent. The figures coincide with a fall in the number of police officers and PCSOs from 161,000 to around 140,000 since ministers began their austerity drive. Fear: One in five people said they thought it 'likely' they would be a victim of crime in the next year - a feeling at odds with Home Secretary Theresa May's assertion that crime has dropped since the cuts came in . There has been a reduction of 20 per cent since 2011 in the amount spent by the Home Office on the police. Constabularies are also bracing themselves for further cuts amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds after the election. David Green, criminologist and founder of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘Theresa May has said police time is being used more efficiently and there is less waste but this shows they have cut so far that it is starting to reduce police visibility. ‘It means the policy of neighbourhood policing, which was very popular, has become if not quite a dead letter, then severely weakened by the reductions in police strength.’ Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said: ‘Neighbourhood policing – the bedrock of British policing – is being eroded. There has been a reduction of 20 per cent since 2011 in the amount spent by the Home Office on the police - and chiefs warn foot patrols will decrease more if further cuts are made . ‘The Government claims that they have increased the proportion of police officers on the frontline. The public see it different with fewer people saying that they regularly see bobbies on the beat.’ Steve White, chairman of Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘This underlines the sad fact that, although the public highly values the work that police officers do to keep them safe, they are seeing fewer and fewer of them around on the street. ‘It represents a sad indictment of the Government’s policing policies. Quite clearly, cuts have consequences and the government cuts have severely damaged the service’s ability to keep people safe and lock up criminals.’ Last month police unions in the West Midlands warned police cuts meant bobbies on the beat had become ‘an endangered species’. The ONS survey found the proportion of people who felt positively about the police rose from 59 per cent in 2010-11 to 63 per cent last year, while those who had confidence in the police rose from 72 per cent to 76 per cent. According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, based on people’s experiences of crime, overall crime had fallen 25 per cent since 2010-11 to 7.1million incidents, the lowest since 1981. The total number of crimes reported to forces in England and Wales has fallen from 4.1million to 3.7million over the same period. Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a fifth since 2010. Citizens and communities are safer than at any point since the survey began. ‘Under this Government, police forces have shown that, with reform, it is possible to deliver more with less. ‘The police watchdog has made clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided. What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are.’

Samantha Stuhlener gave birth to baby Levi at St Vincent's Private Hospital in the inner city Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy in January, but was handed another child to hold before nurses noticed the mix-up 45 minutes later. She and husband Chris revealed her story to Seven News on Tuesday night, but social media has since been flooded with comments accusing Mrs Stuhlener of overreacting. While some commenters have sided with the upset parents of the young boy - who have complained they have struggled to bond with their son who they say is often unsettled - others had harsh words for Mrs Stuhlener. Scroll down for video . Levi was born on January 6 this year to proud parents Samantha and Nick Stuhlener at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Fitzroy . His mother, Samantha Stuhlener, has had trouble bonding with her cherished baby after a mix up at the hospital which saw her mistakenly spend 45 minutes with someone else's child . 'Nurses are overworked and underpaid. It was an honest accident. Get over it,' wrote one woman. 'He was unsettled for 7 weeks after birth?! Oh my! That sounds... LIKE A NEWBORN', another posted. Others told the parents they should 'get some perspective' and mentioned those who were not so fortunate as to have a healthy child. 'While this shouldn't happen and is far from ideal, I don't think it is the end of the world. The babies weren't harmed and weren't left alone. Sad for the mum, yes. I would choose this over my son being still born any day,' one posted. Commenters have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the situation . Many posts have criticised the reaction of the parents . One woman wrote that while it was a bad thing that happened, other situations could be worse . 'Last week all we heard about was a young couple losing their 4 week old bub to whooping cough. THAT is traumatic. This is not. It happens more than you realise. Perhaps the reason the child was not settling is because the mother wasn't focussing on him, instead of focussing on what she didn't have - a measly 45 minutes. Get a little perspective', another wrote. 'I just think of all the poor mums who have to wait a week or more to hold their babies because they were born too early or are sick,' one more posted. However some commenters were more sympathetic towards the Stuhlener's, agreeing that the first moments with a child are precious, and they were robbed of sharing those with Levi. Some have asked the parents to be grateful for the fact they have a healthy happy child . Quite a few posts related to the fact that the Stuhlener family were lucky to have a well little boy . But others were much more sympathetic to the experience of the new parents . 'Some of the comments on here are heartless... this is a once in a lifetime precious moment. She can't get that back now. That first moment you get to bond with your child is magical, nothing comes close,' one viewer wrote. On Tuesday the Stuhlener family told their story, revealing that the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple's baby, after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the 'settling room'. 'I said what's happened, what's going on?' Ms Stuhlener told 7News. 'And she said, you didn't have Levi, you had somebody else's baby.' The two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at St Vincent's Private Hospital . The error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought Mr and Mrs Stuhlener someone else's child. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff. 'It is extremely regrettable and our staff and myself feel gutted by the incident. We unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident,' he told 7News. He emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched, fed and changed by their parents. 'While both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times, the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands,' Mr Grisold said. Both children were wearing the correct ID wrist bands in the overnight settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the Stuhleners someone else's child . 'The second baby remained in the night nursery. 'When it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room, the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents. 'At no time was either baby picked up, held or fed by anyone other than their parents.' The hospital has told the distraught parents that Levi remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant. However, the Stuhleners are demanding the truth. 'I don't believe that,' Ms Stuhlener told 7News, unable to hold back tears. 'I don't know, was he (Levi) with another mother?' They have become suspicious as St Vincent's Hospital staff allegedly refuse to show the couple the incident report, which details where their baby was throughout the incident. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff . 'That's all we've wanted, to actually see what's written in the incident report and what actually happened,' said Mr Stuhlener. To make matters worse, the hospital's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix-up. Mr and Mrs Stuhlener received a letter of apology and $500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error. However, the hospital sent them the wrong letter. They received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap – the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes. 'I acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family,' Mr Griswold confirmed. The Stuhleners claim to have been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised' The Stuhleners say they've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'. The couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family. Ms Stuhlener says she has had more difficulty bonding with Levi than she did with her firstborn. Their son, now almost three months old, was 'unsettled' for the first several weeks of his life and did not take to breastfeeding. St Vincent's Private Hospital have changed their procedures to try ensure the error is not repeated. Two staff members are now required to cross check both the mother and baby's name tags when moving babies to and from the settling room.

Article text: Detectives investigating claims of a VIP paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to Enoch Powell. The late Tory MP, who was one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century, was named in a Church of England review into historic sex abuse. The claims relate to allegations of satanic rituals, often involving the abuse of children. Scroll down for video . Allegation: Detectives investigating claims of a VIP paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to Enoch Powell, above . Powell is one of several high-profile names passed to Scotland Yard by Bishop of Durham Paul Butler, who is leading the review. The Bishop has also handed detectives the name of Leo Abse, the flamboyant Welsh MP who died in 2008 aged 91. Last night the Church of England confirmed that both names had been passed on to detectives from Operation Fernbridge, a Metropolitan Police inquiry into an alleged Westminster VIP paedophile network. The Right Rev Butler was given the politicians’ names by Dominic Walker, former Bishop of Monmouth, who heard the allegations when he was a vicar counselling in the 1980s. Mr Walker told senior clerics that Abse was named by three abuse survivors whom he counselled when he was a vicar in Brighton in the 1980s. He also passed on the names of two former Conservative cabinet ministers, who have not yet been publicly linked to the scandal. Mr Walker was questioned by the Right Rev Butler after the discovery of a book from 1991 in which he described counselling sessions with adult survivors. Powell is one of several high-profile names passed to Scotland Yard by Bishop of Durham Paul Butler, above, who is leading the review . ‘A number of survivors independently gave the name of a particular MP being involved,’ he said, adding. ‘I don’t believe there was any collusion in their stories.’ A Church of England spokesman said: ‘The name Enoch Powell was passed to Operation Fernbridge on the instruction of Bishop Paul Butler.’ In 1994, an investigation by the London School of Economics into 84 alleged cases of ‘satanic abuse’ in the UK between 1987 and 1992 found no convincing corroborative evidence. The claims against Powell and Abse have emerged amid mounting claims of a paedophile network involving Establishment figures, which was allegedly covered up by Special Branch. Police are to be given access to secret files held on MPs in the House of Commons archives to help their search for evidence on suspected abusers, including former Liberal MP Cyril Smith. Enoch Powell’s frontline political career ended in 1968 after he made his ‘rivers of blood’ speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration. Tory leader Edward Heath sacked him from the shadow cabinet the following day, although Powell remained a Tory MP until 1974. SIMON HEFFER: Monstrous slur against my friend . Four years before he died in 1998, Enoch Powell did me the honour of asking me to write his biography. I spoke to almost everyone alive who knew him. When he died, I had unique access to a vast collection of private papers, including numerous intimate letters. If there is anyone alive other than Enoch’s widow and daughters who knows more about him than I do, I’d like to meet him. I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell, writes Simon Heffer . I never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about Powell. His probity in personal and financial matters was rock solid. When on Saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the Church of England, my first instinct was to laugh: but that soon changed into utter outrage when I realised he was serious. The Church has publicly accused Enoch of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay, without the slightest evidence. They might as well accuse him of having been a war criminal or an armed robber, for there would be as much truth in either allegation. The appalling slurs are just like those made against 91-year-old Lord Bramall, a D-Day veteran and former chief of defence staff, whose homes in London and North Yorkshire were gratuitously raided by police recently on the back of an unspecified allegation of a sexual nature dating back to the 1970s. It is not just that the bishops who have made these accusations are behaving in a remarkably un-Christian fashion by putting this smear into the public domain. But that they do not appear even to have engaged what passes for their brains, or consciences, before behaving in this grotesque and offensive fashion. Their brains should have told them that a man of Enoch’s controversial reputation would never for a moment have got away with the type of behaviour they are alleging he indulged in during the 1980s. The Establishment turned against Enoch in 1968 after the so-called Rivers of Blood speech; it would never have protected him for a second had it detected the slightest whiff of scandal. Their consciences should have told them that to make such an outrageous allegation about an enormously distinguished public figure who cannot defend himself, and which would cause the deepest distress to his family and friends, was the height of mischief and irresponsibility. It is disgraceful and destabilising for clergy to behave in this way, and the Church needs to investigate those responsible for this smear and take action accordingly. These post-Savile accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including notorious cases in Rochdale and the Orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids. When the London School of Economics investigated 84 alleged cases, it found no convincing corroborative evidence of any abuse – yet families had been torn apart on the say-so of those who insisted action be taken. Enoch Powell, pictured making a speech in 1977, has been named in a Church of England review into historic sex abuse . For decades, Enoch Powell has long been a bug-bear of the liberal Establishment. He has been demonised not least because to attack his memory is a quick and effective way for them to score points by setting out their own political correctness. What better way for some mischievous Leftist priest to damage Enoch further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse? In 1998, just after Enoch died, the BBC broadcast a programme in which they railed at Enoch for his hypocrisy. They said this scourge of mass immigration had visited the West Indies in 1953 to recruit black labour for the NHS. I was told of the story before the programme was broadcast and informed its researcher that Enoch had never been to the West Indies in his life. I was told, effectively, that I was lying, and it was broadcast. A black clergywoman, then resident in London, talked at length of Enoch having recruited her as a nurse. The story was rubbish. Detailed investigation by the BBC complaints department found that the woman had been recruited after a visit to her island by Jack Profumo, not Enoch Powell at all, and the Corporation was forced to make a grovelling on-air apology in peak time. I have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and Establishment figures would stop manipulating Enoch’s memory for their own advantage. But I never thought I would hear of bishops of the Church of England doing it. The allegations are a monstrous lie. That the lie appears to have been retailed by a priest is beyond contempt. There must be an investigation and, for all the distress this outrage has caused, there must be a reckoning.

Article text: A team from a Spanish university . has discovered what Egyptian  authorities are calling the . world's oldest evidence of breast cancer in the 4,200-year-old . skeleton of an adult woman. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the . woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed . 'an extraordinary deterioration'. 'The study of her remains shows the typical destructive . damage provoked by the extension of a breast cancer as a . metastasis,' he said in a statement on Tuesday. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed'an extraordinary deterioration'. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. Despite being one of the world's leading causes of death . today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records . compared to other diseases - which has given rise to the idea . that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to . people living for longer. 'The team from University of Jaen has confirmed that the woman lived at the end of the 6th Dynasty (2200 BCE) and was part of the élite of the southernmost town of Egypt, Elephantine,' the statement said. 'The virulence of the disease impeded her to carry out any kind of labor, but she was treated and taken care during a long period until her death. ' The University of Jaen began the archaeological excavations in Qubbet el-Hawa in 2008 and their major goal is to reconstruct the life and funerary rituals of the governors of Elephantine and their families who lived between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen saidthe Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town. But the finding, along with evidence reported last year by . British researchers of metastatic cancer in a 3,000-year-old . skeleton found in a tomb in modern Sudan, suggests cancer was . around in the Nile Valley in ancient times. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said . the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the . country's southernmost town. Her remains were discovered in the necropolis of Qubbet . el-Hawa, west of the southern city of Aswan, the ministry said. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research . agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year . in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town (pictured) Other analysis - including examination of the last food found in the stomachs of three horses buried in her tomb - allowed Dr Polesmak to formulate an intriguing account of this woman's final months alive . Last year a unique MRI scan on a 2,500 year old mummified Siberian 'princess' has revealed she died after suffering from acute breast cancer. Preserved in ice in an elaborate grave in the Altai Mountains, the ancient woman - famous for her remarkable tattoos - took cannabis to dull the ravages of her illnesses, experts have also discovered. Dug from her permafrost burial chamber on the high Ukok Plateau in 1993, analysis of her remains earlier highlighted sophisticated tattoos of 'great artistry' of fantastical creatures, while in her tomb was also found clothing and headdresses, a make-up bag, and a stash of cannabis, enabling experts to build a detailed picture of her life and looks. Separately from the MRI, academics also conclude she was a virgin who lived a deliberately 'celibate' life.

Article text: Two American tourists have been arrested for carving initials into the Colosseum in Rome. Before they were spotted, the women, 21 and 25, were able to carve a J and an N into a brick wall on the first floor of the west side of the Colosseum. After carving the eight-inch high letters, the women posed together for a selfie. The women, just two of six million tourists that flock to the Colosseum every year, used a coin to engrave the letters, La Stampa reported. They are said to have broken away from their tour group before - but other tourists saw what had happened and alerted security. Police charged the women with 'aggravated damage on building of historical and artistic interest', according to Republica. After they were caught, the women  apologized to Piazza Dante police and Captain Lorenzo Iacobone. They said: 'We apologize for what we did. We regret it but we did not imagine it was something so serious. 'We'll remember for a lifetime.' According to the Guardian, the section damaged dates back to the 1800s - a key period of restoration. A spokesman for the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome is quoted as saying: 'It’s not an original wall but it’s nevertheless antique.' With approximately six million visitors to the Colosseum each year and ever-increasing staff cuts, policing the site has become a major problem. Sadly many of the stones bear the unsightly engravings of tourists keen to leave their mark. The Californians’ lawbreaking comes little over three months after a Russian tourist was caught carving a 25cm letter into the Colosseum. The 42-year-old was given a four-month suspended prison sentence and a €20,000 fine, although owing to a lack of funds he has not paid the penalty. Two tourists from the United States were caught engraving their initials at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy . The women were charged with 'aggravated damage on a building of historical and artistic interest' on Saturday . He was said to be the fifth tourist seen defacing the Colosseum in 2014. A father and son from Australia and teenagers from Brazil and Canada were also caught out last year. Built in the first century CE, the Colosseum is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site. In order to make the  UNESCO list, a site must have a special cultural or physical significance. The Colosseum, which is also called the Flavian Amphitheatre, was named after a colossal statue that once stood nearby. The structure 'accommodated games of great popular appeal, such as hunts and gladiatorial fights' until the end of the Ancient Age, according to the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome. The organization adds: 'The building was, and still is today, a show in itself. 'In fact, it is the largest amphitheatre not only in the city of Rome but in the world, able to offer stunning sceneries as well as services for spectators.'

Article text: Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao is the fight which just keeps on giving. Especially to Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. The initial projection of a purse split of $150million to the Money man and $100m to the PacMan has just been upwardly revised by Pacquiao's promoter. Bob Arum is now predicting a '$300m distribution' to the protagonists - $180m to Mayweather and $120m to Pacquiao under their 60-40 percent agreement. Floyd Mayweather could earn $180m from his May 2 fight with Manny Pacquiao given the huge public interest . Pacquiao will receive 40 per cent of the purse, which could hit $120m on projected record pay-per-view buys . Mayweather laughs while watching the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Boston Celtics . Those figures are based on Arum's firm expectation that this, the richest fight of all time, will not just break the pay-per-view record in America – but double it. He says: 'We are looking at four to five million buys. The interest is amazing, even from people who do not follow boxing, even people who don't follow any sports. 'Wherever you go everyone is talking about this fight.' They are also bending his ear for tickets in the 16,000-capacity MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2. Arum has already told a host of A-list celebrities: 'No comps this time. The demand is so huge that the only answer is everyone has to pay.' The only free ticket promised by Arum is for female UFC star Ronda Rousey, who he heard was preparing to spend all her career fight winnings thus far on a seat as close to ringside as that amount could buy. Promoter Bob Arum believes there will be between 'four and five million buys' of the fight on May 2 . Arum has only promised one free ticket to the Las Vegas showdown - to UFC star Ronda Rousey . Pacquiao, pictured working out in Minila, has already started preparing for his fight with Mayweather . Tickets are expected to be priced from the lowest at $1,250 to upwards of $6,000 for a seat at ringside. But it is unlikely any at all will go on general sale. Purchases may well be restricted to those holding a $250,000 credit line, or higher, at the MGM group of casinos on the Strip. Although there will of course be a thriving black market at eye-watering prices. Speaking at an ESPN fights night in New York state, Arum said: 'One guy offered me a hundred grand for a ticket.' Then he joked: 'I told him he could have my seat for $200,000.' The double-up factor will begin with the Grand Garden taking $40m at the box office, compared with the previous high-mark of $20m for Mayweather v Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in September 2013. But it is the pay-per-view TV sales – with rival networks HBO and Showtime sharing the broadcast – which will generate most of the revenue. The record number of buys stands at 2.4m for Mayweather v Oscar De La Hoya eight years ago. Oscar De La Hoya's fight with Mayweather in 2007 holds the record for the most pay-per-view buys at 2.4m . Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau in November last year . Mayweather's last fight came when he beat Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas in September 2014 . Naturally the charge has risen substantially since then, probably to $99.95 per subscription. Thus Arum's five million buys – along with such ancillary income as TV rights overseas, including Britain - would make this 'The Half-Billion Dollar Fight'. That would generate $200m to be shared among the likes of the local broadcasting stations, the MGM hosts, the promoters, the undercard fighters and so on. As for the $300m to the two best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, Arum says: 'Floyd loves cars and he could buy so many as to satisfy very dealer in Las Vegas. A lot of Manny's money is going to charity in the Philippines.'

Article text: A man who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority, from not having seen what it is expected a man should see. So said Samuel Johnson, who was forever ready with a suitable aphorism. Suitable, that is, if you were living in the 18th Century, when the rich and titled minority wafted around Florence and Rome as part of their Grand Tour, allowing travel to broaden their minds before bringing back new ideas to influence our architecture, landscape and gardening. The cities they visited overflowed with statues and art, some of which they bought on the cheap, or pinched when the Italians were looking the other way. Though Tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded, it’s still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories (pictured: San Gimignano and its towers) Johnson would be surprised to see how popular Italian cities have become nowadays: visitors are well advised to arrive outside the summer peak when sightseeing can be hard (and sometimes positively dangerous given the rise of the selfie-stick – the ultimate stupidity of modern- day tourism). E. M. Forster took a wry look at the early days of mass tourism to Italy at the end of the 19th Century in A Room With A View. When the young heroine Lucy Honeychurch finds herself in the church of Santa Croce without her Baedeker guidebook, Forster is expressing the horror of the intellectual at the worrying rise of the ‘uneducated’ tourist. He went so far as to wonder whether there ought to be some sort of intelligence test imposed at Dover to weed out the truly stupid traveller. But today’s tourists don’t come to Tuscany so much to learn as to ‘experience’. The treasures of the Uffizi or an up-close sight of David in Florence’s Accademia Gallery are stirring in their own right – you don’t really need to know their place in the history of Renaissance art in order to enjoy them. Chianciano Terme was called Fontes Clusinae by the Romans, and they made use of its thermal springs . In Florence you can assimilate the art and savour it, just as you might imbibe a glass of fine Italian wine. The problem is that at busy times, it’s hard to find the space to enjoy either the art or the wine. But though Tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded, it’s still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories. Mine are of a pleasant three-star hotel in a place named Chianciano Terme, about 50 miles south-east of Siena, which was our base. The Romans called it Fontes Clusinae, and made use of its thermal springs, as visitors still do. I have good memories, too, of the Tuscan landscape, with its well-tended fields and vineyards, its olive groves and cypress trees. I like being in a countryside that has not been neglected, or turned into a theme park for townies. In this regard, Tuscany is rewarding. The ‘Chianti Classico’ area, which lies between Florence and Siena, still looks much as it was when it was painted by the great Renaissance artists who assumed that the Holy Land must have looked a lot like Tuscany – so this is what you see in the background of various scenes of holy birth and crucifixion. As you pass through this land, you enjoy divine views across glorious sprawling vineyards; a view occasionally interrupted by stunningly picturesque castles. Writer John Carter's tour leader called Tuscany's Sam Gimignano 'a medieval Manhattan' Of course, other countries have beautiful landscapes, but few can match Tuscany for its sublime, gentle sweetness. Leonardo was born in the small town of Vinci which lies in this magnificent scenery – a final confirmation that the area is touched by genius. We ate well, naturally, and drank moderately well, too. Some of my fellow travellers discovered a red wine named Nobile di Montepulciano, which they found most acceptable. Our base was just five miles or so from Montepulciano, so supplies were guaranteed. We went to San Gimignano, which our tour leader called ‘a medieval Manhattan’ – and it wasn’t the first time I’d heard it described that way, unfortunately. Its towers are most impressive, though it seems to take a greater pride in its ice cream. We liked San Gimignano, mainly because there weren’t so many people, but also because we were left to our own devices and could make up our own minds about the place without being told all sorts of stuff by a local guide. I’m in two minds about local guides. They do tell you lots of useful things, but have a tendency to tell you too much, so everything blurs. Travelsphere (travelsphere.co.uk, 0800 987 5110) offers and eight-day Treasures Of Tuscany tour with prices starting from £604. This includes return flights from Gatwick, transfers, half-board, accommodation, transport and some excursions. Florence provided a good example of this. The guide there told us about artists and sculptors and architects and the ruling families of medieval times. She gave the names of the buildings and their histories. And dates; masses of dates. At the end of it all, I was most confused. But the guide never mentioned the Florence that might have made English visitors prick up their ears. Indeed, she had never even heard of Florence Nightingale who was born in that city and was given its name. The Nightingale family had a penchant for strange first names: Florence’s elder sister Parthenope was called after an ancient name for Naples, where the family was living at the time of her birth. I suppose that both girls were glad that at the time of their births, the family had not been living in Croydon… .

Article text: The Ohio mother who allegedly beheaded her three-month-old baby has been released from hospital and booked into jail on aggravated murder charges. Deasia Watkins, 20, said nothing as she appeared handcuffed and in a yellow jumpsuit before a Hamilton County judge on Friday morning. Her bond was set at $500,000. A grand jury will hear evidence in the case on March 26 and will decide on an indictment. She is accused of decapitating her daughter Janiyah at her aunt's College Hill home on Monday morning before placing the knife in the child's hand and going to bed. After her family found the grisly scene, Watkins, who had previously been ordered to stay away from the child after being hospitalized with psychiatric problems, was taken to hospital for evaluation. In court: Deasia Watkins, who has been charged with aggravated murder in the beheading death of her baby daughter, said nothing at her first court appearance in Hamilton County, Ohio on Friday . On Thursday evening, she was released and taken to Hamilton County Jail. While she was under guard at Deaconess Hospital, Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said that she was not talking to authorities. 'She's like a zombie,' he told WCPO. 'We're hoping to get her some medication so she can begin talking. 'Until she gets in front of some doctors and talks, it's going to be very difficult to know what her motivation was. No matter what the motivation was, no one is going to be able to explain this.' Watkins gave birth to baby Janiyah in December and was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis in January after police responded to a report that she was screaming in her apartment. Watkins, left, allegedly murdered three-month-old Janiyah, right, at her aunt's Ohio home on Monday . She was ultimately ordered to keep away from the child, who was handed over to her aunt, and family services caseworkers said they believe Watkins may not have been taking her medication, which could have caused delusional thinking. Deters said it is believed Watkins moved in with her aunt about a week before the murder. On Monday, the aunt's son dropped his children off at the house so they could catch the bus and a five-year-old boy entered the home and found the murdered baby on a kitchen counter. Janiyah had been stabbed at least 15 times across her body and had a fractured arms, the coroner revealed. The five-year-old boy ran outside to get his father, who then woke up Watkins' aunt, and together they called 911. 'Somebody please send the police!' the aunt can be heard begging in the chilling 911 call. 'My niece killed our baby! Please! Help me!' Scene: Watkins was staying at her aunt's College Hill, Ohio home (pictured) when she allegedly murdered the baby. Police found Watkins in bed and covered in blood when they responded to her aunt's 911 call . Overcome with emotion, she is unable to speak and her son takes the phone. The 911 dispatcher presses him for details about what happened. 'Lady, the baby is on my mom's kitchen counter with its head smashed,' the man says. 'Can you please just send the police as fast as you can.' When the dispatcher pushes for more information, he says: 'Look, lady. I don't want to describe the scene. The [scene] is very, very bad, alright? The little baby's head is open. Like, open open. 'I'm not going in there to touch nothing, because I don't want to mess nothing up. I'm not going in there to look, because I've already seen it. But it's very violent. It's a very violent scene.' Police arrived at the College Hill home to find the decapitated baby and Watkins in bed. Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December and the baby's father, James Brown, told WCPO she 'just started acting different' about a month after the birth. He said she had been 'acting crazy lately, speaking of demons', according to a court document. Shock: Janiyah's father, James Brown, said his girlfriend started acting differently a month after the baby's birth. He had also been ordered to keep away from the child, who authorities said was neglected . Tragedy: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said . On January 24, police responded to a report of her screaming and the baby crying at their home. Watkins appeared to be under the influence of marijuana and refused to let go of the child, court documents said. But Janiyah was taken by emergency personnel after Watkins passed out with her eyes open. Friend Chris Gulley was also at the apartment at the time and told WCPO that Watkins was calling him and Brown the devil. 'She kept saying we were sinning so much, we didn't realize we were sinning,' Gulley said. 'We need to come to the light and see what God wanted us to do and all that.' She was hospitalized briefly and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication, court documents state. On March 6, a juvenile court magistrate the girl to be taken from her mother for the child's protection and placed in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services. Behind bars: Watkins is now being held at Hamilton County Jail, pictured, on $500,000 bond . Brown, whose paternity has not been established, was also ordered to stay away from the child when the court found both parents were neglectful. Social workers checked on the baby girl once a week - at least 10 times in total - and warned relatives to keep Watkings away from her before the murder, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. Deters said at a press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs 'but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7'. He added that he wasn't sure anyone else would be charged. The aunt may be needed as a witness, he said. WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.
