All article text:In a statement, President Trump said visas would once again be issued once "the most secure policies" were in place, and denied it was a Muslim ban.
The move has been widely condemned.
Sixteen state attorneys general have said the order is unconstitutional. Several federal judges have temporarily halted the deportation of visa holders.
Live: Protests over ban
Mr Trump's executive order, signed on Friday, halted the entire US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely banned Syrian refugees, and suspended all nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries.
Those who were already mid-flight were detained on arrival - even if they held valid US visas or other immigration permits. It is not known how many others were turned away at airports overseas as they tried to board flights to the US.
Thousands gathered at airports around the country to protest on Saturday, including lawyers who offered their services for free to those affected.
Further demonstrations were held on Sunday, including protests outside the White House and Trump Tower in New York.
As well as the ban on all refugees, travellers who have nationality or dual nationality of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are not permitted to enter the US for 90 days, or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa.
This includes those who share dual nationality with allied countries, including the UK, although Canada has been told its dual nationals are not affected.
But there remains much confusion.
The UK foreign office put out a statement saying that only those dual nationals travelling from one of the blacklisted seven countries would be subject to extra checks - those travelling between the UK and US would not be affected.
However, one Scottish veterinary student - who travels on an Iranian passport - was unable to fly home from her holiday in Costa Rica because she was told her transit visa for the US was no longer valid.
White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said US green-card holders - legal residents - would also not be affected, but some have been detained since the order came into effect.
Mr Trump tweeted early on Sunday that the US needed "extreme vetting, NOW" but later, in a statement, tried to offer more reassuring words, saying: "This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe.
"We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days," he said.
Mr Priebus rejected criticism that the implementation of the order had been chaotic, and said only 109 people, out of 325,000 travelling, had been detained and "most of those people were moved out".
"We've got a couple of dozen more that remain and I would suspect that as long as they're not awful people that they will move through before another half a day today," he told US media on Sunday.
But they have failed to allay concern among some in their Republican party. The Republican chair of the US Senate Foreign Relations committee, Senator Bob Corker, said the executive order had been "poorly implemented", particularly for green-card holders, and the "administration should make appropriate revisions".
Democratic Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said the US now appeared "less humanitarian, less safe, less American" and said the Democrats would introduce legislation to overturn it.
Fear, uncertainty and small acts of rebellion at Dulles airport  - BBC's Jessica Lussenhop in Washington DC
Ali worked for three years as an interpreter for the US Army and gained admittance to the US through a Special Immigrant Visa. He now has a green card, and returned to Iraq for his father's funeral, only to be delayed for hours for questioning at Dulles.
"We are not terrorists. We are not bad people," said Ali. "It's so hard. I hope they will change their minds on this position."

In a joint statement, 16 attorneys general, from states including California, New York and Pennsylvania, said they would "use all of the tools of our offices to fight this unconstitutional order" and, until it was struck down, would "work to ensure that as few people as possible suffer from the chaotic situation that it has created".
Late on Saturday, federal Judge Ann Donnelly, in New York, ruled against the removal from the US of people with approved refugee applications, valid visas, and "other individuals... legally authorised to enter the United States".
She was ruling on a case brought on behalf of two Iraqi men with links to the US military who were detained at JFK Airport in New York, who were later released.
Elsewhere in the US:
The Department of Homeland Security has said it will continue to enforce the measures.
History will judge the long-term impact of Mr Trump's Friday afternoon immigration order, but his early praise for its implementation will not easily be forgotten.
"It's working out very nicely," he said in a brief response to a question on Saturday afternoon. On the ground at major US airports, things weren't going quite so nicely, however.

Criticism of Mr Trump's decision has been growing louder outside the US.
Canada is offering temporary residence to those stranded there because of the US order, the immigration minister said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier tweeted that Canada welcomed "those fleeing persecution, terror and war".
Iran is threatening a reciprocal ban on US citizens entering the country. Similar comments came out of Iraq, with whom the US is working to drive IS out of Mosul.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said "even the necessary, determined fight against terrorism does not justify placing people of a certain origin or belief under general suspicion".
A spokesperson for UK PM Theresa May said she "did not agree" with the restrictions, and French independent presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron tweeted: "I stand with the people fleeing war and persecution."

All article text:Their study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, argued elderly people had the least to gain.
The team at University College London (UCL) has called on doctors to discuss the risks more clearly with patients.
The charity Diabetes UK said doctors needed to strike a careful balance when prescribing treatment.
Type-2 diabetes is an inability to control blood sugar levels and is linked to lifestyle factors including diet and obesity.
In the long-term it is linked to heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage and even blindness.
Drugs such as metformin can be used to lower blood sugar levels to prevent the side effects.
The report, which was carried out by the University of Michigan as well as UCL, said an average 45-year-old who dropped their blood sugar levels by one percentage point would gain 10 months of healthy life, compared with three weeks for a 75-year-old starting treatment.
It added this needed to be balanced against the down-sides to a lifetime of medication including: Having to have multiple injections and blood sugar tests each day, drugs causing indigestion or sickness, or insulin treatments risking blood sugar levels dropping dangerously low (hypoglycaemia).
One of the report's authors, Prof John Yudkin, told the BBC: "What it means is if you're someone with type-2, it's your right to know what the benefits of the treatment are in terms of gain in life expectancy or reduction in heart attacks or going blind.
"And then you are entitled to decide, but not many doctors have got those figures to hand."
He said GPs were too "target focussed" and were often looking only at the blood sugar level.
The findings do not apply to people with type-1 diabetes.
Commenting on the report, Simon O'Neill, the director for health intelligence at Diabetes UK, said: "Sometimes there is a balance to be struck where certain medications might help give someone a longer life, but also cause side effects that might negatively impact on quality of life.
"This study highlights the importance of looking at the individual needs of the person with type-2 diabetes, rather than adopting a blanket approach."
Patients are advised not to make any decisions without consulting their GP.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises the NHS on medication, said: "The current NICE guidance on the management of type-2 diabetes recognises that glycaemic [sugar] control targets should not impair a person's quality of life as a result of the side effects of treatment.
"Where medication does not help achieve this target level, lifestyle therapies such as dietary advice should be offered."
Refreshed guidelines are due to be published next summer.

All article text:He joined ITV's breakfast show when it launched as a sports reporter and presenter and went on to present Good Morning Britain on Saturdays.
He became anchorman of Good Morning Britain in 1987 and presented Yorkshire TV's news magazine programme Calendar until 2002
ITV's Daybreak presenter and former colleague Lorraine Kelly said he will be "very, very, very sadly missed".
"Mike was a delightful man, he was such a generous presenter - he really was brilliant," she said.
"The good thing about him was he didn't make a big fuss or a song and dance, he made it look easy. And I think in some ways he was under-rated because of that."
She added that her many memories of him were of "mostly just laughing".
Morris was born in Harrow, north-west London, in June 1947 and started his journalistic career with the Surrey Comet in 1969.
He worked for the Reuters news agency, United Newspapers and Thames TV, editing and reporting on both news and sport stories.
After joining TV-am in 1983 as a sports presenter, he quickly moved up the ranks - first hosting the Saturday edition of Good Morning Britain before graduating to the main daily show in 1987.
He interviewed Nelson Mandela eight days after his release from jail in South Africa and presented the programme the morning after the Lockerbie bombing.
His TV-am co-host Anne Diamond said: "I presented many, many memorable breakfast television programmes with Mike and I'd just like to say, as a way of tribute, what a lovely, lovely man he was.
"He was incredibly popular, I think, because he was just like the guy next door.
"It was completely sincere image he had of just being the ordinary bloke next door, who asked the ordinary bloke-type questions.
"That endeared him to a great many people. It certainly did to me.
"He was always a gentleman, he was always generous. He was very, very funny. A real family man and I must say I'm terribly sad to hear he has died."
As the presenter with last words on the final TV-am show in December 1992, Morris joked that he was "off to be a passport photographer after turning off the studio lights".
Writing on behalf of TV-am, journalist Ian White said Morris was "no ordinary journalist" who was "popular with viewers".
"He had the common touch and the ability to pull off every type of interview, often under incredible pressure.
"TV-am's success was partly down to its presenters and in the last five years Mike helped lead that team on and off the air. He will be greatly missed by family, friends and colleagues," he said.
Morris is survived by his daughters Sarah and Helen.

He went on the run after failing to return to prison in 2012, but later gave himself up. He also absconded from open prison in 2001.
Members of the public are being advised not to approach Frater, who "could present a risk to the public".
Det Supt Jez Noyce, of Dorset Police, said: "There may be various reasons why he has not complied with his release from prison licence conditions and I appeal to him directly to make contact with police at the earliest opportunity.
"I'd like to assure members of the public that officers are making every effort to find this man as soon as possible".
Frater was convicted stabbing Mr du Rose when the teacher chased him from the garden of his home following a robbery at a nearby shop.
He is described as white, of medium build, 5ft 8ins tall, with short, receding, brown hair.

All article text:Contractions in the construction and production industries were balanced out by a growth in services.
UK GDP grew by 0.4% over the same period.
Scottish GDP per person - which takes population changes into account - was also flat during the first quarter of 2016.
During the first three months of the year services in Scotland grew by 0.4%, while production contracted by 1.2% and construction by 1.5%.
On an annual basis, Scotland's economy grew by 0.6%, compared with UK growth of 2%.
The figures were compiled by Scotland's chief statistician.
The GDP figures were released on the same day as official data showed that unemployment in Scotland fell by 18,000 between March and May.
A leading economic forecaster described the two sets of figures as "a mixed bag" for the Scottish economy.
Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said growth had been "stagnant"  over the first three months of the year.
"While the all-important services sectors grew, there was a sharp fall in production and construction," he said.
"Of greatest concern was the fall in manufacturing, which was down 2.6% over the three months and 5.4% over the year. This was the sharpest fall in annual manufacturing output since the 2008/09 financial crisis.
"On the plus side, revisions to the data paint a rosier picture of growth last year. The Scottish economy is now estimated to have grown in each and every quarter of 2015, with growth of 1.4% in 2015 up from the previous estimate of just +0.9%.
"Despite that, Scotland continued to lag behind the UK as a whole."
Responding to the GDP figures, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called for "a concerted government response to Scotland's growth problems and swift clarification of the position of EU nationals working in the UK".
Chief executive Liz Cameron said: "Scotland's growth has now been at a fraction of that of the UK as a whole for a full year and there are few signs of a major improvement in sight.
"In the light of the EU referendum result, the Scottish and UK governments must take all steps necessary to support businesses at this time and help them to invest for the future and get our economy back on the path of growth."
The Federation of Small Businesses said the growth figures presented a challenge.
Scottish policy convener Andy Willox said: "These pre-referendum figures demonstrate that the Scottish economy was underperforming before the vote.
"Business surveys and feedback suggest that some investment plans and deals have been put on hold as a consequence of recent economic and political turbulence.
"As Number 10 and Bute House draw up plans to restore business confidence, they must think about community firms as well as the stock market.
"They must shelve proposals that would give business owners headaches and think about local infrastructure as well as large national projects."
In a report released last week, accountancy firm PwC downgraded its growth forecasts for Scotland's economy.
It suggested house prices were set to fall north of the border amid an economic slowdown - but a recession would be avoided.

All article text:Government plans would give applicants a right to complain to an employment tribunal if they believed they had suffered discrimination.
Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to create "a culture of openness" where staff feel they can speak up about patient safety.
Barrister Sir Robert Francis recommended the measure after a public inquiry into Stafford Hospital deaths.
Protecting NHS whistleblowers was a key recommendation from the inquiry into the scandal, which resulted in the trust that ran Stafford Hospital being fined Â£500,000 for "basic" blunders linked to the deaths of four patients.
Sir Robert, the inquiry chairman, warned that staff often faced bullying and isolation if they tried to speak out and that staff struggled to find new jobs in the NHS.
Under the UK-wide plans, applicants for an NHS job would have the right to complain to an employment tribunal if they had been discriminated against because they had previously raised concerns about the safety of patients.
Applicants would also have the right to bring a claim in court in order to prevent discriminatory conduct.
And the draft guidelines, which are out for consultation, say that discrimination of an applicant by an NHS worker should be treated like discrimination by the NHS body itself.
Health Secretary Mr Hunt said: "Today we move another step closer to creating a culture of openness in the NHS, where people who have the courage to speak up about patient safety concerns are listened to, not vilified."
He said the changes would ensure "staff feel they are protected with the law on their side".
There has been a growing focus on patient safety since Sir Robert's inquiry in 2013.
One of the main findings of that report was that people within the NHS had known about the poor levels of care at the hospital, but did not raise the alarm.
Since then, a number of initiatives have been launched to improve safety.
In 2015, the government introduced plans to appoint guardians to support staff who wanted to speak up about concerns over patient safety.
Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, said the plans were modest, but a "welcome move in the right direction".
"It is clearly unfair that staff who have been forced to become 'whistleblowers' should be discriminated against when they seek alternative jobs.
"However, this is a symptom of a much deeper cultural problem in the NHS which will not be solved with tinkering with rules here and there.
"So far we have not seen a joined-up approach to supporting and protecting staff from unfair treatment when they try to do the right thing and end up having to be whistleblowers."
Mr Walsh said many NHS trusts had still not appointed guardians, as recommended by the Stafford Hospital inquiry.
The current consultation is open for eight weeks and will close on 12 May.

All article text:Sir Bob Kerslake said one of the difficulties was that "easier" savings had already been made.
He said the "sense of urgency" would be reduced and the need for cuts would be hard to explain to public sector staff.
Sir Bob stepped down from his role this month and was replaced by former Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood.
He said the civil service had "excelled" during his time in charge.
Speaking at the Institute for Government think tank, he said it was clear that "under any government, we face up to a further five years of austerity in public sector spending".
"The first five years have been challenging but the second five years are likely to prove even harder for three reasons," he said.
"Firstly, the easier savings have already been made.
"Secondly, we are likely to be doing it against a background of a growing economy and greater competition for good staff.
"Thirdly, the sense of urgency that underpinned the first savings programme will be reduced.
"In reality, the task is not yet complete. But this will be hard to explain to those in the public sector, including our own staff, who are looking for some relief."
Sir Bob said the civil service had "excelled" in its challenge to "deliver big programme savings at the same time as undergoing huge change and reduction itself".
The roles of cabinet secretary and head of the civil service were split into two jobs when Sir Gus O'Donnell retired as both in 2012.
Sir Bob, who was already permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), took the role as head of the civil service at that time.
He will retire from his DCLG role early next year.

A teenager at one walkabout said the prince had responded by saying "he was thinking about having two".
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also said they would like their "superhero superpower" to be invisibility.
The prince, who married Catherine Middleton in April last year, has spoken before about starting a family, but has not mentioned numbers.
After the couple's visit to the Gardens by the Bay attraction, Corine Ackermann, 17, said: "Someone asked him how many children he would like to have, and he said he was thinking about having two."
Jaz Heber Percy, 13, asked the prince what superpower he would like to have if he could be a superhero.
The prince replied: "That's a hard question - I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. I think invisibility."
The duchess had agreed that she would need to be invisible too, "otherwise he would be able to sneak up on her," Jaz said.
Several people in the 1,000-strong crowd fainted as they waited in sweltering heat for three hours to see the royals.
Local children who had been given the morning off school chanted: "Will, you're brill. Kate, you're great".
The royal couple planted a Pachira glabra variegata tree to mark their visit.
They also visited a Rolls-Royce jet engine factory, where the prince praised the "cutting-edge aerospace technology developed by one of the United Kingdom's great global companies".
During the visit, the duchess fitted the last of 24 fan blades to a Trent 900 engine.

All article text:Some 39,723 homes were repossessed by bailiffs in the 12 months to September 2016 - equivalent to 108 per day, Ministry of Justice data says.
It adds that 137,773 renting households are at risk of losing their homes.
Homelessness charity Shelter blamed benefit cuts and affordable housing shortages, but the government said reasons for evictions were complex.
Although the number of households evicted has dipped slightly since the peak of 42,054 in 2015, Shelter says the statistics are still very worrying.
Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: "The news that tens of thousands of renters have been evicted from their homes in the last year is a sobering reminder of the impact of welfare cuts and the severe lack of affordable homes.
"Our deepening housing crisis means that over 120,000 children will wake up homeless this Christmas, and sadly this shows that not far behind them are many more families still desperately fighting to stay in their home.
"Our helpline advisers can make the difference between a family losing their home and keeping it, but we are finding it increasingly tough to keep up with soaring demand."
The majority of claims for home repossession in the year to September 2016 were from social landlords, at 60%, while 15% were by private landlords.
The remaining 25% of claims were made under the accelerated procedure, which can be used by both private and social landlords in certain circumstances.
A government official said: "The latest figures show that all stages of landlord repossessions have gone down compared to the last quarter.
"We are committed to building the homes this country needs and have doubled the housing budget to Â£8bn to build 400,000 more affordable homes.
"The reasons for repossessions can be complex, so to link it to welfare reform is misleading.
"Our reforms are incentivising work and restoring fairness to the system, and we continue to spend over Â£90bn a year supporting working age people who are out of work, disabled or a carer, bringing up a family or on a low income."
But Shelter said social sector evictions had risen in conjunction with the introduction of the bedroom tax and that homelessness acceptances, caused by the loss of private tenancy, have soared since cuts were made to the amount of housing benefit people receive.
Chris Town, vice chairman of the Residential Landlords Association, said landlords did not spend their time looking for ways of evicting tenants.
"Seeking to regain possession of a property can be a long and stressful process for both tenants and landlords. Landlords will usually only ever seek possession for a few reasons - either tenants who are not paying their rent or committing anti-social behaviour, the landlord wants to renovate a property, or wants to sell."

All article text:Francisco Marcolino married his maid of decades, Rita Monteiro, 52, in northern Portugal on 4 May.
But three children from his previous marriage claim she is eyeing his €2m (£1.7m; $2.2m) estate and that he is not of sound mind.
"If he had wanted to marry, he would have done it when he was capable," his son told Portuguese media.
The children are trying to annul the marriage on grounds of incapacity - though a fourth is refusing to join the action and has not commented.
Ms Monteiro was hired by Mr Marcolino's wife 30 years ago, two years before she died.
According to Manuel Marcolino de Jesus, one of three children who have filed the lawsuit, his father's health has sharply deteriorated over the past few years.
His father has made several emergency trips to the local hospital, where his files say he suffers dementia and is totally dependent, Manuel Marcolino said.
"They have lived in [Ms Monteiro's] house since he became incapable five years ago, and that is when she started to take over everything," he told Portugal's CM Jornal.
"Since then, more than €319,000 has gone missing from one [bank] account and more than €200,000 from another," he alleged.
Last December, the three lodged two criminal cases of abuse of trust against Ms Monteiro and listed Mr Marcolino's assets. A psychological assessment was under way to see whether Mr Marcolino should be appointed a representative to manage his affairs.
But they say they were caught by surprise when they found out their father had married.
They say officials at a register office 80km (50 miles) away refused to marry the pair, forcing them to travel to another one 150km away.
Portuguese news agency Lusa has repeatedly contacted Ms Monteiro's lawyer, but her lawyer says she has "no questions to answer".

All article text:The TUC said its research showed top executives receive a year's worth of the minimum wage in just one day.
It said the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and called for "reality in boardrooms".
A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she had highlighted action was needed on executive pay.
The TUC research indicated the median pay award, discounting pensions, of a major FTSE 100 director soared by 47% in the five years to 2015, to Â£3.4m.
That compares with what the union body says was a 7% increase for average wages during the same time frame.
It took Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP, the UK's highest paid chief executive, less than 45 minutes to earn what an average worker receives in a year, the TUC added.
"We're seeing a growing disconnect between Britain's boardrooms and shop floors when it comes to pay," the TUC's Deputy General Secretary, Paul Nowak, told the BBC.
Speaking ahead of the TUC annual conference in Brighton he added:  "Over the last five years, Britain's bosses have seen their pay rise by nearly 50%.
"And at the same time, ordinary working people have seen real terms pay freezes, and we think that's unfair, it's not right, and it's not sustainable in the long term for the health of the economy."
Meanwhile, the TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady, called on the prime minister to "deliver on her promise to put workers on company boards".
She added: "This would inject a much-needed dose of reality into boardrooms and help put the brakes on the multimillion pay packages that have damaged the reputation of corporate Britain."
As well as promising to put workers on boards, Theresa May has proposed making shareholder votes on executive pay binding, rather than advisory.
The prime minister has also said she wants more transparency about bonus targets and for companies to reveal the ratio between chief executive pay and that of its average worker.
In a speech to the G20 group of major economic nations last week, she said: "To restore greater fairness, we will bring forward a consultation this autumn on measures to tackle corporate irresponsibility, cracking down on excessive corporate pay and poor corporate governance, and giving employees and customers representation on company boards."
Professor Andre Spicer, from the Cass Business School which is part of City, University of London, says some firms are already coming under pressure to curb high managers' pay.
He told the BBC: "We're beginning to see disquiet amongst investors at the moment so there's been pushback amongst big executive pay deals at places like Deutsche Bank, Burberry and a number of organisations.
"So investors are beginning to become fed up with this. It's likely that we're beginning to see questioning of this widespread practice, that CEOs need to be paid a lot to perform well."

News of his son's abduction was reported by Russian news website Life News, quoting its own sources.
The kidnappers are demanding 3m euros (Â£2.6m; $4.3m) for Ivan's safe return, the website says.
According to the unconfirmed report, he was snatched while on his way to work in Moscow on Tuesday.
When contacted by Russian newspaper Gazeta, Kaspersky Lab said it could neither confirm nor deny the report.
There has been no official comment on the story.
Kaspersky Lab is regarded outside Russia as one of the country's few business success stories not related to the energy sector.
The US business magazine Fast Company recently ranked Kaspersky Lab among the Top 50 Most Innovative Companies worldwide.

All article text:People who depend on being able to harvest forest resources should receive payment under the schemes.
But researchers say there is a "reality gap" between safeguards designed to help affected communities and who actually receives the compensation.
The findings have been published online in Global Environment Change.
"About 11% of global emissions come from deforestation and degradation of tropical forests so the idea is that if you can slow this down then that can offset emissions and that is good for climate mitigation," explained Julia Jones from Bangor University, Wales.
Over the past decade, schemes called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (Redd/Redd+) have been developed as part of the global effort to mitigate climate change.
These mechanisms are designed to improve forest management and reduce the net emission of greenhouse gases in tropical forest and sub-tropical forest nations.
"It finally got approval (at the UN climate summit) in Paris in December that Redd+ will go ahead as a global climate mitigation mechanism," Prof Jones told BBC News.
"What that means in reality is more protected areas and more funding. This sounds brilliant, after all it is a win-win situation and what is there not to like about it?"
However, it has been widely acknowledged that such schemes - if not implemented properly - can have a significant negative impact on people's livelihoods, such as indigenous communities, and exacerbate poverty.
"This has been taken on board by, for example, the World Bank," observed Prof Jones.
"They have made commitments that anything they fund [and] people are displaced as a result, they must be compensated for it.
"These commitments are also encapsulated in other doctrines, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity."
But she added: "The problem is how do you go about doing that? The way that the World Bank guidelines work is that households affected by a scheme must be identified and then compensated for the negative impact of the establishment of a protected area on their livelihoods."
In order to test whether the commitment to "social safeguards" were working on the ground, the team of UK and Madagascan researchers looked in detail at an area within Madagascar where a new protected area was being established.
The work was being funded by the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility.
"We have shown that, yes, they have gone out there and identified households that they think are affected negatively by conservation and have delivered compensation."
However, she added, the compensation was not reaching those most affected by the project.
"We have mapped every single household that should have been covered by the compensation and have shown thatâ€¦ the process had some very serious biases in it," she said.
"Essentially, the people that were identified were easier to reach physically - such as closer to the road or closer to the administrative centre.
"They also tended to be more socially connected; members of local forestry management committees, and they were - on average - richer or, at least, less poor."
Prof Jones said it was not what would be expected from a scheme that was delivering the help where it was needed most.
"People that are closer to the administrative centre are further away from the forest so they are less dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods," she suggested.
"What is interesting here is that the World Bank has very explicit guidelines that it has to be pro-poor and target vulnerable groups. We have shown that it is not working."
She said the study required researchers to spend a long time in the area in order to learn where all the households were located. In some cases, team members had to walk for eight or nine hours in order to reach some of the most remote communities.
"A criticism is that you can miss households like that if you come in for a short period of time but this is one of the problems;  you cannot expect consultants paid through a World Bank project to be putting in that level of effort to find individual households," she added.
"We do not want to be criticising the individual implementers of that particular project but we want to highlight a 'reality gap' between these lovely policies that sound great on paper and the reality on the ground which is that it is incredibly difficult to implement these policies."
Prof Jones said the study's aim was not to pass judgement on the projects nor the way the compensation scheme was implemented.
There is value pointing out that there is this reality gap," she added.
"In countries like Madagascar, there is such poor mapping so when you are planning something like this and you do not have a map that shows villages that have primary schools etc then you are not going to be allocating sufficient resources.
"I would say that whenever there is any sort of effort to implement a conservation scheme then there needs to be an effort to map the human population. Relying on very old and out-of-date maps is not sufficient."
The team suggested that providing compensation to all households in an affected area would prove to be more financially efficient, as the cost of providing the resources needed to map and assess households "may not be feasible".
