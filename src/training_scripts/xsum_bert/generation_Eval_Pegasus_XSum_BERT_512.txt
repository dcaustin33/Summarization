Article text: ???People are increasingly living in the wrong places, and it's likely that extreme events will be more common," Prof Mace says. The authors say cutting greenhouse gas emissions is essential. They suggest threats could be tackled through a dual approach. Other low-cost options are planting new trees, encouraging green roofs, or painting roofs white to reflect the sun. They say: ???Unless risks are accurately evaluated and reported, companies will have limited incentives to reduce them. And valuations and investment decisions will continue to be poorly informed.

Article text: The UK topped the table when the EIU last carried out this exercise in 2010. So for the UK to again lead the pack, including all other wealthy nations, is significant. The Health Ombudsman in England recently highlighted cases where people were badly let down and experienced death without dignity. So to score more highly than Australia and New Zealand, as well as Germany, France and the US is highly commendable. Affordability of care, with a taxpayer funded health service, is predictably a lot more bearable for British patients than in other economies.

Article text: A total of 106 episodes featuring the first two actors to play the Doctor, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton, are currently missing. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes. In 1991, all four instalments of the Patrick Troughton adventure The Tomb of the Cybermen were discovered in Hong Kong. A special episode featuring the current Doctor Matt Smith and his predecessor David Tennant will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November. Details of how fans will be able to watch the recovered episodes are also expected to be revealed later this week.

Article text: 2%, compared with British growth of 2. The first quarter saw the volume of sales in Scotland fall by 0. 5% between January and March. "Indeed, shop prices have fallen each month for the past four years which demonstrates that retailers are having to work ever harder to maintain let alone grow sales values. "
Euan Murray, from Barclays Corporate Banking, said: "Increased supply chain costs and issues could go some way to explaining the falling figures in this quarter - from the bad weather in Spain affecting food imports to the weak value of sterling, you don't have to look far for a reason. "
