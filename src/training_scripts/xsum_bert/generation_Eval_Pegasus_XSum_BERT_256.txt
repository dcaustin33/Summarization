All article text:Some who follow the subject closely argued that the Â£2.45bn deficit across health trusts in England in the last financial year was not as bad as it might have been.
But it was still a dramatic increase on the previous 12 months and it illustrates two major challenges for the government - one immediate and the other longer term.
Right now, the deficit at English hospital and other trusts, in other words the difference between the money they received and what they had to pay for patient care, is causing real headaches at the Department of Health.
Official accounts are being prepared for the financial year which ended in March and are set to be published in the summer.
If senior civil servants can't demonstrate that the DoH kept within the limit of around Â£116bn voted on by Parliament, there will be serious and unprecedented trouble in Whitehall.
A National Audit Office inquiry could follow, along with heavy political flak directed at the government.
Usually deficits among health trusts can be balanced by surpluses elsewhere in the system, for example in clinical commissioning groups. This time, officials have struggled to find the money in the system to balance the books.
A finance director at a hospital trust has told the BBC anonymously that unorthodox methods are being used to make the sums add up.
He alleged that the department was "cooking up accounting alchemy" to turn large hospital deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets its spending limit.
He claimed that transferring money from investment to day-to-day spending was being encouraged on a much wider scale than was normal.
The same finance director went on to say that consultancy firms had been sent into 20 trusts to assess whether their accounting assumptions were too cautious.
He claimed that their findings were being passed back to the Department of Health which would use them to adjust the overall deficit position downwards.
He said: "I am deeply worried that the findings of the 20 site visits are likely to be used to alter the NHS accounts."
The Department denied there was anything untoward going on, while acknowledging that parts of the NHS were under pressure.
A spokesman said: "The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading. Our financial statements will be audited by the independent National Audit Office."
Ministers also argue they have helped hospitals curb the increase in spending on agency staff.
Looking beyond the current scramble to balance the books, there is a longer term financial challenge for the NHS.
It is hard to see how the aggregate trust deficit can be reduced significantly this year. So a chunk of the extra money allocated by the chancellor for 2016-17 will be eaten up before a single extra patient is cared for.
The deficit reflects a fundamental mismatch between the funding flow to hospitals and what they need to find the right staff and provide appropriate care.
Ministers argue they have given NHS leaders all the extra money they asked for and that greater efficiency savings can be made. But health spending is not keeping pace with demand and, as a share of national income, is behind many other leading economies.
More than one health expert has pointed out that it is time for the nation to decide how much it wants to spend to deliver the healthcare citizens expect.

All article text:Bertie Acheson, who was 72, died after a confrontation with the intruder at his home in Glenmore Gardens, Coleraine, in April 2012.
Paul James Manolito Toland, originally of The Cedars, Antrim, had pleaded guilty to Mr Acheson's manslaughter.
After his release he must serve a further four and half years on licence.
Toland, a father of four, has 18 previous convictions for burglary.
He was confronted by his victim after he broke into the couple's home to steal money.
There was a struggle and Mr Acheson, who cared for his disabled wife Sheila, suffered a heart attack and died on his kitchen floor.
Speaking after the sentencing, the senior investigating officer in the case said the Acheson family had been left "devastated" by his loss, particularly his widow.
Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison said the fact that Toland was sentenced on what would have been Mr Acheson's 75th birthday had a "double impact" on the pensioner's loved ones.
"A person who I deem to be dangerous has now been taken off the streets and people can now feel safe in their homes," the officer said.
"Paul Toland was a predator. He preyed on the vulnerable and elderly and equally infirm couple who had been married for 44 years. His actions resulted in the death of Bertie Acheson, for just over Â£300."
An earlier court hearing was told that the couple were woken up by the sound of breaking glass in the early hours of 20 April 2012.
Mr Acheson went to investigate.  His widow later told police she overheard a verbal altercation between her husband and an intruder, during which money was demanded.
Mrs Acheson claimed she also heard the sound of a scuffle and gasping for breath. She managed to raise the alarm, but when ambulance personnel and police arrived at the scene, her husband was already dead.
Toland had originally been charged with Mr Acheson's murder, but at a court hearing in October, a defence lawyer asked that his client be re-arraigned. Toland told Belfast Crown Court that he was not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.
He also admitted the robbery of Mrs Acheson, who had Â£335 stolen from her purse during the burglary.
Det Ch Insp Harrison paid tribute to the courage and resilience of the pensioner's family throughout the "long and protracted inquiry".
The officer said that Toland had been in the couple's house the previous month to repair a vacuum cleaner and had been paid in cash.
"We believe that Toland's greed brought him back to the house in the expectation that he could break in and steal whatever cash he could get his hands on," Det Ch Insp Harrison added.
He appealed to the public not to store cash at home saying they were exposing themselves to "unnecessary risk".
"In memory of Bertie Acheson, and to avoid the pain still being suffered by his family, please do not keep large amounts of money at home," the officer said.

All article text:But their decision to take up rowing - and winning Olympic gold at their first attempt - has sealed their place in British sporting history.
Glover, 26, and Stanning, 27, took victory in the women's pair at Eton Dorney on Wednesday to win the first gold medal for Britain at London 2012.
More remarkably, they become the first British female rowers to achieve the feat since the sport was added to the Olympics in 1976.
Born in Truro, Glover was a cross-country runner and hockey player, competing internationally, before burying her head in books and gaining a teaching qualification.
It wasn't until she heard about Sporting Giants, a scheme to find the Olympians of the future, in 2008 that she stepped into a boat and picked up an oar for the first time. From there, she was chosen for the Great Britain's rowing talent programme, two years after Stanning joined the same initiative, and two years later the dream team was formed.
Stanning, who was born in Yeovil, took a different route, taking up rowing at 19 after her friends suggested she try it because she was tall. Two years later she was on the rowing talent programme but switched her focus to the army, where she was commissioned in 2008.
Four years ago, she decided to focus on rowing, taking a break from the Royal Artillery, and heading back to the water. There she teamed up with Glover and started on the road to London.
The pair narrowly missed out on gold to New Zealand at last year's World Championships, but that defeat was their last as they upped the stroke rate in 2012 to remain unbeaten in all three World Cups.
They were barely mentioned in the build-up to London as three-time Olympic silver medallist Katherine Grainger and her chase for that elusive gold dominated the headlines along with the men's four - Britain's flagship boat - which has won gold in the last three Olympics.
But an Olympic record in the first race of the regatta sparked interest - and their performance in the final in front of a partisan home crowd - was the perfect way to end what could be their last race together.
Before the regatta, Stanning said she would return to the army, with a posting in Afghanistan a possibility. Regardless of whether she sticks to her decision or decides to add to her medal collection, their achievement will forever be engraved on London 2012 - because everyone remembers the first.

All article text:Speaking at London's Science Museum the scientist also says he believes the future of humanity depends on living on other planets.
"The long-term future of the human race must be space and that it represents an important life insurance for our future survival," he says.
"It could prevent the disappearance of humanity by the colonisation of other planets."
Professor Hawking made the comments while escorting an American visitor around the museum as part of a guest of honour prize.
"Sending humans to the moon changed the future of the human race in ways that we don't yet understand," he went on.
"It hasn't solved any of our immediate problems on planet Earth, but it has given us new perspectives on them and caused us to look both outward and inward."
Adaeze Uyanwah, 24 and from California, won the tour after producing a blog and video describing a "perfect day" in London.
She asked Prof Hawking what human failings he would alter.
"The human failing I would most like to correct is aggression," he says.
"It may have had survival advantage in caveman days, to get more food, territory, or partner with whom to reproduce, but now it threatens to destroy us all.
"A major nuclear war would be the end of civilization, and maybe the end of the human race."
The scientist then got a bit spiritual when he told her: "The quality I would most like to magnify is empathy. It brings us together in a peaceful, loving state."
Ms Uyanwah says she was blown away by the meeting.
"It's incredible to think when my grandchildren are learning Stephen Hawking's theories in science class, I'll be able to tell them I had a personal meeting with him.
"It's something I'll never forget."

All article text:On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron said Crewe could lose HS2 investment in a post-election Labour-SNP deal.
But SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie described the comments as "utterly meaningless" and "preposterous".
Crewe's Labour candidate Adrian Heald said he would "not support any move to jeopardise the HS2 line at Crewe".
A report last year into the route of the high-speed rail line running north from London recommended a new station be built in Crewe.
But Mr Cameron said a minority Labour government, backed by the SNP, means schemes could be dropped.
The prime minister said projects linked to HS2 that could be jettisoned include Crewe's planned University Technical College and the Railway Exchange Training Academy.
Also speaking on Monday, Chancellor George Osborne said: "The SNP deputy leader has said in the last couple of days, if there was a minority Labour administration that needed SNP help to get their legislation through 'we might well say let's not have HS2 go to Manchester and Birmingham, let's have it start in Edinburgh and Glasgow'.
"That is tearing up the plan for huge investment in Crewe. That is cancelling the thousands of jobs and businesses that will come to this town.
"That is a billion pound blow to Crewe and is the price tag of voting for Labour and Ed Miliband here."
While Labour has ruled out a coalition with the SNP, Scottish nationalists for their part have said they could support a minority Labour government on an "issue-by-issue" basis.
Echoing the SNP's manifesto, Mr Hosie said he would like to see a Scottish section of HS2 built "at the same time" as the first phase planned between London and the West Midlands, allowing the line to "meet in the middle" of the country.
"Why would that put investment in Crewe at risk?" he said.
"What would put Crewe investment at risk is the Â£30bn cuts presented by Cameron and friends."
Meanwhile, Labour candidate Mr Heald said: "HS2 is the best opportunity to generate prosperity in Crewe and South Cheshire."
He said Labour is "fully supportive" of the HS2 line.
Crewe and Nantwich in Cheshire is a marginal Conservative constituency.
Roy Wood, Liberal Democrat candidate, confirmed his party were "strong supporters of HS2 even when other parties were wavering" and that David Cameron's comments were "scaremongering from someone who is getting desperate."
UKIP is the only party standing in Crewe and Nantwich to reject plans for HS2.
Richard Lee, the party's candidate, said UKIP believed the line was "an unaffordable white elephant" and that money could be better spent on upgrading the local and regional rail network.
"The benefits to Crewe, if any, will not be felt in Crewe for a number of years anyway, and it sounds as though David Cameron is merely scaremongering," he said.
"UKIP are fully committed to technical colleges and practical apprenticeship training in schools regardless of HS2."

"We think they have been a good addition to the Championship since they have entered.
"They have improved dramatically but other teams have improved dramatically - it's a relative thing.
"It's not that long ago they beat South Africa in the autumn series so they are capable of beating anyone on their day and worthy participants.
"We are very happy with how the Italians are approaching things.
"There is a long way to go in terms of being competitive to win the title. But on any given day they can beat any of the sides and they have done that, apart from England."
The Six Nations have also employed bonus points for the first time although a side who wins the Grand Slam are guaranteed to win the tournament.
"It is something we have considered for many years but resisted to date," said Feehan.
"If you look at the Six Nations, it is inherently unfair because some teams have three home games and other teams have two home matches in any given year and there is an imbalance.
"That word balance is key and we are looking to see whether the benefits we get on encouraging more tries to be scored is better than any direct imbalance.
"We decided we had to give it a try to see if it works.
"If you look at the the championship two years ago, we ended up with 27 tries on the last day.
"Teams can score tries when they wish to and need to.

All article text:Jennah Bawa, eight, had been on a shopping trip with her Kenyan-born mother, Zahira, on Saturday.
Businessman Louis Bawa, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, said he had spoken to them on Friday but "didn't get a chance to catch up with them" again.
"This time they didn't come home."
The official death toll stands at 62, with more than 170 injured.
The UK government says five of the dead people have been confirmed as British, with another one thought to be British.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office said it was aware of comments by Kenya's foreign minister that a British woman was among foreign nationals involved in the attack.
Amina Mohamed said the Briton was a woman who has "done this many times before" and two or three Americans were also among the suspected militants.
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "We continue to liaise very closely with the Kenyan authorities and to support their investigation into this attack."
Kenyan security forces say they have now taken control of all floors of the shopping centre in Nairobi, although an explosion and gunfire was heard from there on Tuesday morning.
The Somali Islamist movement al-Shabab says it carried out the attack at the Westgate shopping mall in retaliation for Kenyan military operations in Somalia.
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Bawa, 43, said his wife and daughter were both Muslims but were killed by "animals" who were using "religion as an excuse to kill people... They're saying that they were targeting certain people, but they were targeting anyone".
The family lived in Leamington Spa until last year, when lawyer Mrs Bawa is reported to have returned to Kenya to look after her mother. Mr Bawa then took a job as the chief executive of a marketing company in Dubai and began commuting to his family in Nairobi at weekends.
He told the paper: "The last time I spoke to them was on Friday evening, I didn't get a chance to catch up with them on Saturday morning. They were going to Westgate to do what they always did, grocery shopping. This time they didn't come home.
"I think our last conversation was about just normal things, school fees, something like that, I can't remember. I don't know exactly what happened but it looks to me that they were gunned down ... they were just shot."
Mr Bawa began waiting outside the mall on Sunday for news of his family.
Describing the moment he realised they were among the victims, Mr Bawa said: "At first I was convinced that they would be OK. I had hope. Then on Sunday night there was a team that went in to bring out some bodies and they took photographs of other bodies.
"We all had to look at these pictures - something I would never want anyone to have to do - and identify them. That was how I knew. My heart just stopped, that was the last news in the world I wanted to hear. It's like nothing else, I can't fathom it, even now."
He added that last week he had promised Jennah that he would buy her any "present in the world" if she did well in her exams.
Mr Bawa said: "She said she wanted a pony, a particular coloured pony but she said she thought even though her exams were not until December, she better tell me now so I could start saving up because she was going to work very hard."
Architect Ross Langdon, who had British-Australian citizenship, has also been named as one of the UK victims although the Foreign Office is still not confirming identities.
Mr Langdon's company, Regional Associates, issued a tribute to him and said he had died alongside his pregnant partner, Elif Yavuz, a Dutch citizen.
Another of those killed was a Peruvian public health consultant who had been set to take up a full-time post at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
Dr Juan Jesus Ortiz-Iruri, 63, was due to arrive at its Centre for Maternal and Newborn Health this week.
After a meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra on Monday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the UK had been in contact with the Kenyan authorities throughout and with its own diplomatic representation in Nairobi.
Meanwhile, speaking at the United Nations in New York,  Foreign Secretary William Hague said the attacks were "not going to deter us or the people of Kenya from our continuing work in Somalia".
Al-Shabab, which is part of the al-Qaeda network, has repeatedly threatened attacks on Kenyan soil if Nairobi did not pull its troops out of Somalia.
There are about 4,000 Kenyan troops in the south of Somalia, where they have been fighting the militants since 2011.

All article text:A letter has been signed by more than 150 groups before a European Parliament vote on ways to limit their sale.
Many tech gadgets such as smartphones use conflict materials, so-called because they are mined in warlike conditions and traded by armed groups.
The letter says the law must cover more manufacturers and types of materials, and make firms police supply chains.
European politicians will vote on proposals drawn up by the European Commission on 19 May.
Signed by Amnesty International. Friends of the Earth, Global Witness, Christian Aid, the Ethical Consumer Research Association and many others, the open letter says the trade in conflict minerals fuels wars and human rights abuses around the world.
It says the vote this week is a "landmark opportunity" for Europe to take action to stem the trade and curtail the conflict it engenders.
However, it says the current proposals are "weak" and do not go far enough.
The big problem with the scheme proposed by Brussels is that it applies on a voluntary basis to most companies, the groups argue. As a result, they say, few firms would be motivated to clean up their supply chains and report on their actions.
In addition, the letter says, the scheme only covers four minerals - tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold - in their raw form, and does nothing to address products entering Europe which have been made using conflict minerals. Many smartphones, tablets and other devices made in China are manufactured using these substances.
The letter says the scheme does not cover minerals and materials such as diamonds, jade and chromite, which are also known to be sources of conflict.
It urges MEPs to reject the plans in favour of a stronger scheme involving a mandatory system to ensure firms vet their supply chain.
"Those bearing the cost of our weak efforts to regulate this trade will be some of the poorest and most vulnerable citizens of the world," said the letter. "Now is the time for change."
Romanian MEP Iuliu Winkler - the European Parliament's lead negotiator on the plans - has previously said he "largely supported" the plans, adding that the priority should be ensuring that the right incentives are in place to encourage participation.
However, Green and left-wing MEPs have criticised the opt-in nature of the scheme.

All article text:The statement, purportedly sent by a British member of IS, said it was "outrageous" to suggest the Mannan family from Luton had been kidnapped and forced to join the group.
The BBC has not been able to verify if the statement is genuine.
A friend of a teenager among the 12 said he thought he had been "tricked".
The family, who have not been seen since 17 May, includes three children aged between one and 11. Police have previously said they may have travelled to Syria.
The statement is accompanied by two photos purportedly of family member Muhammed Abdul Mannan, which have not been independently verified.
It comes as a video apparently released by the IS group showed 25 men being shot dead in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra.
The missing family is:
The statement, passed to the BBC by a Briton fighting with IS, said the family had arrived in a land that was "free from corruption and oppression" and had not been "commanded" to join by a single person but by the "Khalifah of the Muslims".
It said: "We say to those that are concerned for our safety to put your hearts at rest for we feel safer than we have ever felt before."
It went on to urge Muslims to "race to your state".
Nazrull Ali, a school friend of 19-year-old Mohammed Toufique Hussain, who is said to be among the 12, said he did not believe the statement.
"That doesn't seem right to be honest. I don't think they would say stuff like that," he said.
"I don't know but I heard they [IS] could make you say whatever they want, obviously if someone puts a gun to your head what would you say?" he said.
"He would have said bye to all of us properly and I'm telling you, he did not know that he was going to Syria. I know it wasn't him, I think he's got tricked into it. It wasn't his idea, definitely."
The Islamic State group has seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria since last June, becoming notorious for its brutality, including mass killings, abductions and beheadings.
On 29 June 2014 it announced the formation of a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth, or caliph.
Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London, which tracks the movements of foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq, said there was an element of propaganda to the statement.
Mr Maher said he was told by a British fighter that the family had chosen to release the statement to show it was their decision to move.
He said the broader project of IS was to persuade women and families to join them.
"They never wanted just fighters, I think that's a misnomer," he said.
The family was reported missing to police by two sons, understood to be Mr Mannan's from a previous marriage, who live in Luton.
They flew to Bangladesh on 10 April, police said, and then to Istanbul on 11 May.
They were due back at Heathrow three days later but failed to return.
It is believed Ms Khanom had links to banned Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, which had members in Luton.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that two sisters from another Luton family were prevented from flying to Bangladesh by counter-terror police shortly before the family of 12 went missing.
Officers seized the passport of one of the sisters, who is in her 20s and is said to be linked to the banned radical group Al-Muhajiroun.
They allowed the second sister to fly out to Bangladesh to join her family two or three days after the stop, between late March and early April.
Separately, two of three east London teenagers who fled to Syria to join IS have married militants, a lawyer for their relatives said on Saturday.
Bethnal Green Academy pupils, Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Amira Abase, 15, fled Britain in February to join the militant group.
Hundreds of Britons have travelled to support or fight for jihadist organisations in Syria or Iraq. Last month three sisters reportedly took their nine children to Syria.

All article text:The city's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty lay a wreath at Dalbeth Cemetery in honour of five Glasgow Auxiliary Fire Service messenger boys.
They died at the height of the German bombing on 13 and 14 March 1941.
The boys were among 90 youngsters who cycled or ran with potentially lifesaving messages for front-line fire crews during the war.
The lord provost laid the wreath in honour of all the messenger boys who died at a Celtic Cross which was erected at the grave of 15-year-old Neil Leitch.
He died from bomb injuries sustained while trying to take a communication to Partick Fire Station.
The teenager had been injured during an earlier mission when he was blown off his bicycle by a bomb.
He defied orders to rest and continued with his duties until he was fatally injured.
The lord provost said: "I am proud to join others to remember the remarkable, and little known, bravery of Neil Leitch and all the other Fire Service volunteer boy cyclists across the country, who put their lives on the line to save others during the Second World War.
"Sadly Neil Leitch along with four others paid the ultimate price that terrible night as our city and its citizens were relentlessly bombed."
Following his death, Neil Leitch was gazetted by King George VI for his bravery and devotion to duty.
His nephew James Leitch, a former Clydebank fireman who now lives in Orkney, attended the service along with family from across the UK.
James said: "I grew up hearing about my uncle Neil and this is something we have always wanted to do.
"These boys were forgotten. To me they deserve recognition. It will be an emotional day."
The lord provost was joined by George McGrandles, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the city's senior fire officer.
He formed part of a Fire and Rescue Service Guard of Honour in tribute to the youngsters.
"The role of the boy messengers isn't widely known but it was absolutely vital," he said.
"They took on an incredibly dangerous role to ensure fire crews could get to where they were needed even when bombs destroyed communications channels.
"It took incredible courage and, in trying to save others, these five youngsters ultimately lost their lives."

All article text:A US law prevents the government from selling arms to countries which fail to tackle human rights abuses.
Mr Buhari met President Barack Obama in Washington on Monday to seek further assistance.
Boko Haram has killed some 10,000 people since 2009 and has also kidnapped hundreds of girls and women.
Last month, human rights group Amnesty International said that some 8,000 men and boys had died in Nigerian military custody after being detained as suspected militants.
The military rejected this allegation, Nigeria's president promised an investigation but there have been no further details.
The US has previously promised some $5m (Â£3.2m) in military assistance to the regional coalition helping to fight Boko Haram, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
However, Mr Buhari heavily criticised the US, especially the Leahy Law, which links military sales to human rights.
The Nigerian military did "not possess the appropriate weapons and technology which we could have had if the so-called human rights violations had not been an obstacle," he told the United States Institute of Peace on Wednesday.
"Unwittingly, and I dare say unintentionally, the application of the Leahy Law Amendment by the United States government has aided and abetted the Boko Haram terrorists."
In the latest suspected Boko Haram attack, at least 29 people were killed in bomb blasts at two bus stations in the north-eastern city of Gombe on Wednesday.
At least 11 people were earlier killed in the Cameroonian town of Maroua, just over the border from Gombe.
Boko Haram last year seized a huge area of north-eastern Nigeria, before being beaten back by a regional coalition, including Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
Mr Buhari was elected in March, partly on a pledge to defeat Boko Haram.

It follows weeks of speculation that some lost episodes had been located.
A total of 106 episodes featuring the first two actors to play the Doctor, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton, are currently missing.
The BBC destroyed many of the sci-fi drama's original transmission tapes in the 1960s and 1970s.
However, the majority of the episodes had been transferred on to film for foreign broadcasters. It is often these prints found in other countries that are the source of retrieved episodes.
In 1991, all four instalments of the Patrick Troughton adventure The Tomb of the Cybermen were discovered in Hong Kong.
The latest find comes as Doctor Who celebrates its 50th birthday. A special episode featuring the current Doctor Matt Smith and his predecessor David Tennant will be shown on the programme's anniversary on 23 November.
A raft of other programming to celebrate the long-running drama was also recently announced by the BBC.
Details of how fans will be able to watch the recovered episodes are also expected to be revealed later this week.
