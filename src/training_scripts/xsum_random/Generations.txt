Article text: Illegal immigrants are being smuggled out of Britain to avoid deportation – before being sneaked back in after gaining immigration status elsewhere in Europe. Using the ‘asylum loophole’, people smugglers charge £1,000 per person to arrange trips to Europe, allowing illegal immigrants to gain legitimate paperwork. It means that if they are caught trying to return to Britain, they are not sent back to their birth country but to the European state that gave them their first asylum-seeking status. Illegal cargo: The migrants in the Romanian lorry which they boarded in Kent before it headed for Calais via Dover . The lorry was never searched and was said to have breezed through immigration controls in Britain and France . The lorry driver was confronted by reporters from BBC's South East Today programme . The ruse was exposed by the BBC’s South East Today programme which was broadcast last night. Reporters contacted a gang of people smugglers – using a fixer called Ajmal – who agreed to take him out of the country and bring him back for £1,000. Hidden cameras showed Ajmal getting on to a Romanian-based lorry in Kent before it headed for Calais via a Dover ferry. The truck was never searched and was said to have ‘breezed’ through immigration controls in Britain and France. Only hours later, Ajmal was released in Belgium along with 20 other illegal immigrants from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The report told how many of the illegal immigrants – and some who had outstayed their student visas – were told to make their way to Italy to apply for asylum. Once there they are fingerprinted and are able to gain immigration status, allowing them to lengthen their stay in Europe. If they are caught trying to return to Britain, they only face being returned to Italy or other European countries rather than their countries of origin. Many illegal immigrants were told to make their way to Italy to apply for asylum . John Vine, the former Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said: ‘I don’t think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the UK to other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world' Less than two years ago, border officials spoke of their shock of people trying to smuggle themselves out of the UK . Asked how he would return to Britain, Ajmal said: ‘When I want to go to the UK … he say “ring my same number and I will tell you what to do and where you need to come – I will take you back to the UK”.’ Last night John Vine, the former Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said: ‘I don’t think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the UK to other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is an issue the authorities need to look at very seriously.’ In 2006, Italy announced it would grant citizenship to immigrants who had stayed in the country for five years. However, it emerged that from January to August last year, 140,000 illegal immigrants had entered Europe via Italy. The eight-month figure was more than the entire total for the previous year. Less than two years ago, border officials in the UK told of their ‘shock’ at the ‘very unusual’ case of 28 illegal immigrants trying to smuggle themselves out of Britain. The immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka hid on a Polish lorry on a P&O ferry bound for France. They were returned to Dover to be questioned at the Border Force immigration centre.

Article text: It weighs just half an ounce and its natural home is a tree. But tiny songbird the blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes non-stop flights of up to 1,700 miles across open ocean, scientists have confirmed. The heroic journeys are 'on the brink of impossibility', according to one of the researchers who attached tracking devices to 40 birds. Long journey: The blackpoll warbler routinely undertakes flights of up to 1,700 miles, flying without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic . Experts had long wondered about tantalising clues that suggested the warbler was capable of epic migrations between North and South America. Now they have proof that it really does fly without stopping to rest, eat or drink across the Atlantic. Unlike other migratory songbirds travelling south for the winter, the warbler ignores the safe option of hugging the coastline through Mexico and Central America. Instead it risks death by flying hundreds of miles from land even though it cannot land on water and live. Nice flight: A blackpoll warbler wearing a miniature tracking device . US scientists were astonished when they analysed data from some of the birds they tracked from New England and Canada to the Caribbean, Venezuela and Colombia. Dr Bill DeLuca, from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said: 'It was pretty thrilling to get the return birds back, because their migratory feat in itself is on the brink of impossibility. 'When we accessed the locators, we saw the blackpolls' journey was indeed directly over the Atlantic. The distances travelled ranged from 1,410 to 1,721 miles.' He added: 'For small songbirds, we are only just now beginning to understand the migratory routes that connect temperate breeding grounds to tropical wintering areas. 'We're really excited to report that this is one of the longest non-stop over-water flights ever recorded for a songbird, and finally confirms what has long been believed to be one of the most extraordinary migratory feats on the planet.' For the study, published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, the scientists captured 20 birds in Vermont and another 20 in Nova Scotia and fitted them with geolocator packs. The devices, each about the size of a 5p piece, were attached using leg harnesses, much like a rucksack. Too small to house GPS receivers, they operated by means of 'solar geolocation' - a method used for centuries by mariners and explorers. It is based on the fact that day length varies with latitude and the time of solar noon - when the sun is at its highest point in the sky - varies with longitude.

Article text: (CNN)Singer-songwriter David Crosby hit a jogger with his car Sunday evening, a spokesman said. The accident happened in Santa Ynez, California, near where Crosby lives. Crosby was driving at approximately 50 mph when he struck the jogger, according to California Highway Patrol Spokesman Don Clotworthy. The posted speed limit was 55. The jogger suffered multiple fractures, and was airlifted to a hospital in Santa Barbara, Clotworthy said. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening. "Mr. Crosby was cooperative with authorities and he was not impaired or intoxicated in any way. Mr. Crosby did not see the jogger because of the sun," said Clotworthy. According to the spokesman, the jogger and Crosby were on the same side of the road. Pedestrians are supposed to be on the left side of the road walking toward traffic, Clotworthy said. Joggers are considered pedestrians. Crosby is known for weaving multilayered harmonies over sweet melodies. He belongs to the celebrated rock group Crosby, Stills & Nash. "David Crosby is obviously very upset that he accidentally hit anyone. And, based off of initial reports, he is relieved that the injuries to the gentleman were not life threatening," said Michael Jensen, a Crosby spokesman. "He wishes the jogger a very speedy recovery."

Article text: Facebook has removed the personal account of a 12-year-old Georgia boy who posted a viral video last week in support of Rudy Giuliani's comments that President Obama 'doesn't love America'. Republican C.J.Pearson found out the price of his new found fame on Friday morning when a friend told him it had been deactivated for 'suspicious activity'. Fearing his video, which was watched by more than 1.4 million people, may have been the cause, Pearson hit out at the social media giant, accusing them of quelling any dissent towards Obama. Dumped: C. J. Pearson (seen here in a picture from his public page on Facebook) had his personal page deactivated after the social media giant became aware of his age . The first sign that something had gone awry came on Friday morning when Pearson informed his followers on his public page he had lost his personal account. 'I am having my Editor, Alan Davidson post on my behalf on this page while Facebook continues to lock me out,' wrote the Columbia Middle School student according to Fox. 'The 1st amendment is obviously not a big concern to the powers that be at Facebook, but we will continue to fight back!' Demanding a response from Facebook, they duly replied and gave him a cast-iron reason why they banned his page - he is 12. Indeed, it is explicitly stated in Facebook's terms and conditions that no one under the age of 13 can have an account. Drawing attention to yourself: CJ Pearson, a 12-year-old from Georgia, posted a viral video backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments criticizing President Obama's love for America . In a statement, Facebook said they were alerted to the fact that Pearson is 12 by a member of the public and acted accordingly. 'You have to be 13 to have a Facebook account. This is a requirement, not a suggestion. He was locked out because he lied about his age, not because of the content,' replied a Facebook representative. Pearson however, is not having that. 'I would consider that complete malarkey,' said Pearson to Fox DC. 'Because in all honesty, there are many many people younger than me who have a Facebook account.' 'I will not stop here,' he added to FOX 5. 'You cannot silence a voice that deserves to be heard. And I will continue to make as many accounts as possible.' Pearson made a number of media appearances over the weekend to draw attention to his plight. 'Time and time again, Facebook has shut down many conservative accounts after they decide to speak up,' Pearson said on Fox & Friends Sunday. Defense: Giuliani wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he didn't want to question Obama's motives or heart . Attacked: Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that President Barack Obama did not love his country like a commander in chief should . 'When a person decides to speak up, their voice shouldn’t be hindered because of someone disagreeing.' Last week, Giuliani may have come under fire for saying that President Barack Obama does not love America at a fundraising dinner for Governor Scott Walker, but he found a backer in Pearson. He told guests at the event - designed to raise cash for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker - that 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.' Democrats, the White House, and even members of the GOP have condemned his comments and heaped scorn on the retired politician, who was a Presidential contender in 2008. After the tide of criticism, middle school student CJ Pearson made a YouTube video agreeing with Giuliani, in which he said that the commander in chief had a 'downright hate for the American values our country holds'. The video, posted last Saturday on his channel, has garnered more than 1.4m views as of Monday night. A 'public figure' page for the student says he has 'considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8, supporting John McCain in his 2008 Presidential Campaign'. He said in his video that if Obama really loved America he would call Islamic State 'what it really is, an assault on Christianity' The student added that the president, who has ordered airstrikes on ISIS and asked for approval to send limited ground troops, was 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'. For his part, Giuliani has said that he stands by his controversial comments made last month. However, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he 'didn’t intend to question President Obama’s motives or the content of his heart'.

Article text: Scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a ‘game-changer’ in the battle against the disease. They have worked out how to teach the body’s immune system to identify cancer cells, allowing patients to be primed to destroy cancer. In one case an American woman given just weeks to live was cleared of advanced blood cancer. She is still alive three years later, and her doctor says she is not a one-off. Scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a ‘game-changer’ in the battle against the disease . British researchers are now working on a related approach. Both methods involve taking T-cells, which fight infection, and giving them the ability to recognise a special tag on the surface of cancer cells, called the WT1 protein. The research is being carried out on patients with leukaemia. But the scientists hope their vaccines will eventually be used to fight many types of cancer, including that of breast, bowel and prostate – whose cells tend to have WT1 on their surfaces. There is even talk of a ‘universal cancer vaccine’ among some scientists, although the researchers themselves believe that is unlikely. The treatments aim to help the immune system seek out and destroy cancer cells . They do this by giving T-cells the ability to detect a key marker called WT1 . Search and destroy: T-cells can be taught to identify and then kill cancer cells . WT1 is a protein found on the surface of the cells of many types of cancer . T-cells are a type of white blood cell, which fight infections or threats . An infusion of donor stem cells – which can transform into T-cells – may also be used to boost the immune system . Over the past three years, specialist Guenther Koehne, of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, has treated 15 plasma cell leukaemia patients with T-cells taught to recognise cancer. The disease can be treated with chemotherapy-like drugs but it tends to keep returning. All 15 were expected to die within months given normal treatment. But following his regime, Dr Koehne revealed ‘about half’ were still alive. He said: ‘I strongly feel this is a game-changer. Before treatment, I talked to these patients and they said to me: “I have no choice, let’s try this.” They had extremely limited life expectancy. A year later, they call me from work and say they are too busy to see me. That’s really happening.’ His treatment involves taking bone marrow from a donor and splitting it into stem cells and T-cells. The patient receives the stem cells straight away but the T-cells are sensitised to WT1 in the lab by exposing them to fragments of the protein. The T-cells are then given to the patient in a series of injections over several months. Dr Koehne’s first patient, graphic designer Ruth Lacey, 64, underwent the procedure in 2012 after being so ill following a relapse and intensive chemotherapy that she was ‘comatose’. But after receiving the stem cells and four T-cell doses, her cancer was reduced to undetectable levels. Dr Koehne said that seeing her ‘in good health and in complete remission’ was ‘clearly an extraordinary experience’. In the British study, led by Dr Emma Morris – a haematologist at University College London and the Royal Free Hospital, T-cells from up to 20 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or chronic myeloid leukaemia are to be extracted, inserted with DNA so they recognise WT1, and then put back again. ‘Most people have immune cells which can’t recognise cancer cells, which is one of the major problems with tackling the disease,’ Dr Morris explained. ‘We have genetically engineered patients’ immune cells so they develop receptors for the WT1 protein, making them much better at recognising leukaemia cells.’ One patient has already received an infusion containing genetically engineered’ T-cells and there are others whose cells are being prepared. The DNA is transferred into the T-cells using a ‘dummy’ virus that does not cause an infection. These then provide the blueprint to build the WT1 receptor. Three years ago, Ruth Lacey, was on death’s door having relapsed with an aggressive version of myeloma, a form of blood cancer. She was put in touch with Dr Guenther Koehne at New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who suggested the vaccine. First, she was given stem cells from her brother Walter’s bone marrow. Next, his T-cells were exposed to WT1 protein. Finally, she received the cells in a series of injections. At first, recovery was slow. But within two months she began to feel ‘consistently better’ and was allowed home. Ruth Lacey was on death's door with a form of blood cancer when a doctor suggested the vaccine . Book designer Mrs Lacey, 64, from Newburyport, Massachusetts, said the treatment meant she was well enough to garden, walk her dog, and go canoeing. Last summer she did relapse, but she is in remission again thanks to a new drug. Dr Koehne is also considering another T-cell injection. Ms Lacey said: ‘It’s a wonder, a miracle that I’m still here.’ In the short term, doctors are looking to see if these super-immune cells will be powerful enough to stop leukaemia patients from relapsing after chemotherapy. But scientists also hope this approach might work to help treat a range of other cancers too. Dr Morris, whose research with Professor Hans Stauss has been funded by the charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and government body Cell Therapy Catapult, said: ‘We could potentially use it in ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and patients with prostate or colon cancer too.’ She said the approach should produce less side effects than chemotherapy and provide longer-term protection than drugs, which are flushed out of the body in days or weeks, because immune cells have a ‘memory’, persisting at low levels in case a threat re-emerges. The hope is that the genetically engineered T-cells will do this with cancer, said Dr Morris, ‘multiplying again if needed – like an army ready to be reactivated’. However, Dr Kat Arney of Cancer Research UK, struck a note of caution: ‘These treatments are still in the early stages of clinical trials, and although some people have had great responses, they haven’t worked for everyone.’

Article text: Medical student Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir (above), who has travelled to Syria to treat Jihadi fighters, once praised the Charlie Hebdo murders . A British medical student who travelled to Syria to treat Jihadi fighters in Islamic State hospitals once praised the Charlie Hebdo murders, it emerged last night. Private schoolgirl Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir sent a smiling selfie to her sister as she crossed the border from Turkey on March 13 to reach Islamic State territory. The respected surgeon’s daughter is one of nine British doctors and students in their late teens or early 20s who are now believed to be volunteering in hospitals there. Their families have all flocked to the border in a desperate attempt to bring their children home, saying that they had been ‘cheated, brainwashed’ by IS militants. Yesterday, their parents issued a joint statement claiming that their children had travelled to the border to take part in ‘humanitarian’ work and had ‘excellent moral capabilities’. But posts on what is believed to be Miss Abdelgadir’s Twitter account suggest that her views are less than moral and that she has indeed gone to work with IS. She once retweeted: ‘The pictures that the 2 journalists produced on Islam and prophet Muhammed (saw) was more horrific then their killing.’ On the account, @Lenaalinglingg, she also called for Sharia law, retweeted a statement that homosexuality is a disease and criticised terror arrests, calling them ‘silly’. The private schoolgirl condemned Muslims who joined the ‘not in my name’ campaign which rejects IS and Muslims who wore poppy headscarves to mark Remembrance Day. She also once retweeted: ‘Fighting is not violence. Violence is tyranny, oppression, suppression & injustice. Only thru FIGHTING can we get OUT of VIOLENCE. #peace.’ Yesterday, it emerged that she is an ‘incredibly bright’ schoolgirl who attended Wisbech Grammar School in Cambridgeshire where fees are £12,000 a year. The students’ parents believe that they have gone to Turkey to offer ‘voluntary medical help’ to Syrian refugees on the border. They did, however, acknowledge that their children were missing and, when asked whether they thought their children might have joined IS, one father replied ‘we don’t know’. ‘Our sons and daughters have always been participating in humanitarian and good cause social work,’ the statement from the families said. ‘They have come to Turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on Turkey’s borders.’ The nine medics have been named as Mohammed Wael Fadlallah, Tasneem Suliman, Ismail Hamdoun, Nada Sami Kader, Mohammed Elbadri Ibrahim, Rawan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Tamir Ahmed Abusibah, Lena Mamoun Abdelgadir and Sami Ahmed Kadir. Nine British medical students have travelled to Syria to work in hospitals in Islamic State-held areas. Pictured from left to right: Hisham Mohammed Fadlallah, Lena Maumoon Abdulqadir and Tamer Ahmed Ebu Sebah . The four women and five men apparently kept their plans secret from their families and fled to Syria from a medical base in Sudan. Left to right: Rowan Kamal Zine El Abidine, Sami Ahmed Kadir and Ismail Hamadoun . The medical students are believed to now be in the ISIS-held area of Tel Abyad, according to a Turkish politician. From left to right: Nada Sami Kader, Mohamed Osama Badri Mohammed and Tasneem Suleyman . Yesterday, Chris Staley, head of Wisbech Grammar in Cambridgeshire, said Miss Abdelgadir, was ‘furiously bright’, ‘very normal’ and a ‘very focused young lady’. He described her as a popular, typical pupil who had represented the school in sports including hockey, had got 7 A*s and was a member of the student council. ‘She was an incredibly bright and focused young lady who was clearly destined for great things on the medical or scientific side,’ he said. The pupil, from King’s Lynn in Norfolk, spent nine years she spent at the Cambridgeshire school before studying medicine at Khartoum’s private University of Medical Sciences and Technology. Her parents sent her to Sudan to study so that she could reconnect with her Islamic roots. Instead, however, they fear she has been radicalised. On March 12, just before she crossed the border, she sent a smiling photo and the message: ‘Don’t worry, we’ve reached Turkey and are on our way to volunteer helping wounded Syrian people.’ Schoolgirls Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and  Amira Abase, 15, (pictured at Gatwick airport) fled to Turkey before crossing the border into Syria where they are believed to have become ISIS jihadi brides . Her father, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, where the family live, immediately flew to Turkey to find her. He previously said: ‘We have decided not to return home unless we go with them. We sent out children to study [in Sudan] so that they would be surrounded by their culture. ‘But their decision to go to Syria has been a shock for all of us.’ Mehmet Ali Ediboglu, a Turkish opposition politician helping the families, said the medics were believed to be in Tel Abyad, which is under IS control. He told The Observer: ‘The conflict out there is fierce, so medical help must be needed. They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think.’ A spokeswoman for Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘Our thoughts are with Mr Abdel-Gadir and his family at this difficult time.’ The Foreign Office said it was giving consular assistance to the families of seven Britons.

Article text: Scott Disick has checked into a luxury rehab center in Costa Rica. The reality star was pictured jetting off via helicopter to start his stay at the Rythmia Life Advancement Center on Monday. In a statement released via the center, he explained: 'I realise my issues are bigger than me and I'm ready to truly remedy this struggle I continue to battle.' It later emerged that Scott first visited the center back in February, but kept that spell in treatment confidential. Off to rehab: Scott Disick, second right, poses in front of a helicopter escorting him to the Rythmia Life Advancement Center; he is seen with RLAC COO Dr Jeff McNairy, Jeremy Geffen, and RLAC CEO Gerard Powell . Luxury stay:The boutique rehab center is located in tropical Guanacaste, Costa Rica, on a private estate only minutes from the beach . Scott's latest rehab stay came as it was revealed that he was found shoeless and drunk stumbling around his hotel lobby on Sunday morning after a paid appearance at an Atlantic City club. The previous evening he had been openly downing shots of tequila before taking the microphone to rant onstage. A hotel source told TMZ that the reality star had to be escorted back to his room by a supervisor. The club promoter had already made headlines by cancelling three club appearances while in the UK earlier this month, only letting fans know at the last minute via Twitter. Scott did not mention his recent troubles in his statement, instead explaining why he chose the center. 'While I have been unconvinced in the past of treatment and therapy methods, Rythmia's rehab approach puts my worries at ease,' he said. 'The fact that there is a money back guarantee that has never been called upon gives me even more confidence. I am looking forward to starting my therapy and iboga treatment there.' Scott will be treated with the controversial drug Ibogaine, which is made from the psychedelic African rainforest shrub iboga. Ibogaine reputedly causes hallucinations similar to LSD - it is banned in the U.S. Perhaps not the perfect job: Despite difficulties controlling his drinking, Scott continues to promote clubs; he is seen on Saturday at Harrah's Resort in Atlantic City - where he was later found wandering shoeless around his hotel lobby . And the center even offers 'shaman-supervised flights' while patients are taking the drug. While not undergoing treatment, Scott will certainly not be deprived. The boutique rehab center is located in tropical Guanacaste, Costa Rica, on a private estate only minutes from the beach. According to a press release it 'affords guests a secluded and serene environment with the utmost privacy.' As well as undergoing 'intensive' rehab the 31-year-old can also make use of the fitness center, five-star restaurant and full-service spa with mud bath. And indeed Scott knows exactly what he is committing to - having secretly visited the center in February. 'Scott was here last month,' Charles Johnston, director of addiction treatment at Rythmia told the magazine In Touch. And he added: 'It’s just getting him to the place where he’s ready to give up that lifestyle and hopefully that will happen soon.' Soldiering on: While her long-term partner is seeking treatment Kourtney Kardashian will be juggling the care of her three children - three-month-old Reign Aston [not seen], Mason, five, and Penelope, two . This is certainly not Scott's first spell in rehab - just last summer he spent time in a treatment facility, as fans saw on Kourtney and Khloe Take the Hamptons. It came after he was hospitalised for alcohol poisoning. The father-of-three's struggles to control his drinking have been a recurrent theme on the Kardashian reality shows, with viewers watching as Kourtney tries to support her long-term partner. And following the death of both Scott's parents within months of one another, he has spoken openly of his unhappiness and anxiety. Scott's mother Bonnie Disick, 63, passed away in October 2013 following a lengthy illness. His father, Jeffrey, died a few months later in January. 'I literally just want to jump out of my skin it's that bad,' he said of his anxiety on KAKTTH, admitting he was taking medication. Scott and Kourtney welcomed their youngest son in December, with little Reign Aston joining big brother Mason, five, and sister Penelope, two. A spokesperson for the family did not respond to requests for comment. Hands full: Kourtney takes Penelope to dance class last week .

Article text: As condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran wait on 'death island' for their latest appeal to go to court, it's been revealed that almost 200 Indonesians on death row around the world have had their sentences commuted over the last three years - at the request of the Indonesian government. 189 Indonesian death sentences were suspended thanks to diplomatic efforts - and in some cases, money paid - by Indonesia,The Sunday Telegraph reports. The Indonesians who won reprieves were convicted of crimes which included drug smuggling in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, China, Iran and Singapore. 'I am not requesting of Indonesia anything that Indonesia does not request of other nations where Indonesian citizens face the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told the Telegraph. 'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' she said in the Australian Parliament recently. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine pair Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan (left to right) , will have a legal appeal against their execution sentence heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday . 'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' Australia's Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop told Parliament recently . With an estimated 360 Indonesians facing the death penalty abroad - about 230 of those on drug charges - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has warned Indonesia's plans to proceed with the Bali Nine executions could risk the lives of its own citizens. Ms Bishop pointed to the case of Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad, an Indonesian maid who was saved  from beheading in Saudi Arabia by the previous Indonesian government after being convicted of murdering her elderly employer. It's reported Indonesia paid $2.1 million to stop the execution and that President Joko Widodo was among the politicians calling for mercy at the time. While President Widodo lobbies for his own people, he continues to reject Australia's appeals for clemency for the Bali Nine pair. Widodo told Al Jazeera Televsion that  his role, as Head of State, is to protect his citizens. 'But at the same time, we have to respect other countries that apply capital punishment,' he said. Last year, Indonesia made a substantial payment to a Saudi family to halt the impending execution of Indonesian maid, Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad.  Her sister-in-law, Sulastri, holds her photo in Central Java last year . Last month, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi told theJakarta Post that the Indonesian government was committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals  on death row around the world. 'The state is giving assistance by providing them with lawyers and regular visits in the prisons and carrying out diplomatic efforts with local authorities to solve the issue,' Retno told reporters. She also said President Widodo had ordered all Indonesian embassies and consulates 'to unite the death row convicts with their families as this would be helpful for their psychological well-being.' Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi says Indonesia is committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals on death row around the world - despite refusing to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Ms Bishop told the Australian Parliament last month that Indonesian organisations like  Migrant Care and the National Commission on Human Rights, say Indonesia's  policy of proceeding with executions at home 'would risk undermining its representations abroad.' Of Chan and Sukumaran, she said Australia will not give up hope. 'The families of these two young Australian men have spoken openly and in heartbreaking terms of their hopes for a stay of execution,' Ms Bishop said. 'The Australian government stands resolutely with both families, after all, Australia is only doing what Indonesia is doing: making representations on behalf of Indonesian families in support of Indonesian death row prisoners abroad.' 'I believe it is Indonesia that will lose the most from executing these two young men.' The legal appeal for condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday. It comes after Friday's news that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's executions have been indefinitely delayed due to ongoing legal proceedings. The delay and new appeal have been welcomed by the pair's legal team, as well as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, both of whom have voiced their optimism at the prospect for a repeal to the execution sentence, reports Yahoo News. The new appeal will be the men's second challenge to the clemency bid which was rejected in January. Julian McMahon (C), the lawyer for Bali Nine pair. The condemned Australian's legal team said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of the Indonesian Government' Michael O'Connell, one of the lawyers for the two Australians, said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo. 'The indications that we've had yesterday are encouraging because there does now appear to be some regard to his principles.' Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped the appeal represented a possible shift in the stance of the Indonesian government. 'There could be other reasons for the delay but I hope, in my heart, that it's a change of mind,' she said. Drug trafficker Scott Rush is led away for interrogation at Bali Police Headquarters. The now 29 year old has voiced his sympathy for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran after hearing they will face the firing squad . It comes after Scott Rush- one of the Bali Nine members who had his sentence changed from death to life in prison-has spoken out about his sympathy for the pair. Rush, 29, told The Weekend Australian via a friend he was 'shocked and heartbroken' by news of the their fate. 'I am praying for Myuran and Andrew and for the other condemned prisoners that even at this time mercy can't be shown,' he said. 'I send love and prayers to the families and loved ones. May God bless them all,' Mr Rush reportedly said. One of the Brisbane man's lawyers said that while his client was saddened by the destiny of the condemned duo, the reports he felt guilty were inaccurate. Scroll down for video .

News has also surfaced that Chan and Sukumaran's families have been blocked from visiting them on Nusakambangan Island. Australian consular officials are seeking leniency for the devastated families, but Indonesian Officials have vowed there will be no concessions made. 'No exception. We can't make allowances for certain families only. It won't be fair for the others,'  Central Java Justice Officer Mirza Zukarnain told The Age.

Foreign  Minister Julie Bishop described the image as 'undignified and degrading' in a formal complaint lodged on Thursday . Tensions between Indonesia and Australia are also running high, with Australia lodging a formal complaint to the Indonesian ambassador on Thursday over the treatment of the two men during their transfer to death island. Scores of heavily armed police accompanied Chan and Sukumaran during the transfer, during which an image was taken that sparked national outrage.

Article text: An NC State player directed some pretty sour words at President Obama after the eighth-seeded Wolfpack advanced to the Sweet 16 with a win over the No. 1 Villanova Wildcats on Saturday night. NC State's Anthony 'Cat' Barber appeared to curse at the president while addressing his teammates in the locker room following the squad's unexpected 71-68 victory. President Obama had picked Villanova to defeat NC State and advance all the way to the NCAA title game before ultimately falling to undefeated Kentucky. Scroll down for video . After NC State's big win, Anthony 'Cat' Barber (pictured center, No. 12) directed a curse at President Obama . The 20-year-old guard (right) had 13 points, three rebounds and three assists in the 71-68 victory on Saturday . NC State's win over No. 1 seed Villanova busted Obama's bracket as he had the Wildcats going to the final . While the team was huddled up in the locker room after the win, Barber questioned why President Obama picked against the Wolfpack. He appeared to say: 'What the f**k [is] wrong with Barack Obama?' Obama did have the NC State-Villanova matchup correct on his bracket. It doesn't really matter, because the Wolfpack are back in the Sweet 16. Forward BeeJay Anya said: 'We came out today with the feeling that everybody expected us to lose to a one seed. 'But we believe in ourselves and that we're good enough to beat anybody in the country and we went down and did it.' Villanova saw its 16-game winning streak end and the team has not reached the second weekend since 2009 . It was a huge win for the eighth-seeded Wolfpack and they will move on to the Sweet 16 in Syracuse, New York . President Obama has been releasing his bracket for seven straight years. He has only selected the correct tournament winner once. The POTUS predicted the North Carolina Tar Heels would win the NCAA title in 2009 and they delivered. If Kentucky wins it all this year, it will be the second time President Obama picked the big winner of the Big Dance correctly. President Obama has  only selected the correct tournament winner once in six previous public attempts . After Saturday's win, Barber and backcourt mate Desmond Lee shared a long embrace as their teammates danced around the court in celebration. He turned to Lee, pounded his chest and yelled: 'All heart!' The 20-year-old guard had 13 points, three rebounds and three assists in the win. Barber got the nickname 'Cat' when he was a child after his sister Pam noticed his quick moves, according to MaxPreps. The Wolfpack (22-13) have designs on their own big March run and will move on to Syracuse, New York to play the winner of the Louisville-Northern Iowa game. Trevor Lacey led them with 17 points and Abdul-Malik Abu had 13 points, 12 rebounds and absolutely destroyed the Wildcats inside. Coach Mark Gottfried said 'We respect Villanova, but we've seen good teams. 'We've seen a lot of them in our conference. 'You see them about every night. So a league like that prepares you for games like tonight.' NC State has wins over Duke, North Carolina and Louisville in ACC play. Villanova lost after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament . Villanova (33-3) saw a 16-game winning streak end and the team has not reached the second weekend since 2009. The Wildcats come up empty after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament opener. Coach Jay Wright said: 'I know we have to answer to the fact that we did not get to the second weekend again. 'We have to own that. 'But it's not going to define us within our program. 'It's going to define us outside of our program and we accept that.'

Article text: Arsene Wenger has insisted there is no European crisis for English clubs despite a second year out of three with no representatives in the last eight of the Champions League – but he does believe it is time to change the away-goals rule. Arsenal and Chelsea both crashed out of the competition on away goals in the first knockout stage, beaten by Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Wenger, however, has long championed a change to the rule. Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League on away goals despite beating Monaco on Tuesday . Monaco scored three away goals at the Emirates which proved to be the difference in the tie . If at the end of two-legged tie the score is level, the team that has scored the most goals away from home is declared the winner. For example, Monaco beat Arsenal 3-1 away from home before losing 2-0 in Monte Carlo. With the score tied at 3-3, Monaco progressed courtesy of having scored on more goal on their travels. 'That's a rule that's outdated now and should be changed,' the Arsenal boss said. 'It should count maybe after extra-time. It was created in the 1960s to get teams to attack away from home. 'Since then football has changed and the weight of the away goals is too big today. Maybe count it after extra-time like in the League Cup in England. 'I think the quality of Premier League is high and physical demands are extreme but I'm not in the mood to analyse too much what's wrong with English football. I don't think there's a lot wrong.' Wenger must pick up his players ahead of Saturday's game at Newcastle as the battle for a top-four finish in the Premier League continues. He added: 'The mood is down and we are disappointed. The tie lasted 180 minutes and we were not cautious enough in the first 90. We know why we went out, it's down to a dreadful defensive performance in the first leg. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants the away-goals rule changed in European competition . Manchester City were the third English club to be knocked out at the last-16 stage after they lost to Barcelona . 'We must focus on next targets and we have to continue to improve. We are better today than four months ago. 'Let's keep that attitude. There's a fantastic spirit and great quality. Let's rectify what we didn't do well in first game and continue to improve. 'We've won 13 of the last 15 and that's down to quality and improvement. We are not in a transfer period. Ninety-five per cent of the players will still be here next season and what is important is their attitude and improvement. We are in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, and in a strong fight in the Premier League. We can do that straight away on Saturday. 'We're on a good run. We won the game in Monaco. We're frustrated and disappointed to go out but that's down to our home performance especially on the defensive front. We were a bit unlucky as well. If you look at shots on target by Monaco in the two games they've been quite efficient.'

Article text: Five pensioners have been killed in their homes in a stabbing spree in rural Japan allegedly by a neighbour who had tweeted about stalking and telepathy before the killings. The suspect was named by police as Tatsuhiko Hirano, an unemployed man reportedly described as a 'hikikomori' - or social misfit. Police found the bloodied bodies of a man and a woman, both aged around 80, in the main house on the site on the quiet island of Awajishima . Two unconscious women, aged around 60 and 80, were discovered in another building, while a badly wounded man in his 60s was found outside. All three were rushed to hospital and were later confirmed dead, police said. Massacre in rural Japan: Detectives comb the scene in Sumoto city on the Japanese island of Awajishima where five pensioners were stabbed to death by a neighbour who has reportedly confessed to the killings . The alarm was raised by a 32-year-old woman who rang police to say her parents had been stabbed. The 40-year-old suspect is being quizzed by detectives, but the motive was unclear and police have yet to find the weapon used in the attacks. Local media said Hirano's clothes were spattered with blood and that he had admitted to the multiple killing. A Twitter account that appeared to be run by the suspect had been used over the past month. Tweets included one with the address of the homicides and a map of the scene. Other tweets appeared to be about telepathy and stalking. The attacks happened in Sumoto, a small city on an island in western Japan, said deputy police chief Keizo Okumoto. Hirano lives in the area with his father and grandmother, Jiji Press reported. Locals told the agency he rarely leaves his home and has largely been isolated from society since his school days. Map showing Awajishima in Japan where police arrested a man suspected of stabbing five people to death . The phenomenon of so-called 'hikikomori' -- literally 'the withdrawn' -- rears its head fairly frequently in Japan. Often it applies to maladjusted people in their teens or early 20s who shut themselves away for years in their parents' homes, many living in darkened bedrooms with little or no human contact. While many eventually emerge, others continue well into adulthood, protected from the pressures of life by their ageing parents. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan and even more so in most small towns. Sumoto, a city of 44,000 people on Awaji island, is known for its oranges, onions and Awaji beef. Japanese television stations showed the victims' homes surrounded by agricultural fields. 'Normally, we get one call a day, if that,' Mr Okumoto said. 'And usually it's about a bike theft or someone getting beaten up.'

Article text: It all began with a joke but resulted in an incredible cash windfall for a 23-year-old, who has used the opportunity to treat his mother who raised him single-handedly. In January Sydney-based Mat Carpenter, then 22, made global headlines with his kooky business idea to help people get revenge by shipping envelopes filled with glitter to their enemies. He was astonished when the website, ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com went viral, attracting so much attention that just ten days after its inception he sold the website for an incredible six-figure sum. 'I was blown away by the success of the website,' Mr Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was completely unaware of how successful the idea was going to become. 'I started off with no glitter & no envelopes which sort of shows you how much I didn't believe in what I thought was a stupid idea.' Scroll down for video . Mathew Carpenter's mum (right) was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the surprise . His mother had no idea where she was or what was in store as she was led over to the car . He sold the domain for $US 85,000. Although he joked it was the equivalent of '$11 in Australia', incredibly Carpenter pocketed over $AUD 100 000 . Rather than indulging himself with a lavish lifestyle, the first thing Mr Carpenter wanted to do was take the chance to thank his mother. Mr Carpenter bought his mother her first ever new car for her birthday to say thank you for her sacrifices for her children. 'Buying a car for mum was a no brainer,' Mr Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. 'Her old car was (rubbish) that only liked to work when it could be bothered which is basically a lazier version of me. 'When you're growing up with a single parent & see them working three or four jobs at a time just to put a roof over your head it's extremely rewarding to give back.' The brains behind the business left his mum speechless after she was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the amazing surprise. The 23-year-old's mum had been relying on family and friends to drive her to and from work after her car broke down three months ago and she couldn't afford to get it fixed. The group arrives at a car dealership where a pink Mitsubishi complete with a huge matching pink bow adorned with white balloons awaits . The footage shows his mother blindfolded in the front seat of the car throughout the 40-minute trip. With a glass of wine in hand, she gets into the spirit by grooving to the music on the radio. 'Mum, where do you think you are right now?' Mathew asks. 'I have no idea,' she replies. 'Do you know where we're going?' 'Nup,' says Ms Carpenter, making dance moves in her seat. 'She's drunk,' a female voice can be heard to say. The group arrives at a car dealership where a pink Mitsubishi complete with a huge matching pink bow adorned with white balloons awaits. She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw her first ever brand new car in front of her . Difficult to grasp what was happening, his mother silently walked over to the car . As she is guided by her daughter to the car she comments that it: 'it feels like we have gone around in a circle' when Mathew confirms that she had. He then says 'mum take your blindfold off' which she does and turns away after being blinded by the sunlight. Mathew goes on to proudly announce the generous gift: 'mum this is your brand new car.' His mother managed to say 'oh my god' in between her jaw dropping to the floor and clapping her hands in delight. Difficult to grasp what was happening, she silently walked to the car. She slowly gets in the pink vehicle and looked around in a state of shock when Mathew asked her if she liked his kind deed. 'Oh my god it's amazing,' she eventually said looking in awe at her first ever brand new car. It's an incredible start for the young entrepreneur who clearly has a lot of promise - particularly when it comes to quirky concepts. 'My plans going forward is to continue on with my New Years resolution of working on more projects,' he said. 'I'm currently developing a mobile application for both Android & iOS and we'll be accepting BETA users at the end of this month. 'I can't go into too much detail but as you can imagine any project I'm involved with is going to be a bit offbeat.' She slowly got in the car and looked around in a state of shock when Mathew asked her if she liked his gift . 'Oh my god it's amazing,' she eventually said looking in awe at the brand spanking new car .

Post service employee Andrea Bunar's route takes her along a canal system, located about 60 miles south of Berlin . In addition to being an environmentally-friendly method, it is rather easy for mail carrier Andrea Bunar, who gets a workout as she paddles up and down the canals. She delivers everything from letters to large parcels on a yellow post barge that measures nine metres in length. She uses her own strength to propel the boat along the narrow channels to more than 60 addresses each day. She covers about five miles every day and has been delivering the post by boat for almost five years. The picturesque village is set in Germany's Spreewald landscape, which is irrigated with 200 small canals . Lehde is known as the 'city of punts and pickles', with life revolving around punting and the famous 'Spreewaldgurken' pickles .

Article text: John Davies: Police are still working to track down the conman . A flamboyant conman who funded an extravagant lifestyle by swindling £750,000 from struggling businesses has gone missing after being convicted of fraud. John Davies, 53, of Milton Keynes, left a trail of misery in his wake, with 'numerous' people losing their jobs and companies as a result of his actions. After his six-week trial police detailed how he had lived a 'flamboyant lifestyle on the back of despicable crimes', buying a house complete with the latest cinema system and a luxury kitchen. On Wednesday, he was found guilty in his absence of 12 counts of fraud by breach of trust. Police have since issued a warrant for his arrest. The court case, at Aylesbury Crown Court in Buckinghamshire, related to Davies' dealings with nine different companies where he gained in excess of £750,000. He was convicted of 11 counts by a unanimous jury decision, and one by a majority verdict. The court was told how he had spent his ill-gotten gains on a luxury lifestyle, including more than £70,000 on a new Range Rover and foreign holidays to Barbados and Las Vegas. Davies, of Dean Forest Way, Broughton, Milton Keynes, claimed to be an insolvency and business adviser but he was not licensed. Between 2007 and 2013 he targeted distressed companies, claiming he could help restructure their debts. But although he often advised companies they should go into liquidation or administration, he would delay doing so in order to gain control of companies' remaining assets which he used for his own personal gain. The prosecution said he gained his victims' trust and then took the money that was due to the company creditors which he then spent on himself. His swindles - carried out in Theale in Berkshire, Kent, and Northamptonshire - meant people lost their jobs, livelihoods and companies. Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit spent more than two years collating evidence against him. Following the trial investigating officer Detective Constable Stephanie Burleigh said: 'I am very grateful to all the victims and witnesses who took the time to come to court and give statements to support the proceedings against this serial fraudster. 'Company fraud is not a victimless crime, Davies ruined many livelihoods and Thames Valley Police take these crimes seriously. Davies kept a lavish £70,000 Range Rover along with other trappings of the jet-set lifestyle (file photo) The fraudster used his ill-gotten money to pay for luxury holidays to Las Vegas (left) and Barbados (right) 'Davies has led a flamboyant lifestyle on the back of these despicable crimes which have caused so much misery up and down the country. 'He is an accomplished and manipulative con-artist who does not care about the consequences of his actions. 'I appeal to anyone who knows where he is to contact the police immediately so that he can serve his sentence.' His conviction comes two years after being cleared of murdering his wife during their honeymoon to India. Colette Davies, 39, from Bridgend, was found dead at the bottom of a 80ft ravine in a remote part of the country in February 2004. In 2011 he was charged with murder and two counts of fraud, relating to allegations he fraudulently claimed £132,000 from a life insurance policy. In March 2013 he was cleared of all charges at Cardiff Crown Court when the prosecution produced no evidence against him.

Article text: Construction workers  have been forced to build a £10 million road project around two apartment blocks in China after several families refused to move. The embarrassing rebuke by the ten households has forced developers to curve the major new route around the properties in the city of Yongjia, in eastern China's Zhejiang province, The People's Daily reports. Officials launched the multi-million pound blueprint to much fanfare, saying the new 10-mile provincial road would provide a fast and efficient route between the city and 19 surrounding villages. In the way: The two building are in the direct path of the £10 million road project in Yongjia, eastern China . But although work started in December 2011, construction was forced to stop when 10 families refused to accept the compensation offered to allow their properties to be demolished. This year local council officials lost their patience and ordered the road builders to go around the properties. The four-lane highway opened last month with many drivers arguing the bizarre layout is dangerous. Won't budge: Ten families have refused to leave their homes, that are in the path of a new road, until they are offered a fair price . Road rage: Officials ordered the new thoroughfare to be built around the two buildings 10 families have refused to leave in Yongjia . In China, it is common practice to ask people to move out of their homes to make way for important public sector developments. People who refuse are known as 'nail homeowners' - a term which comes from the nuisance a nail causes when stuck in a fence post. The homeowners say they are happy to move but only if they are offered a fair price so they can afford a new property and be compensated for the inconvenience of leaving homes where they were perfectly happy. Around the houses: Drivers have complained the revised road layout is dangerous after the No.41 provincial route opened last month . Jun Lo, 40, who lives in one of the properties with his wife and parents said they would not be bullied into leaving. He said: 'They tried all sorts of mean tricks to get other people to move out, but me and the others won't budge now because we don't want to be bullied. 'If they want us to go, then they need to pay a decent price otherwise we are just going to sit here.'

Article text: It was just over two months ago that McDonald's released an advertisement stating it 'will never be kale'. But it seems the fast food giant may be having a change of heart regarding the trendy super food, with a new report suggesting that McDonald's plans to introduce kale to its menu soon. Janney Capital Markets restaurant analysts wrote that 'one of our industry sources indicates that McDonald's U.S. plans to roll out kale as an ingredient in its restaurants at some point in the not-too-distant future.' Scroll down for video . McHipster? Despite running this ad just weeks ago, it's been reported that McDonald's will begin to offer kale on its menu in the near future . Janney analyst Mark Kalinowski told CNN the move could mean kale salads and even smoothies may be on the horizon and said the company's goal is to appear healthier or of a higher quality. 'McDonald's clearly aims to raise consumers' perception of the quality of its food. Adding kale to the menu in some way could help be a step in this direction,' he wrote. However, McDonald's stayed mum when questioned about the superfood, telling CNN, in part: 'we're always looking at new and different ingredients.' Either way, don't expect your future Big Macs to be piled with the curly greens. Six weeks ago, the fast food mega chain debuted a commercial in which the words 'WILL NEVER BE KALE' appeared in block letters over the signature burger's lettuce layer. The news comes after McDonald's on Monday vowed to remake itself as a 'modern, progressive burger company' after aggressive competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and myriad 'better burger' chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales last month. February ended the run of former Chief Executive Don Thompson. His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades. Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1. Leafy: The trendy vegetable would likely be offered in the form of salads and smoothies, say analysts . Moving on up: Reports of the new McMenu item come just after the company's announced intention Monday to become a more 'modern, progressive burger company' The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food. In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month. Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year. McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize 'Lovin,' a play on the company's ubiquitous 'I'm lovin' it' tagline. Still, one pension fund adviser on Monday renewed its call for McDonald's to shake up its board. 'Today's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms McDonald's requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board,' said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of McDonald's shares.

Article text: A five-year-old managed to start an electric car then crashed into a baby in a buggy at a shopping centre in China. The mischievous boy got into the new white Model S Tesla on display and started the ignition at the mall in Beijing, The People's Daily reports. The car moved forward six metres and crashed straight into a red pushchair with a young child inside. The stroller fell over and the youngster, who was grabbed by its mother, was fortunately unhurt. Baby bump: A five-year-old started an electric car on display in a shopping mall in Beijing, crashing into a pushchair. The young child in the buggy (circled here) was not hurt in the incident . Eyewitness Lok Cheng, 36, told local TV: 'There were loads of kids messing around with the cars, even though it was in a roped off area. 'The car started up but only moved forward at a slow speed, and the woman didn't realise because she had her back to it and the engine made no sound. 'They moved the car back afterwards but you could still see kids playing with it, so I don't think they treated the problem that seriously. At least not until the police turned up.' Road rage: People stand to discuss how a five-year-old boy was able to start up the car on public display . Aftermath: The exact path of the car, which was driven by a five-year-old, can be seen as crowds gather to at the scene. The mother and baby, who were knocked over by the car, are circled next to the buggy . The car was in the middle of the shopping centre in the Chinese capital as part of an exhibition featuring two of the new cars which were on display to the public. The sales team were explaining some of the finer points of the car when the boy opened the door of the white Tesla and climbed inside apparently planning to pretend to drive it. Locked: Another young child tries to get into the car following the incident at a shopping mall in Beijing . At rest: The white Model S can be seen lying in front of the exhibition. Crowds gather to look at the scene . Somehow he managed to start the car up and drove it forward, knocking down the woman and the child she had inside the buggy. It has earned him the nickname 'bear child' in China which is a local expression for children who are left to run amok. The mother and baby were left shaken but unharmed and the family have now filed a complaint with the police. The authorities are investigating why the cars were not locked, allowing the child to get in. Cordoned off: Where the new car should be, behind a tape barrier, at the Tongzhou Wanda Plaza Mall in Beijing . No action will be taken against the young driver but organisers of the exhibit and the shopping centre management at Tongzhou Wanda Plaza Mall could face censure for not taking more care. Neither the management or the car showroom organisers commented on Sunday's incident.

Article text: Click here to read Matt Lawton on how the Liverpool boss put his faith in 3-4-3 . Liverpool have not suffered Premier League defeat since falling 3-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Sunday’s match at Anfield is a measure of how far they have come. United have been more hit and miss in that period, but still only lost twice in the league. They produced their best display of the season in the 3-0 victory over Tottenham. Plenty of players have improved, some have faded, while Brendan Rodgers and Louis Van Gaal have toyed with their systems. Here, Sportsmail looks at how a composite XI of the sides might take shape, choosing the 3-4-3 formation favoured by Liverpool to fit as many attackers in as possible. Why not. The Liverpool and Manchester United composite XI selected by Sportsmail . Goalkeeper – David de Gea . The outstanding goalkeeper in England and arguably the best in the world right now. Seems to pull off a save a real substance every game, offers good distribution, and exudes calm from his penalty box. David de Gea has been outstanding between the sticks for Manchester United this season . Centre-back – Chris Smalling . A surprise perhaps, but turned in one of his best games in a United shirt against Spurs. He was strong, brought the ball out with assurance, and picked a pass more than once. Chris Smalling produced one of his best performances of the season in United's win over Spurs last week . Centre-back – Michael Carrick . Not his ideal position but for want of excellent defenders could easily operate here. His anticipation and experience are valuable. A breathe of air to United’s team after returning from injury. Michael Carrick celebrates his goal in Man United's 3-0 win over Spurs at Old Trafford last weekend . Centre-back – Emre Can . Has blossomed in his converted role in Liverpool’s back three. Deceptively quick because of his hulking frame, and an excellent ball player. Emre Can . Right wing-back – Adam Lallana . Such a skilful player clever enough to function in a variety of positions. Offers energy and trickery down the flank and a threat when cutting in. Liverpool's Adam Lallana takes on Neil Taylor during last week's 1-0 win at Swansea City . Left wing-back – Ashley Young . Has enjoyed a really consistent season and seems to be growing under Van Gaal. A menace down the left n recent games with renewed drive and end product. Ashley Young rampages down the wing against Tottenham's Nacer Chadli during last Sunday's match . Centre midfield – Philippe Coutinho . Dazzling talent and goal threat from any range. The oil to make the midfield cogs roll seamlessly along and possesses the imagination to unlock defences in the final third. Philippe Coutinho celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal against Southampton last month . Centre midfield – Jordan Henderson . The steely core to the team and the best-performing midfielder in England right now. Two stunning goals from distance in his recent back catalogue and a formidable mentality to seep across the side. Jordan Henderson celebrates his important winner for Liverpool against Swansea last Monday . Right wing – Raheem Sterling . Brings whippet pace to stretch defenders and is illustrating his flexibility by coping intelligently to requests by Rodgers for positional changes. An absolute terror at his optimum. Raheem Sterling takes on Swansea's Jack Cork during Liverpool victory at Swansea . Left wing – Daniel Sturridge . Has not yet burst to life since his comeback from injury, but offering enough glimpses to force his way into this imaginary line-up. A potent scoring danger and able to assist as well. Daniel Sturridge celebrates in hallmark fashion after scoring against West Ham at Anfield in January . Striker – Wayne Rooney . Back to his best as a snarling centre-forward, with five goals in his last six games, so let him continue there. Vast experience, vast ability and a ferocious desire to win. Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring United's third goal against Tottenham at Old Trafford last weekend . So six Liverpool players to five from United, eight Englishmen, and a team full of attacking intent. Marouane Fellaini would be first off the substitutes bench to offer a physical presence up front.

The identity of the deceased Pi Kappa Alpha (aka PIKE) member has not yet been released, but he was reportedly found unconscious at the frat's house on Lee Street around 10:30am. Neighbors told Fox Carolina that the house threw a party the night before and on Wednesday there was still a keg and St Patrick's Day decorations outside the home. Scroll down for video . Suspended: The Pi Kappa Alpha house at the University of South Carolina has been suspended, after a brother was found dead in a house Wednesday morning . Rager? Neighbors said the house had a party the night before, on St Patrick's Day. On Wednesday, several stray cups and a keg were seen on the porch, as well as clover decorations . 'I would say there are three houses there, and I don't know who exactly lives in them, but there's always a frequency of parties going on,' neighbor Mehrdad Vejdani said. 'At times, there can be a hundred people in that place. Live band in the backyard, which is fine. I mean, some noise, but it doesn't bother us too much.' While the Columbia Police Department and Richland County Coroner's Office labeled the death as 'suspicious,' authorities said there was no signs of foul play or trauma on the body. An autopsy and toxicology test are scheduled for Thursday. Responding the tragic incident, PIKE's national office released a statement saying the USC chapter had been placed on leave pending the investigation. 'The fraternity’s thoughts and prayers are with the family of this young man and the brothers of Xi Chapter,' the statement read. 'There are a lot of rumors out there about the circumstances surrounding the death but at this point the matter remains under investigation,' University of South Carolina spokesman Wes Hickman said. 'While we await further information we are focused on helping our community grieve and heal.' This is just the second incident at a PIKE house this week. Last Friday, the University of Connecticut chapter lost recognition for hazing members, providing alcohol to underage students and harassing women. PIKE was founded in 1868 at the University of Virginia and has now grown to include some 220 groups across the U.S. and Canada. The house has been plagued by controversy before. In November 2012, a 19-year-old student at Northern Illinois University died after a night of heavy drinking. Five frat members were charged with felonies for hazing and the chapter was suspended indefinitely. That same year, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville chapter was suspended indefinitely when a 20-year-old member was hospitalized for reportedly ingesting wine through his anus.

Article text: A group of pranksters managed to trick more than a dozen art lovers into thinking that a cheap print from IKEA was a valuable work of modern art. Dutch YouTube jokers lifehunterstv took a £7(10 euro) print and placed it in an art museum in Arnhem, and asked visitors what they thought of the 'painting' and how much it could be worth. Several art fans praised the IKEA print, with some valuing it to £1.8million(2.5million euro), before being told of the hoax. Funny guys: A group of Dutch YouTube jokers took a £7 print from IKEA and placed it in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem . The team from lifehunterstv placed the cheap canvas on display in the Museum for Modern Art in Arnhem, and asked art lovers for an appraisal. They told visitors the painting was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews', and, according to the pranksters, all of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie. The video shows presenter Boris Lange talking about the painting to a number of visitors, who call the cheap print 'modern' and 'shocking'. One man praises the print for its 'constructiveness of things on top of each other, inside each other'. Another  visitor, a man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism', adding that the artist has a 'beautiful spirit'. Joke: Presenter Boris Lange told visitors the 'painting' was done by famous Swedish artist 'IKE Andrews' and say everyone of the nearly 20 people interviewed bought the lie . A man in a flatcap, beard and glasses, claims he can 'clearly see that it concerns a form of symbolism' When asked how much they believe the artwork to be worth, one guesses 'over 1,000 euro', while another says: 'If you could buy this for 2.5million euros, I'd do it.' 'The whole day everyone thought our "painting" amazing,' the team behind the prank says. 'When the people talked about that this image is a symbol of the painters spirit, and that it could be worth a 200,000 euros or even 2.5million euros it made us laugh inside!' When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side, but, lifehunterstv reveals, not all were pleased about being duped. 'The last two guys couldn't even say one word as a reaction and just walked away with red cheeks. We could feel the awkwardness'. Taking it well: When the pranksters told the art fans about their IKEA hoax, a majority saw the funny side . Hit a nerve? Two men who had praised the painting were so offended when told that it was a cheap IKEA print that they left without a word . This comes just days after IKEA customers in the Netherlands were stopped from organising a mass-game of hide and seek. A whopping 19,000 people signed up to a Facebook group promoting a game at IKEA's Amsterdam branch next month, and another 13,000 signed up for a game in the Ikea store in the city of Utrecht. But the Swedish retail giant has bad news for folks wanting to hide among its room-like furniture displays: The numbers signing up are getting out of hand and the events have been blocked. 'We have contacted these pages on social media and humbly asked them to have their hide and seek games somewhere else,' IKEA spokeswoman Martina Smedberg said Tuesday. Ms Smedberg added that IKEA does not want to be a spoilsport, but safety comes first.

Flooding of homes and businesses is expected in North Tyneside and Sunderland as well as the Somerset coast and the Wye Estuary at Brockweir. High tides have been forecast for the next two days, according to data by the National Tidal and Sea Level Facility. Tides will be 2.5m higher than other times in Milford Haven, south Wales, 1.5m higher in Plymouth, Devon, and the Isle of Mull, western Scotland, and 0.5m higher in London on the tidal Thames. Flood alerts were  issued for parts of Teddington and Twickenham as well as the River Avon and Devon coast. An EA spokesman said: 'These are spring tides, and higher due to the moon's 18-year cycle. High tides may lead to spray on promenades.' The Scottish Environment Protection Agency said: 'Spring tides are expected. There may be high waves.'

Article text: Guan Quanzi was bitten by a panicked wild panda that had been chased onto his land in China by officials when they found it was roaming free in a village and may still need his leg amputated . A man may lose his leg after he was attacked by a wild panda as it was chased by locals after it wandered into a village in China. Guan Quanzhi was set upon by the panda, which sunk its teeth into his leg, as officials chased it into his land in Liziba village near Longnan City in Gansu Province. A quick thinking villager threw a coat over the animal's head which made it let go of Mr Quanzhi who was left severely injured. He had to have a seven hour operation to try and repair the damage. In the last year Mr Quanzhi has spent months in hospital and had a total of eight operations. He has recently been told he may have to have his leg amputated, according to the People's Daily online. 'When the giant panda sunk its teeth into my leg the pain was indescribable. Blood was everywhere,' said Mr Quanzhi. Pandas have a 'cuddly' reputation but can be territorial. They have strong jaws which enable them to strip bamboo but this also means they can deliver a powerful bite. The incident took place on March 1 last year when the panda wandered into a village near Longnan City in Gansu Province. Locals attempted to capture the animal only for it to flee them and run into Mr Quanzhi's land. Mr Quanzhi, who is in his 60s, added: 'I was working at home and saw many people running in my direction, looking closer I could see a mud-covered panda being chased.' As the animal saw Mr Quanzhi was blocking its path he sunk its teeth into its leg until someone threw a coat over it. The panda fled and disappeared after being seen wandering around in the mountains for more than half an hour. Locals realised Mr Quanzhi was seriously injured and he was taken to Qingchuan County People's hospital, which was more than 10km away, for emergency treatment. The next day Mr Quanzhi had to endure a seven hour operation to repair the broken bone in his leg and stem a ruptured vein. He was in hospital for two months. Because of his family's financial circumstances the village council and the Forestry Bureau  borrowed 70,000 yuan (£7,500) and 30,000 yuan (£3,000) respectively. The panda was seen roaming around the village and attacked Mr Quanzi, sinking its teeth into his leg . The panda, normally a docile animal, was chased and is believed to have panicked when it bit Mr Quanzi . Officials had been chasing the panda after they realised the wild animal was roaming around the village . Mr Quanzi has been forced to endure eight operations and weeks in hospital since he was bitten by the panda . His son said: 'My father stayed in hospital for 57 days, during this time he had skin grafts as well as various operations. 'After so much suffering and over such a long period of time part of his leg muscles have slowly shrunk and this has led to him not being able to walk on his leg and no longer being able to look after himself.' Mr Quanzhi was told that because his recovery has been unsatisfactory he is likely to need further surgery and may need to have his leg amputated. He took the Provincial Forestry Department, Longnan City's County Forestry Bureau and the Whitewater River National Nature Reserve Administration, home to around 100 wild pandas, to court. The animal had wandered into the village and is believed to have been looking for food when it was spotted . Experts have warned that while pandas have a 'cute and cuddly' reputation they do have strong jaws . The panda (centre) was seen wandering around Liziba Village and was spotted by locals who reported it . He was recently awarded 520,000 yuan (£56,000) in compensation from the three parties. 'Although giant panda's are generally docile, they are still wild animals, and are territorial,' Director of the Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre of China, Zhang Hemin. 'Pandas rarely ever attack people, but if people enter their territory they will attack in self-defense as a warning.' The animals are an important draw for tourists in China, and several are rented out to zoos. They have also been known to attack people in the past. In 2008 a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who scaled a 6ft tall barrier to climb into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. The panda was apparently scared by the intruder and bit the man on his arms and legs.

Article text: Recent killings by an unidentified croc slayer in the Northern Territory, who's gone as far as skinning and beheading saltwater crocodiles, has sparked deep concerns among wildlife and conservation groups. One crocodile was recently found at Dundee Beach, southwest of Darwin, which is where a previous two  were brutally mutilated earlier in the month. A crocodile conservationist says such incidents have 'gone on forever' in the Northern Territory but are now distressingly on the rise. Recent killings by an unidentified croc slayer in the Northern Territory has sparked deep concerns among wildlife and conservation groups . A crocodile conservationist says such incidents have 'gone on forever' in the Northern Territory but are now distressingly on the rise . Mr Edlund says it is illegal to kill protected wildlife, which include crocodiles, with the maximum penalty being a $74,500 fine or five years behind bars . While it is unknown whether the suspected croc killer is working alone or with others, it is believed a fisherman could be responsible for the recent murders of saltwater crocodiles in the area. NT Parks and Wildlife spokesman Edwin Edlund says he is 'disturbed' by the recent killings. 'It is more likely there has been human involvement in these recent incidents,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If it is the same person who is doing this multiple times, who knows when the next incident will be.' Mr Edlund says it is illegal to kill protected wildlife, which include crocodiles, with the maximum penalty being a $74,500 fine or five years behind bars. Mr Edlund says he receives about 10 reports of such incidents each year, most of which involve firearms. However he says there are no official reports issued by those who found the dead animals on the beach and urged them to come forward. 'We heavily rely on the public to come forward with evidence and report these incidents,' he said. 'So it's very hard for us to pursue any inquiries without reports.' Mr Edlund urged anyone with information to call NT Parks and Wildlife on 0419 822 859 or NT Police on 131 444 . The spokeswoman for NT Crocodile Conservation and Protection Society told Daily Mail Australia she was 'disgusted' by the latest killings and believes the culprit could be a fisherman. Broady, who only revealed her first name, says residents and passers-by have been sending her images of the 'brutal and inhumane' incidents. The most recent being Rachel Maddox who told Broady she discovered the croc on Friday. 'This has gone on forever in the Northern Territory and it's only just getting exposed,' Broady said. 'It happens all the time and it's increasing. It's so unregulated here, it's ridiculous. 'Crocodiles are a protected species but no one cares. 'If this happened to a koala, the country would be livid.' Mr Edlund urged anyone with information to call NT Parks and Wildlife on 0419 822 859 or NT Police on 131 444.

Article text: Budget prices: Aldi is introducing Wagyu burgers at £2.99 each in a bid to chase from New Zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers . An A list celebrity might spend £29 on a Wagyu burger at London’s Dorchester Hotel – after all it is renowned around the world as a byword for luxury given its flavour and succulence. Alternatively, you could try the local Aldi, where the budget chain is introducing Wagyu burgers at £2.99 each. The budget chain is to offer a limited stock of Wagyu burgers made with beef imported from New Zealand as it steps up its chase for middle and high income shoppers. Normally, luxury restaurants, stores and gourmet butchers sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering £100 per kilo – so putting it out of reach for most families. However, Aldi is bringing the beef, which originated with pampered cattle in Japan, to the masses. Last year the company sold Wagyu sirloin and rib-eye steaks at £6.99 each, which resulted in something of a stampede among the BMW-driving classes. It believes the burgers will be similarly successful. Wagyu beef stands out from other meat because of its distinctive marbling with fat, which melts into the meat during cooking to produce a fabulous taste and moist texture. The cattle were initially introduced to Japan as a beast of burden to help cultivate rice during the 2nd century. Beer was fed to the animals during the hot summers to stimulate appetite, while massaging was used to prevent muscles cramping on small farms in Japan where the animals did not have sufficient room to move around. Kobe beef is the purest, highest quality of the meat, which is produced from the black Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle and raised according to strict tradition. However, the demand and appetite for the beef is now so great that herds are now being reared across the globe, including the UK and New Zealand. Beef from Wagyu cows is sold for as much as £100 per kilo in luxury restaurants and gourmet butchers . Aldi said the decision to stock the burgers was inspired by the menu at the Oscars ball. Stars such as Bradley Cooper, Eddie Redmayne and Julianne Moore were amongst the 1,500 members of Hollywood royalty to dine at infamous Governors Ball, where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu. The chain’s managing director of corporate buying, Tony Baines, said: ‘At Aldi our shoppers love to try out lots of specialist products, and Wagyu is no exception. Following the frenzy around the Wagyu steaks Aldi sold last summer, we wanted to offer something new that would excite our customers. Following his Oscar success, Eddie Redmayne dined at the Governors Ball where Mini American Wagyu Burgers served with Aged Cheddar were on the menu . ‘Aldi’s Specially Selected Wagyu Burgers are made from premium quality Wagyu beef, and are available at an everyday low price, which our customers have come to know and love.’ At the Dorchester Bar, the £29 Wagyu burger is served with tomato relish and truffle mayonnaise. Aldi suggests teaming its version with its Specially Selected Brioche Burger Buns, which are 99p for four, and a pack of Roquefort cheese, which is £2.29. That would give a price for the Aldi version of less than £4 – assuming you only need a few slices of the cheese.

Tara Costigan, whose body was found on the laundry floor of a Calwell home in Canberra on Saturday, leaves behind two sons aged 11 and nine, and a newborn girl only one week old. Nearly $75,00 had been raised for the 28-year-old's children by Wednesday afternoon, only two days after the Go Fund Me page was created by her high school friend Emma Luke. Tara Costigan, who was murdered on Saturday, leaves behind three children including a one-week-old daughter . Over $70,000 had been raised for the 28-year-old's children by Wednesday afternoon, only two days after the Go Fund Me page was created by her high school friend Emma Luke . 'Everybody's touched by it. She has so many friends and other people who just want to help her kids at this time. Her family is massive as well, so lots of support for them,' Ms Luke told Fairfax. Ms Costigan's cousin, Nathan Costigan, confirmed that 'all of the money raised would be forwarded to the three children whose safety and wellbeing he said were the family's first priority right now'. 'A HUGE thank you to Emma Luke who started the gofundme page for the children. I can confirm it is legit, and I am meeting my local member Nicole Lawder MLA to source legal advice and a solicitor for the kids to ensure they receive every cent,' Mr Costigan said on Tuesday. While more than 1,400 people have submitted donations on the page, hundreds more have offered clothing and toys after being touched by the tragedy. 'I am donating today because if my wife and I were to pass I would want to know that my little ones were looked after too. No one should have to grow up without their parents but should that happen its nice to know that society has your back,' one donor wrote. Ms Costigan's cousin, Nathan Costigan, confirmed that all of the money raised would be forwarded to the three children whose safety and wellbeing he said were the family's first priority' On Monday, Ms Costigan's former partner Marcus Rappel, 40, (pictured) fronted the ACT Magistrates Court where he was charged with her murder . 'I'm not in a position where I can donate money but I do have size 000 and 00 baby girls clothing I would happily donate if you are in need of them. Please contact me and I'll post to you. Thoughts are with all Tara's family and friends,' another wrote. A fundraising walk has also been organised by the Canberra Mums Exercise Group, which Ms Costigan was a member of, for March 22. 'Tara Costigan, was murdered over the weekend. To honour her life, raise funds for her three children that are now tragically without their mother, and to stand up against domestic violence, we would like as many of you as possible to participate in the fundraising walk,' the event's organisers said.

Article text: It claimed the lives of four family members and has left his brother bedbound. Now, the cruel disease that has gripped several generations of Chris Graham's family has struck again. Mr Graham himself was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. The ex-serviceman, now 39, discovered in 2010 that he carries the same faulty gene that claimed the lives of his father, aunt, cousin and granddad, all in their 40s. This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony, bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube. Scroll down for video . Chris Graham was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease at just 34. Several members of his family have been killed by the cruel, genetic form of the condition . Like his brother, Mr Graham carries a faulty version of PSEN-1 gene, which affects around 400 families worldwide. The father-of-three, from Carterton in Oxfordshire, is experiencing mild memory problems, but knows it is a case of when, not if, his dementia progresses. Although he is young, the disease process will affect him in the same way as the estimated 500,000 people with Alzheimer's in the UK. Mr Graham, who was medically discharged from the Army in January after 23 years' service, said: 'My friends didn't believe me when I told them I had Alzheimer's disease. 'At the age of 39, it just doesn't make sense to people: I'm fighting fit – how can I have something like that? We still think of Alzheimer's as a bit of forgetfulness as we get older. The truth is far worse.' He continued: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time. 'His sister, my aunt Thelma, died at 41 as she inherited the faulty gene too. I also lost a cousin, Thelma's daughter, at 41, and a granddad, Dad's father, at 46 to the disease.' This rare, inherited, or 'familial' form of Alzheimer's disease has also left his 43-year-old brother, Tony (pictured with his son), bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube . The disease also claimed the life of Mr Graham's father. He said: 'My family has been hit hard by Alzheimer's. Dad died aged 42. He was in hospital so long I don't really remember him, I was only six or seven at the time' As one of four children, each of Mr Graham and his siblings had a 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene from their father. While his two sisters avoided the genetic curse, tragically, both he and his brother Tony have been struck by it. Speaking about his brother, who was diagnosed in 2006, said: 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes.' Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for killing brain cells and shrinking the brain 400 per cent faster than the normal rate of ageing. Mr Graham is now taking part in research studies at University College London's Institute of Neurology to help scientists understand the earliest signs of Alzheimer's to boost the search for new treatments. He said: 'Although I know what will happen to me in the coming years, I now have direction in life. 'I wanted to do something to fight back against the disease – to do as much as I can while I can. It's simple for me, you have to hit the enemy directly, so I've taken on a challenge to help support research and I'm taking part in studies.' Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April. His year-long challenge has earned the support of Prime Minister David Cameron, who praised Mr Graham's 'extraordinary grit and determination' to raise money for the charity. Mr Graham said of his brother (pictured right with his own children): 'He's in an old folk's home, he can't move and has to be fed through a tube. He can't speak but can raise a smile sometimes'. Tony is pictured with his partner Jane . Now, to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for Alzheimer's Research UK, Mr Graham is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around Canada and America in April . Mr Graham, who is also supporting ABF The Soldiers' Charity through his cycle ride, said: 'It's going to take me a year to do it, but I hope giving one of my good years to this challenge will help give many more good years to people with dementia. 'A cure may come too late for me, but it will help my kids. We've got man to the moon, so we'll get to the answers if we put enough into it. I hope what I'm doing will help inspire people to support Alzheimer's Research UK.' He is sharing his story in the same week a YouGov survey commissioned by Alzheimer's Research UK. Early onset Alzheimer's tends to cluster within families, sometimes with several generations affected, in which case it is called familial disease. In some of these cases, it is caused by mutations in one of three genes. People with any of these extremely rare mutations tend to develop Alzheimer's disease in their 30s or 40s. These genes, and the prevalence of their defective versions  is as follows: . These mutations are extremely rare and account for fewer than one in 1,000 cases of Alzheimer's disease. It is likely that all of those who inherit faulty versions of any of these three genes will develop Alzheimer's disease at a comparatively early age. On average, half of the children of a person with one of these rare genetic mutations will inherit the disease. People who do not inherit the mutation cannot pass it on. Someone who has two or more close relatives (a parent, brother or sister) who developed Alzheimer's disease before the age of 60, is advised to ask their GP about genetic testing and counselling for these rare mutations, who can also refer patients to a geneticist, if appropriate. Source: Alzheimer's Society . This revealed that, when asked what they think dementia is and who it affects, just 23 per cent of British adults specifically mentioned brain disease or degeneration, despite a previous survey from the charity showing more than one in three people know a close friend or family member with the condition. Hilary Evans, Director at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'Chris embodies everything that goes against the dementia stereotype – he's young and fit and his zest for life in the face of adversity is truly inspiring. 'Although Chris' form of Alzheimer's is rare, the tragic consequences it has had on his relatives will resonate with thousands of families across the UK who have experienced Alzheimer's. 'Chris' situation shows how profound the impact of Alzheimer's can be – this is not forgetfulness in old age, the disease is a destructive process that takes the ultimate toll. 'Our new survey data shows we have a long way to go in dementia education. We need to recognise the physical process of Alzheimer's – in doing so we'll see that there's something real we can attack and overcome with research. 'Until we do, our own misunderstanding or prejudice risks becoming the biggest barrier to research. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'Alzheimer's is one of the key health challenges of this generation. 'Chris has my absolute backing as he undertakes this mammoth challenge in aid of Alzheimer's Research UK and ABF The Soldiers' Charity. 'Travelling unsupported on an expedition which will see him cycle 16,000 miles around the coastline of North America, Chris is a great example of someone who, when faced with a difficult diagnosis, has shown extraordinary grit and determination to overcome his circumstances and ensure that future generations can benefit from potentially life-saving research. 'These are important causes, and I urge everyone to get involved and support Chris as he sets off on this daunting, once-in-a-lifetime journey.'

Article text: A Philadelphia man has been charged with stabbing a member of Nikki Minaj's tour crew to death during an argument over a barmaid. Pierce Boykin was charged with the murder of 29-year-old De'Von Pickett on Tuesday, Homicide Captain James Clark confirmed. Pickett - who was Minaj's tour manager - was stabbed to death in the early hours of Wednesday, February 18, outside a bar in Philadelphia. Charged: Pierce Boykin, 31, (left) was charged with the murder and attempted member of members of Nicki Minaj's (right) tour crew - who had arrived in Philadelphia for rehearsals for the singer's upcoming tour . He and the rest of the crew had just arrived in the city to rehearse for Minaj's tour, which is supposed to begin in Europe this month. Fellow crew member Eric Parker, 27, was also stabbed in the attack, but was expected to survive his injuries. Boykin, 31, was originally charged with attempted murder of Parker, but Clark says the murder charge was tacked on after additional evidence pointed to Boykin for both stabbings. According to NBC 10, the argument began inside Che Bar & Grill in Philadelphia’s West Oak Lane neighborhood. 'We believe that both of the victims, as well as the perpetrator, were all inside of this bar and that’s when an argument started,' said Chief inspector Scott Small. Boykin is in custody, and an attorney for him could not be reached to comment on the charges.

Article text: An eight-year-old schoolboy who dressed as a character from Fifty Shades of Grey for World Book Day was laughed at by teachers, while a second school child was told he couldn't take part for wearing the same costume. Cole Froom pulled on one of his father's suits and arrived at Lakes Primary School in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, dressed as Christian Grey - where staff found his costume 'funny'. However, in Manchester, Liam Scholes was 'excluded' from lessons after teachers at Sale High School branded his outfit, inspired by actor Jamie Dornan, was inappropriate. The 11-year-old pupil was dressed in a shiny grey suit, equipped with cable ties and a face mask. Scroll down for video . Cole Froom, eight, (left) in his version of character Christian Grey from Fifty Shades of Grey. Jamie Dornan, (right), played the character in the recent blockbuster hit . But Cole's 28-year-old mother, Joanne Dickinson, was surprised when she heard Liam Scholes had been disciplined for the outfit, after her son's teacher reacted by laughing. She said: 'I took him into the classroom and his teacher asked who he was and he said Christian Grey and the teacher just started laughing. 'Some of the kids had never heard of him so not many knew who he was dressed as but those who did thought it was funny'. Miss Dickinson, who has an older daughter, Caitlyn, 10, and a 12-month-old baby called Harrison, said the Year 4 pupil came up with the outfit idea himself. 'He was asking on Wednesday about what he could go as for World Book Day. I'd done some researching and couldn't come up with anything. 'Then he suggested going as Christian Grey himself. He'd seen that I had the book and heard me go on about seeing the film. 'He hasn't read the book or seen the film but there are adverts on in the day and he's asked about it. But he thinks it's about a rich man that owns a big house and a helicopter.' Cole (left) pictured with his mother, Joanne Dickinson (centre), sister Caitlyn, 10, (right) and 12-month-old baby brother Harrison (in Miss Dickinson's arms) Cole asked his father, Stuart Froom, who is separated from Miss Dickinson, if he could borrow one of his suits. After some persuasion the 35-year-old carer allowed him to wear his black shirt, grey tie and grey trousers. 'His dad popped in between his work hours with the outfit, but did say he didn't think it was a good idea, but we went ahead with it anyway. 'Most of the parents at the school thought it was funny. One or two have made little digs saying he shouldn't know what that is - but he doesn't know what it is.' Father Stuart Froom (centre) let Cole (right) borrow one of his shirts and ties to go as Christian Grey for World Book Day on Thursday. Sister Caitlyn, who is in Year 6, didn't get to dress up for the event . Caitlin, 10, (left) with Cole (right) and their baby brother Harrison (centre). When Cole arrived at school his teacher, dressed as Harry Potter, found the outfit funny . The full-time mother said she 'couldn't understand' why staff at Sale High School had taken such drastic action over the costume. She said: 'I thought it went a bit far. I was half-expecting one of my son's teachers to pull me up on it today but they didn't.' Children around the country were encouraged to go to school dressed as literary characters on Thursday as part of the global event. The Fifty Shades Of Grey novels by E L James series have sold more than 100million copies and tell the story of the relationship between a college student and a wealthy businessman. They are notorious for their explicit scenes featuring sex acts and bondage, which some campaigners claim promotes domestic abuse. Liam Scholes (pictured) was told off by teachers after turning up to school dressed as Christian Grey - complete with cable ties and a sleeping mask . Liam, pictured, was told he couldn't appear in his class photo wearing the outfit from the controversial movie . Cole's experience was completely different to Liam Scholes from Sale High School in Manchester who also arrived in class dressed as Christian Grey from the novel. Teachers objected when the youngster appeared with cable ties and an eye mask which were both props from the controversial book. Staff then rang Liam's mother Nicola, who herself is a primary school teacher, to tell her that the outfit was inappropriate. She said: 'We thought it was funny. We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey. 'At first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea. 'He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties. The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. We didn't think there would be a problem. 'I got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs.' Among the more traditional Oliver Twists, Burglar Bills and Where's Wallys, schools around Britain welcomed some more unusual 'literary' characters yesterday. Jamie Peek, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, surprised his friends at Woods Loke primary by turning up as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. His mother, Caroline, said: 'He's mad about cars and a massive Top Gear fan so he told me he wanted to go as Jeremy Clarkson.' Jamie Peek from Lowestoft, Suffolk went to World Book Day as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson . Mrs Peek added: 'It was a bit of a strange costume to pull together but I got a wig from eBay and trimmed it to look right. Most of the clothes are his own. He even impersonated Jeremy Clarkson's grumpy faced Twitter profile picture for the class photo. 'He's got a number of Top Gear annuals and books. I think it's good for his reading.' Parents around the country were divided over whether superheroes more famous for films than books, such as Ironman and Spiderman, count as literary characters. But the biggest debate on Twitter centred around the army of girls dressed up as Princess Elsa and Princess Anna from Disney's Frozen seen turning up at schools. Benjamin Johncock tweeted: 'A little girl is dressed up as Elsa from Frozen. I want to shout at her, THAT’S NOT A BOOK' Hundreds of girls around the UK arrived dressed as Princess Elsa from Frozen, though some parents questioned whether the Disney characters is truly literary . Claire Anderson added: 'My daughter is VERY unimpressed by the 23(!!) girls dressed up in Frozen costumes for #WorldBookDay at school' A website user called saraurora added: 'The boy dressed as an oompa-loompa in a sea of Elsa's and superheroes is my idol' Others insisted Frozen now has plenty of follow-up books based on the film and is an adapted version the classic Snow Queen tale. Atticus Beaterband replied: 'Frozen is a riff on the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen so technically it maybe could sneak in under the bar?'

Article text: A transgender woman who believes she was unexpectedly the focus of a Planet Fitness policy controversy said that she has only used the gym’s female locker room on two occasions. Carlotta Sklodowska came forward today after Michigan mom Yvette Cormier made headlines for having her gym membership instantly revoked when she complained about a transgender woman using the female locker room. Sklodowska now claims that she believes she is the transgender woman Cormier saw and that she had only used the changing area on two separate visits to hang her purse and coat and to pick up her items after working out. Speaking out: Carlotta Sklodowska says she believes that she is the transgender woman Yvette Cormier saw in the Midland, Michigan, Planet Fitness . Working out: Sklodowska said she was only at the gym on two occasions when using a friend's guest pass. She said she only used the locker room to hang her purse and coat while working out . Cormier, 48, had complained to the Planet Fitness staff in Midland last Saturday when she noticed ‘there was a man’ in the changing room. The staff informed her that the person was transsexual and was allowed to be in the locker room, and when Cormier continued to complain, the gym canceled her membership for violating its ‘no judgement zone’ policy. Sklodowska told MLive that she’s not a member of the gym and was there using a friend’s guest pass. She added that she asked the gym staff about policy surrounding transgender individuals before she entered the locker room. ‘You can use the locker room that corresponds with how you are dressed,’ she said the staff member told her. Membership revoked: Yvette Cormier was kicked out of her gym in Midland, Michigan, after complaining about a transgender woman in the female locker room . 'I was stunned and shocked,' Cormier told WNEM about the incident. 'He looked like a man. He did not look like a woman.' Cormier maintains she wasn't complaining because the person was transsexual, but because she thought there was a man in the women's room. 'This is very unprofessional,' she said. 'This is very scary.' Sklodowska said she wore leggings and a baggy T-shirt on both gym trips. She added that she understood why Cormier would see her body structure as masculine, because many people tell her she looks like a man. She said she uses women’s public restrooms regularly but no one has had any issues previously, and that she’s the only transgender woman she knows of in Midland, a city with a population of about 40,000. Friends showed Sklodowska the news story about the locker room policy, and that's when she assumed the story was about her. Changing room: This is a photo from the locker room at the Planet Fitness in Midland, Michigan. Gym staff told Sklodowska to 'use the locker room that corresponds with how you are dressed'. She wore leggings and a baggy T-shirt on both gym trips . Kicked out: Yvette Cormier is no longer allowed to go to Planet Fitness Midland for violating their 'no judgement zone' policies . But she said she did not observe anyone in the locker room who looked distressed. Planet Fitness have not budged on the stance they took with Cormier. The gym says that Cormier has been talking about the incident with other people at the gym and she has been inappropriate. 'Planet Fitness is committed to creating a non-intimidating, welcoming environment for our members,' the gym said in a statement. 'Our gender identity non-discrimination policy states that members and guests may use all gym facilities based on their sincere self-reported gender identity. Misconceptions: Sklodowska said she understands why  Cormier (pictured) believed see her body structure as masculine, because many people tell her she looks like a man . 'In expressing her concerns about the policy, the member in question exhibited behavior that club management deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members, which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was canceled.' Planet Fitness Director of Public Relations McCall Gosselin told ABC News that Cormier handled the situation poorly. 'As our statement outlines, her membership was not cancelled as a result of complaints about our policy, as we welcome all feedback from our members,' Gosselin told ABC. 'Rather, it was the manner in which her concerns were expressed that club management felt was inappropriate, which resulted in the cancellation.' Midland isn’t a very welcoming community for transgendered women, Sklodowska said, but she has found a supportive group of friends. ‘I have loads of friends around town,’ she told MLive. ‘They are all straight ladies. We have wonderful times together.’

Article text: Eight competitive rounds to the Masters and Rory McIlroy is determined to get back on track after the rude awakening of a rare missed cut at the Honda Classic last week. ‘Sometimes a kick up the backside can do you a world of good, and I want to do well in these next two events,’ said the world No 1, who will tee off alongside world No 2 Bubba Watson and No 3 Henrik Stenson in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday. The 25-year-old took advantage of some unexpected time off to take his mum Rosie out for a birthday treat last Friday night before getting down to some serious hard practice over the weekend. Rory McIlroy was back in action during a practice round ahead of the WGC-Cadillac Championship . World No 1 has this event and the Arnold Palmer Invitational to hone his game for the Masters . McIlroy only has The Masters left to complete a full set of golf's grand slam titles . ‘I guess coming off a three-week break you’re never quite sure how your game is going to be, and I just wasn’t comfortable playing the shots I needed to play in the wind,’ said McIlroy. ‘Now I’m excited to get back at it and obviously put in a better performance. I’ve worked on those wind shots and I feel in a better place and probably a little more prepared than I was last week.’ On Monday, McIlroy turned up at the renowned Seminole club in south Florida for their fabled member-guest event. He walked through the locker room and studied the names on the winner’s board. Men with names like Snead and Hogan. Nicklaus, Palmer and Woods. ‘It would be cool to have my name up there,’ he thought to himself and well, you can probably guess what happened next. The four-time major champion breezed round in 63 and won by two strokes. The Norther Irishman gets lost among the azaleas while playing the Masters last season . McIlroy got a 'kick up the backside' by missing the cut at the Honda Classic in Florida . Now it is the first World Golf Championship event of the season featuring every single member of the world’s top 50. ‘I don’t know whether it’s important for me to be going to the Masters at the top of my form,’ said McIlroy. ‘I’ve won majors when not playing well leading up to them. But I know one thing for sure. I’d much rather be going there with a win or a good performance under my belt.’ When he has finished here, McIlroy will head up to Augusta with his dad Gerry before playing his final competitive event ahead of his first tilt at a career grand slam. That event will be at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. McIlroy was not the only one to leave West Palm Beach last week determined to make amends here. How about Ian Poulter, who bossed a good field in terms of shotmaking but squandered a golden opportunity to claim his first strokeplay triumph on American soil? Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter announces he will be hosting the British Masters in October . The British Masters will be staged at Woburn Golf Club in association with Sky Sports . Poulter put no fewer than five balls into the water during his final round to miss out on the sudden death play-off by a stroke. Now he finds himself on a course laden with so many water hazards it is known as the Blue Monster. Any prospect of a watery hangover, therefore? The ever-confident one gave short shrift to the notion. ‘Do you think I will have suddenly developed a phobia for water?’ he asked, aghast. ‘Come on. I’m holding a bottle of water for heaven’s sake! ‘Honestly, I couldn’t care less there’s water everywhere. This is a course where you’ve got to hit your targets and yes, if you miss them and hit bad shots then chances are that your ball is going to finish up wet. ‘But I’m going into this tournament having led the field last week in greens in regulation and shots that finished closest to the hole. ‘Yes, it’s a tournament I should have won and I’m devastated in some ways that I didn’t. But I haven’t spent the time since wallowing on the sofa or worrying about the three or four loose shots that cost me. Poulter found the water no less than five times as he missed out on a play off at the Honda Classic . Poulter insists he has put the slump behind him and is fitter than ever heading into the WGC at Doral . ‘Time to move on and enjoy the fact I’m fitter than I’ve been for some time. I did some tests last week and the strength in my shoulder area is 75 per cent greater than last year, when I was struggling with injuries. No, it doesn’t mean I’m going to hit the ball 75 per cent further but it does mean I’m going to be able to cope better with the rigours of a long season and be able to hit the number of practice balls on the range that I want to.’ Poulter was speaking at the official announcement that he will be the host when the British Masters, with Sky Sports as presenting sponsor, is relaunched in October. If that welcome development sounds familiar, it is because Sportsmail broke the news last November. As we revealed back then, Poulter will be followed in future years as host by Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald.

Article text: Wales captain Ashley Williams says summer holidays for the squad have been put on hold as qualifying for Euro 2016 takes precedence over visiting exotic hot-spots. Chris Coleman's Group B leaders host Belgium for their next qualifier but the June 12 fixture at the Cardiff City Stadium causes problems as far as preparation is concerned. The fixture comes nearly three weeks after the conclusion of the Premier League season and almost a full six weeks from the final match of the regular Championship campaign, which could mean an extended break for the likes of Reading pair Chris Gunter and Hal Robson-Kanu. Ashley Williams (right, with Gareth Bale) was in impressive form during Wales' win in Israel on Saturday . The Dragons currently sit top of Group B after their 3-0 impressive victory in Haifa, Israel . Gareth Bale (right) celebrates his first and Wales' second goal of the evening with team-mate Chris Gunter . Wales boss Coleman is still undecided whether to go ahead with a planned Cardiff friendly against Northern Ireland on June 4 or have a long training camp before the Belgium game. But Williams says that whatever the decision, Wales will not be taking their eye off the ball following the 3-0 victory in Israel on Saturday night, a win which gave the nation its longest unbeaten start to a qualifying campaign since the 1976 European Championships. 'There was a big wait for this game and it will be the same for the Belgium game in June,' Williams said. 'When the season ends we will get focused again and keep the ball rolling. Williams has his heart set on helping Wales qualify for their first ever European Championship finals . 'We have not spoken about that break yet and I don't know what they are going to do with us. 'But everyone understands the importance of that game and no-one is going to be in Vegas or Miami before. 'We will have a rest and keep ourselves fit.' Wales will lose top spot in the group on Tuesday night should the delayed Israel-Belgium game in Jerusalem produce a winner - the fixture postponed last September because of the political situation in the Middle East. Chris Coleman's men reached their target of being in the top three teams at the halfway mark of qualifying . But Coleman said Wales have met their pre-group target of being in the top three at the halfway stage of the qualifying campaign and, with seven or eight points potentially enough to claim one of the two automatic qualifying places for France 2016, three of their last five games are now at home. 'We have a massive game in June,' Williams said after winning his 50th cap against Israel in Haifa. 'A win over Belgium will be a big step to where we have to go. 'There is still a lot of football to be played after that so I wouldn't go as far as to say that we win that and we are there. 'We do know that a win over Belgium will make a big difference. 'We understood how big the Israel game was but there is another massive game in June which will be even more important. '

Article text: A boy who was just 11 when he was charged with fatally shooting his father's pregnant fiancee has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new  trial. Jordan Brown, now 17, was jailed in 2012 for the fatal shooting of 26-year-old Kenzie Houk and her unborn son with a shotgun in February 2009 because he was jealous that the child would be given his room. The court heard Houk, then eight months pregnant, was sleeping when Brown approached her with a blanket-covered 20-gauge shotgun and fired a bullet into her head. However, Brown's attorneys claim the evidence used to convict him was insubstantial and he was the victim of a rush judgement. 'Rush judgement': Jordan Brown (pictured left aged 14), was convicted of shooting his father's fiancee Keznie Houk (right) when she was eight months pregnant and sleeping. He claims the evidence was insubstantial . Shock: His father Chris Brown (pictured) spoke out about his shock after the attack when the boy was just 11 . Filing for retrial on Thursday, defense attorney Steve Colafella said: 'I think the trial court has, at a minimum, no choice but to give us a new trial. 'We feel strongly there was just not enough evidence to convict him beyond reasonable doubt and are confident of an acquittal.' The state Supreme Court first raised questions about the case in December. Jordan Brown's defense attorneys said both sides were asked to file written arguments before the judge issues a final ruling in a few weeks and that they expect a favorable ruling. State prosecutors did not immediately comment following the closed hearing in Lawrence County. State police and prosecutors have repeatedly said none of the evidence points to anyone but Brown, who is now 17. The defense contends the investigation amounted to a rush to judgment against the boy, fueled in part by Houk's family. They have told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who, they contend, was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse in Wampum, about 40 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. Tragic: Houk left behind a seven-year-old Jenessa (left) and a four-year-old Adalynn (right) Brown's defense lawyers claim Houk's family fueled animosity towards Brown during the 2012 trial . Brown's attorneys claim he was the victim of a rush judgement . Prosecutors contend Brown approached Houk with his youth-model 20-gauge shotgun hidden under a blanket then shot her in the back of the head as she lay in bed. She was more than 8 months pregnant with a son, who also died. Brown's father had left for work and Houk's two daughters, ages 7 and 4, were the only others in the house when she was shot, prosecutors said. An empty shotgun shell was found on the long driveway between the house and the road, where Brown walked before a school bus picked him up that morning, and police said they found gunshot residue on his clothes and no male footprints leading to or from the house except for Brown's. But Colafella said pictures from the scene show a 'muddy mess' outside the house that doesn't clearly show what footprints were and were not there and that police did not thoroughly canvass four entrances to the home to see whether someone else could have come in. 'Jealousy': Jordan was allegedly jealous that his father's new son was going to be named Chris after him . The defense also said Brown frequently shot his gun and that gun powder residue found on his clothes that day could have come from a winter jacket he had also worn during a turkey shoot days earlier. Police have said Houk's ex-boyfriend was eliminated as a suspect by their investigation, but the Supreme Court noted defense arguments that Jordan saw a truck resembling the man's near the house that morning. Colafella also said Houk's seven-year-old daughter first told police she didn't hear anything unusual that morning, only to later recall hearing a loud bang after additional questioning. Houk's body was found after the four-year-old went outside to tell men hired to cut trees that she thought her mother was dead, police said. Jack Houk, the dead woman's father, did not immediately return a call seeking comment after the hearing. The defense has told investigators and reporters that the boy was spoiled by his father and jealous of Houk and her unborn child who they contend was going to be given Jordan's room in his father's farmhouse .

Article text: The first video of Mohammed Emwazi - identified last week as ISIS executioner Jihadi John - has emerged . The first footage of ISIS executioner Jihadi John as a shy teenage schoolboy has emerged. The video shows Mohammed Emwazi, identified last week as the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria, being chosen by a classmate to join in with a game of lunchtime football. The previously-unseen footage was filmed 11 years ago at Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi was educated. The friendly kickabout is the first moving image to have been obtained of Emwazi before he became the ISIS's depraved executioner-in-chief. In the film, obtained by Channel 4 News, the 'football mad' teenager, thought to be around 15 at the time, is  the second person to be chosen for the team. One of his fellow pupils can be clearly heard shouting 'Emwazi', beckoning over the future jihadi. But he also appears to be painfully shy, instantly raising his arm to cover his face when he knew the camera was focusing on him. Channel 4 News said Emwazi had been identified in the video by two different people that he knew at the time. The footage, filmed in May 2004, was broadcast this evening, after it emerged that the executioner had dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother. According to a former friend of his brother Omar, Emwazi and two bearded associates abducted two gang members in 2008, while he was living on the notorious Mozart estate in west London. After viewing the footage, Diane Foley, the mother of American journalist James Foley, told Jon Snow it was 'frightening' that a 'promising young person who had many gifts' could use his talents for 'such evil'. She said: 'It's very frightening he would end up filled with such hate. That's very disturbing to me that young people would be attracted to such hate?' She added that the fact Jihadi John had been identified did not help to bring her closure. She said: 'If it had not been that young man, then I'm afraid it would have been someone else. I think it's tragic for that young man and his family - it's just so sad and we must do more to protect our young people from the lies that have instilled so much hate and brutality.' Since being identified, Emwazi has emerged as a fun-loving young boy, who adored The Simpsons, Playstation games and eating chips. He was also said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30. Scroll down for video . The video shows Emwazi, aged around 15, being chosen by a captain to join the team for a game of football . The footage, which is the first time any moving image has been obtained of Emwazi, was shot in the playground of Qunitin Kynaston Academy, the secondary school in Queen's Park . In a handwritten entry in his primary school yearbook, the Kuwaiti-born British citizen, who moved to the UK aged six, wrote: 'What I want to be when I grow up is a footballer'. The entries showed no sign he would go on to become the world's most wanted man, who is believed to have beheaded a string of hostages in the name of Islam. But, a decade later, Emwazi had shunned British life and was a 'known wolf' to MI5, having already taken the path towards becoming ISIS' most notorious murderer. In a chilling twist, in a school yearbook from when he was 10, Emwazi lists his favourite computer game as shooting game 'Duke Nukem: Time To Kill' and his favourite book as 'How To Kill A Monster' from the popular children's Goosebumps series. He also lists his favourite band as pop group S Club 7, and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30, writes: 'I will be in a football team and scoring a goal.' Emwazi also listed his favourite colour as blue, his favourite animal as a monkey, his favourite cartoon as The Simpsons and chips as his favourite food. Earlier this week, it emerged Emwazi was bullied as a schoolboy at the school in which the film was made. Emwazi, pictured as a schoolboy, was said to have wanted to become a Premier League star, scoring goals for Manchester United by the age of 30 . The terrorist has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab . Former headteacher Jo Shuter told Radio 4's Today programme: 'He had adolescent issues. Particularly at that age, for the boys, it is a time when the hormones start raging, and he had some issues with being bullied which we dealt with. 'By the time he got into the sixth-form he was, to all intents and purposes, a hard-working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted to go to.' After arriving in Britain when he was six years old, the  extremist appeared to embrace British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United. He had moved to Britain in 1993, settling in the north-west London suburbs of Maida Vale and Queens Park. Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class. He went to mosque with his family, who spoke Arabic to each other, but wore Western clothing and became popular with his British classmates at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London. The footage was filmed at Quintin Kynaston Academy School in St John's Wood, north London, where Emwazi attended secondary school and was said to have been bullied . He was also described as 'calm and decent' and 'the best employee we ever had' by  an IT firm for whom he worked in Kuwait. But, at some point during his lifetime, Emwazi was radicalised and was soon on the radar of MI5. It emerged today that the Home Office could face fresh questions over border controls after it is thought that Emwazi used a well-worn route to leave the UK. The 26-year-old a university graduate from Queen's Park, London, was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist and being monitored by Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command. He had been watched by the services since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab. Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain. En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab. Emwazi claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He alleged an agent from MI5 knew 'everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with' and claimed the organisation attempted to 'turn' him to work for them. By Arthur Martin for The Daily Mail . The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi . Jihadi John’s family are being guarded by armed police at a secret location in a security operation costing taxpayers more than £5,000 a day. Officers from Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command provide round-the-clock protection for the Islamic State killer’s mother, brother and three of his sisters. The family, who have milked the benefits system for 20 years, went into hiding when their son was identified as Mohammed Emwazi. They initially left their £600,000 London flat, where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby. But when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21, was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names. They have been receiving an estimated £40,000 a year in benefits since they sought asylum in Britain in 1993. The family fled Kuwait after the first Gulf War, claiming persecution as they were seen to favour the Iraqi invasion in 1990. But after they were made British citizens Emwazi’s father Jasem, 51, returned to Kuwait – the country he claimed he fled fearing for his life. His daughter Asma, 25, is also there. Meanwhile Emwazi’s mother Ghaneya, brother and three of his sisters continue to drain the public purse of thousands more in protection costs. None are suspected of wrongdoing but police are thought to be questioning them about their contact with Emwazi since he moved to Syria. Tory MP Philip Davies said the public will be angry that the family are receiving such expensive protection, but added that the police are in an ‘impossible position’. They initially left their £600,000 London flat (pictured) where their rent was paid by Westminster Council, and moved into a property nearby . Scotland Yard refused to comment on the family’s whereabouts or security arrangements. Friends of the family said Emwazi’s father moved close relatives into a safe house in Kuwait after his son’s identity was revealed. Last night a former friend of the terrorist said he once kidnapped two boys at gunpoint in retaliation for a gang attack on his brother. Emwazi forced the teenagers into a car and ordered them to strip to their underwear before dumping them on the M1 motorway. The kidnapping was said to be retribution for a vicious attack the previous day when Emwazi and his younger brother Omar were attacked with bricks. Then, when Emwazi’s brother, Omar, 21 (pictured) was spotted by a television crew the family were moved to a hotel where they are living under assumed names . It occurred in 2008 when Emwazi was studying at the University of Westminster – a year before he was quizzed by the security services on suspicion of trying to reach militant training camps in Somalia. The friend, who was 14 at the time, said the attack was sparked by gang rivalries involving two West London estates. ‘There was a big fight,’ he said. ‘[Gang members] threw a brick at my head and broke my arm. Omar was punched in the face a few times and beaten up. ‘The next day Mohammed turned up with two religious guys with beards. They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off. They dumped them on the M1.’

Article text: Do you dote treat your children to a gadget or give them money when they perform well at school? According to a study, such actions could be detrimental to their development, and cause them to be more materialistic as adults. The study suggests that those who were rewarded and spoiled as children were more likely to think possessions define who we are. A study by the University of Missouri and the University of Illinois at Chicago found gifts could affect development. Adults were more likely to think possessions define who we are (stock image shown) if they were showered with rewards when they were children . The study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research and conducted by researchers Dr Marsha Richins (University of Missouri) and Dr Lan Nguyen Chaplin (University of Illinois at Chicago). 'Using material possessions to express love or reward children for their achievements can backfire,' wrote the authors in the paper called Material Parenting. 'Loving and supportive parents can unintentionally foster materialism in their children despite their best efforts to steer them away from relying on material possessions to find happiness or to judge others.' Where you live could affect how big your shopping habit is, according to new research. US scientists have found that people who live in wealthy neighbourhoods are more likely to have materialistic values and poor spending habits. And they think that young people living in particularly rich urban areas are the worst offenders. San Francisco State University’s study is the first to show a connection between neighbourhood socioeconomic status and materialism. Dr Ryan Howell, Associate Professor of Psychology at the university, believes the reason for the link is because of ‘relative deprivation,’ which is the feeling someone gets when they believe they are less well-off than those around them. The authors surveyed 701 adults to measure the long-term impact of material parenting. They were asked to describe their current life situation and values, and also reported on a variety of childhood circumstances, their relationship with their parents, and the rewards and punishments they received during three critical ages of childhood . Results showed adults who had received more material rewards and punishments as children were more likely than others to use possessions to define and express who they are. And adults who received many material rewards as children were likely to continue rewarding themselves with material goods and defining themselves through their possessions. Parents should therefore be cautious about using material goods to express their love and reward their children for good behavior, warn the researchers. They say an overemphasis on material possessions during childhood can have long-lasting effects. It can pave 'the way for their children to grow up to be more likely than others to admire people with expensive possessions and judge success by the kinds of things people own,' the authors conclude.

Article text: HACK ATTACK: State Department computers were compromised by intruders thought to be working from inside Russia . The U.S. State Department, already beset with allegations that it hasn't kept a tight enough leash on its officials' email accounts, shut down some of its unclassified email servers on Friday in order to clear out what sources say was a rash of malware inserted by foreign hackers. Cybersecurity officials at State believe Russian hackers are to blame but described the breach of their networks only as 'activity of concern.' The State Department did its best to handle the problem quietly, making no announcement during the regular daily reporters' briefing on Friday and issuing a subdued statement 21 minutes before the end of the work day. ABC News reported that the cyber intrusion is one of the most serious in the agency's history. But State framed it as a 'planned outage' and a routine 'upgrade' to its digital security systems, blocking its employees from sending outside emails and shuttering their Web browsers for an unspecified stretch of time that could last for days. 'As a part of the Department of State's ongoing effort to ensure the integrity of our unclassified networks against cyber attacks,' spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement, 'the Department is implementing improvements to the security of its main unclassified network during a short, planned outage of some internet-linked systems.' 'The Department continues to closely monitor and respond to activity of concern on our unclassified network. Such activity is something we take very seriously.' NOTHING TO SEE HERE -- MOVE ALONG ... State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki downplayed the damage, saying that a 'planned outage' was in the works . MALWARE: Hackers inserted malicious code into nonclassified computers at the State Department, leaving tech experts no choice but to shut everything down and clean it up . 'There has been no compromise of any of the Department's classified systems, nor of our core financial, consular, and human resource systems,' Psaki claimed. 'The recent increase in news reports regarding cyber incidents reflects that the Department is among a growing list of public institutions and private industries facing an increasing number of sophisticated cyber threats.' This isn't the first such outage to hit America's diplomatic nerve center: The same kind of event happened once in November when the State Department carried out what it called an 'upgrade' following an October cyber attack. Two State Department employees told Daily Mail Online that they couldn't reach websites from their office computers during the dinner hour on Friday, and confirmed that no emails were going in or out other than interdepartmental messages. Hackers have run roughshod over computer servers in the executive branch of the U.S. government in recent years, targeting the White House on a regular basis. In October, following an outage covering much of the Executive Office of the President, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters it should 'not be particularly surprising' that 'there are many people around the world who would love to gain greater insight into the activities of the United States government by collecting information from the White House network.' Many did find it surprising, however, to hear Earnest acknowledge that the computer infrastructure of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is 'subject to daily cyberattacks, or at least efforts to infiltrate it.' The FBI, the NSA and the Secret Service were all involved in an investigation, with insiders telling news organizations that – as with Friday's State Department trouble – Russian hackers were the most likely suspects. In August 2014 a cybersecurity firm discovered that Russian hackers had stolen 1.2 billion user names and passwords in a series of Internet heists affecting 420,000 websites. And a months-long sustained cyber attack on JP Morgan Chase last summer also originated in Russia, security officials believe, and may have also targeted as many as nine other banks. COULD IT BE? Russia's government is still angry at the Obama administration for imposing tough eceonimc sanctions on the nation's oligarchs following President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea . At least 83 million bank accounts were affected, mostly belonging to consumers but includnig about 7 million commercial customers as well. Hackers got access to customers' names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. Saparately, the FBI offered a $3 million reward last month for information leading to the capture of a Russian hacker believed to be behind the electronic theft of $100 million from American bank accounts. Evgeniy Bogachev is accused of deploying a 'botnet' – a hijacked super-network of personal computers controlled remotely without the owners' knowledge – by spreading malicious software through spam emails. The FBI described Bogachev's technique last year as 'an extremely sophisticated type of malware designed specifically to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects.'

Article text: The transformation of India's bowlers at the World Cup has been 'wonderful to watch' and the reigning champions will have a great chance of reaching the final if 10 Australian wickets tumble on Thursday, says Virat Kohli. India's bowlers were hammered all over Australia between December and mid-February as the team lost their Test series 2-0 and failed to win a single match in the following Tri-series, which also featured England. However, fast bowlers Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma have upped their game considerably at the World Cup and have combined with the strong spinners to forge a potent attack. India vice captain Virat Kohli is confident India can upset Australia to reach the World Cup final . The renowned batsman pushes through the nets during practice ahead of Thursday's semi-final . With the help of several run-outs, the Indian bowlers have dismissed the opposition in all seven matches on their way to the semi-finals. Kohli, the leading light in the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up, said everyone was aware of the areas where improvement was required and he was pleased by the way the pacemen had responded. India's bowlers including Mohit Sharma (centre) have picked up their game after early struggles Down Under . India's Mohammed Shami (right) celebrates after taking a wicket in the quarter final defeat of Bangladesh . 'The way the bowlers have reacted and the way they have performed with the composure and the confidence and the aggression all together, it's been wonderful to watch,' he told Cricket Australia's website. 'So we expect the bowlers to step up if you want to beat quality sides in the world and the way they have done this in this World Cup has been commendable. 'We've played the right kind of cricket and the difference now is how our bowling attack has come into play in this World Cup taking 70 wickets in seven games. Umesh Yadav (centre) celebrates after taking another wicket against Bangladesh to reach the last four . New Zealand celebrate en route to beating Australia to reach the Cricket World Cup final . 'That's probably been the difference, and if we continue to do that we have a great chance come game day.' India have not beaten Australia in any format since they arrived Down Under in late November but Kohli thinks Thursday at the Sydney Cricket Ground is the perfect opportunity to break that cycle. 'There couldn't be a better time for us,' he said. 'It's an opportunity for us to do justice to the way we've played so far in Australia, and we haven't had the results.'

Article text: The tactics used by Tory chairman Grant Shapps to convince people to hand over cash so he could get them 'stinking, filthy rich' have been revealed. Mr Shapps, posing as his business guru alter-ego Michael Green, used online leaflets to boast of his wealth and status in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions. Using pictures of himself in his private plane and six-bedroom mansion, the future Tory minister offered his 'friends' the chance to learn how to make their fortune –as long as they handed him $197, worth £130. Scroll down for video . Mr Shapps used pictures of himself in his private plane with his son in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions . Mr Shapps said his wealth was 'hard-core' evidence of that he could help people get rich. The revelations come just days after Mr Shapps, 46, faced calls to quit after being forced to admit he had continued to offer get-rich-quick advice after becoming a Conservative MP despite vehement denials to the contrary. The Tory minister had insisted he had not had a second job since being elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in May 2005, but was later forced to admit he had 'screwed up' by denying the allegations 'over firmly'. It comes after a recording emerged from 2006, a year after he was elected to Parliament, capturing the MP selling self-help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a 'ton of cash'. The full extent of his toe-curling sales pitch was published in the Sunday Mirror today after pictures were published on the website Political Scrapbook. In it he offers punters the chance to buy his toolkit on 'How To Become Stinking RICH Online' for $197 – even though he claimed it was worth $100,000. The toolkit, he claimed, would make those who bought it '11 to 22 times more successful than the crowd as a result'. Mr Shapps boasted about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. Pictured in his sports car he wrote: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L' But he warned punters they would have to move fast because he had taken the 'difficult decision' to limit supply to just 250 copies, saying: 'I will delete the webpage and the mastercopy of this toolkit'. Mr Shapps offered his online kit to people throughout the UK and across the world from his HowToCorp business based in North West London. He wrote: 'Since owning an online business has enabled me to live in a $2m home... to drive 3 high-end luxury cars and to own and operate my own aircraft, I suppose a toolkit that exposes every secret used to build that kind of wealth should rightfully sell for say $100,000.' Mr Shapps boasts about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. The letter, published in 2004, featured Mr Shapps posing in his luxury sports car with the caption: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L (delivered Saturday July 24). It's one of the first dozen on the road here in the UK.' Tory chairman Grant Shapps faced calls to resign last week after admitting he had had a second job while working as an MP . But he revealed he and wife Belinda also own a 'wonderful Elan Turbo'. The car, he says, is 'complete with in-car DVD, SatNav and just about every other refinement you could imagine in a vehicle. Why it even has a fridge!' He also boasts about his lavish six-bedroom house in Hertfordshire and its new extension. Next to a picture of him sitting in a plane with his son, he writes: 'Everyone a hobby. Mine's flying. But buying and maintaining an aircraft (and this is my second machine) isn't cheap! 'But I just hate to rent... So I took out my pocket-book and bought a plane. That's me and my son in the cockpit. (One of us is a three-year-old with a passion for flying :)' Revelations about Mr Shapps' methods comes just days after he was branded a 'liar and a bully' for threatening a constituents with legal action for highlighting the fact he had a second job. Dean Archer, 50, said he had feared losing his family home after Mr Shapps warned he would take him to court over a Facebook post that mentioned his internet sales sideline as Michael Green. Despite the revelations David Cameron last week insisted he had full confidence in the Conservative party chairman. He said: 'Grant did have another job when he first became an MP and he declared that in the Register of Members' Interests which is what you are meant to do. 'But he obviously made a mistake by saying in some interviews that the work had stopped earlier than it had. He's put that right so I think we can put that behind him. He's doing a good job.'

Due a $4million roster bonus on Tuesday, the move was widely expected, but nevertheless drew an emotional statement on the popular defensive tackle's Twitter feed. 'I'm in a good place, he wrote. 'I have a great relationship with the Patriots organization.

'I will take my time, think things through, take into consideration many things, but mainly family and see where life goes from there,' 'But regardless remember I will always remain a New Englander a Patriot forever,' he added. After signing a three-year, $22.5m deal last year, Wilfork played 766 snaps last season, and he hinted that he will continue playing as there is 'lots of gas still left in the tank'. The move gives the Patriots $8.06m in cap space, but the parties could yet reach a new, reduced, agreement for Wilfork to remain in New England.

Article text: In 1988, when Arsene Wenger was getting in his stride as Monaco manager, he revealed in an interview with a local newspaper that he did a master's degree in economics because it gave him a 'way to understand what was going on around me'. The 65-year-old must now wrap his head around how Arsenal were eliminated from the Champions League in the last 16 for the fifth year running, despite a 2-0 win against his former club that left it 3-3 on aggregate. Wenger's return to Monaco was not as romantic as he would have liked as no banners were unfurled at the Stade Louis II and few pleasantries were exchanged during a match that saw Arsenal win the battle, but lose the war. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's return to his former club Monaco ended in a 2-0 win that saw his team go out 3-3 on aggregate .

Wenger leaves the pitch as Arsenal were dumped out of the Champions League last 16 by his former club Monaco . Read chief sports writer Martin Samuel's match report from the Stade Louis II . Arsenal's exit on away goals means Wenger must now  focus on qualifying for next year's competition and little can be made in mitigation for being denied a place in the quarter-finals by a team sitting fourth in Ligue 1. 'We have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years, but twice against the future winners,' Wenger said ahead of the match, though it would take some doing for Leonardo Jardim's Monaco to become the third eventual European champions to boot Arsenal out. Wenger is sure to analyse his team's exit and it was in that same interview with Monaco-Matin some 27 years ago that he revealed his habit for making sure he watches at least half an hour of football every evening, among other interests. 'I read a lot, all sorts of books because you have to be conversant in a larger and larger amount of things,' the then-Monaco manager  said in 1988. 'For example, I follow closely what is being released in the book store, be it in French, in German or in English. I take notes by hand. I do not know how to type. I have watched a lot of matches. 'This is part of continuing to grow [as a manager]. You take a step back from your football and you analyse the practices elsewhere. 'I have at least 250 [video cassettes]. Every evening, at home, I watch a game for about half an hour. Often, it is the opponent that we are about to play, sometimes, it is just for enjoyment. Bayern [Munich] vs Real [Madrid] for example.' Watching this match will not make for pleasant viewing for Wenger, however, as his first competitive return to a city famous for its casino and where one in three people are millionaires saw Arsenal leave empty-handed. Wenger got off to a flyer as Monaco manager, winning the Ligue 1 title in 1988 to put the lid on a fine first season .

Article text: The 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on ‘middle incomes’, David Cameron said yesterday – as he hinted at fresh action on the issue in next week’s Budget. The Prime Minister said it was wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was ‘only ever meant for the better off’. Mr Cameron announced last year that a future Conservative government would raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from £41,865 to £50,000 by 2020. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on ‘middle incomes’ as he hinted at fresh action in the upcoming Budget during a visit to The Green School For Girls in west London yesterday (above) The move is opposed by the Liberal Democrats, so cannot be brought in immediately. But Chancellor George Osborne is expected to set out the aspiration during next week’s Budget, including laying out the timetable for raising the threshold. Senior Tories are pushing for the first significant rise in the threshold to be made next year if the party wins the election. The number of people paying 40p tax has risen by about two million to five million since 2010, as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by Labour. In a speech at a school in West London yesterday, the Prime Minister yesterday pledged to start easing the pressure on middle class families. He said: ‘We will raise the threshold at which people start paying the 40p rate of tax. This rate was only ever meant for the better off. But over the years it’s dragged more and more people into its reach - police officers, teachers, people on middle incomes. ‘That’s why we will move that threshold to £50,000 – so more hardworking people can keep more of the money they earn.’ The Prime Minister made the comments during a visit to The Green School For Girls in west London (above) Mr Cameron (pictured during his trip to west London) also confirmed that the Tories will press ahead with plans to raise the starting threshold for paying income tax to £12,500 – an ambition shared by the Lib Dems . Despite the pledge, the number of people paying 40p tax is expected to rise, albeit at a slower rate. Many Tory MPs are pushing Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to go further and faster on the issue. Mr Cameron also confirmed that the Tories will press ahead with plans to raise the starting threshold for paying income tax to £12,500 – an ambition that is shared by the Lib Dems. The threshold is already due to rise to £10,500 next month, and Mr Osborne is expected to announce it will rise to £11,000 in the Budget. Mr Cameron said the move would be ‘a tax cut for 30 million people.’ He added: ‘It will take everyone on the Minimum Wage working 30 hours a week out of income tax altogether.'

Boro gained an early lead through Daniel Ayala before Sky Bet Championship top scorer Daryl Murphy drew the Tractor Boys level. Patrick Bamford rounds Bartosz Bialkowski  before scoring his side's third goal at the Riverside . Bamford reels away in celebration as he celebrates his goal against Ipswich Town in the lunchtime kick off . But Albert Adomah nudged Boro back into the lead before Bamford's brilliant brace. 'Patrick deserves those goals for his work rate and he showed great confidence in the way he took both of them,' said Karanka. 'It was massive to win, we needed a performance today and I thought we were brilliant against a good, strong team. Ipswich Town left-back Tyrone Mears runs with the ball as a tackle comes in from Adam Clayton . 'We've played against a very strong team who finished the game with four strikers and the main thing is that we're eight points ahead of them in seventh. 'To be eight points ahead of them is a good situation for us.' Boro's first two goals came from set plays, and the Spaniard added: 'We've been working on our set-pieces this week and it was brilliant how the first two goals came from them. 'We've put the points on the board in the early kick-off and that was important. 'Some of our performances of late have not been the best but today we did very well. Maybe some people expected us to be bad but we gave the perfect answer.' The scoreline arguably flattered Boro, who have won and lost three out of their last six games but went back to the top of the table before other fixtures on Saturday afternoon. Albert Adomah strikes for goal in the . Ipswich looked bright in the first half and hit the post with the score at 1-1. Town boss Mick McCarthy said: 'We worked on defending corners and conceded two goals from them. 'We were great in the first half and second half we were undone by a really good goal by Patrick Bamford, it's great play by him. 'I'll take responsibility after 3-1. I threw strikers on, we were all over the place and a bit of a shambles at the end. We're organised at corners normally and shouldn't concede. 'It looked a bit shambolic at the end as we pushed forward and I'll take responsibility for that. 'Automatic promotion is looking hard now, we're not going to win three more games than two or three teams between now and the end of the season.'

Article text: The Bali Nine duo could have their case delayed for months, after The Indonesian Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a Filipina drug courier scheduled to be shot at the same time. Indonesian courts have consistently said they will execute all 10 drug felons at the same time, while the review is expected to take months. The Supreme Court said a panel of judges would be appointed this week to review the case of Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, a process which can take up to three months, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . The Bali Nine duo (pictured) could have their case delayed for months, after The Indonesian Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a Filipina drug courier scheduled to be shot at the same time . The pair may be waiting months for their execution as the review of Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso could take up to three months . Veloso was sentenced to death in 2010 for attempting to smuggle 2.6 kilograms of heroin from Malaysia to Yogyakarta. She maintains she was deceived and did not know the drugs were in her luggage. The family of Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte are appealing for his life to be spared on account of him being diagnosed with schizophrenia. Nine of the ten drug felons set to be executed together have now launched legal proceedings. It comes after Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said all ten prisoners would face the firing squad simultaneously. 'We don't want one to have to wait for another's execution before his own. That will affect the convicts' psychological state,' he said. President Widodo (left) has adopted a hardline approach to drug smugglers . The Indonesian Governor-General has said the death row inmates will be executed 'simultaneously' Myuran Sukumaran, left, and Andrew Chan, right, will be put through an 'assimilation' process as they prepare to face the firing squad . Mr Prasetyo also claims the death row inmates will be put through an 'assimilation' process which he believes will help them mentally prepare for their death. 'They will be accompanied by religious figures until they're truly ready,' he said. The two men are currently being held in isolation cells where they are able talk to each other. Their interaction with other inmates is limited to one Nigerian who is also on death row. Prison authorities claim there's been no order to move Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran from 'Death Island' even though the appeals process may be lengthy. Although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan from the prison referred to as 'Death Island' President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores . The pair's lawyers will return to Jakarta court on Thursday to challenge President Widodo's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders. Their last appeal was adjourned until March 20 as the president's representative did not have the required legal documentation. Two weeks earlier, the Administrative Court dismissed their argument that President Widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation. The claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree. The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response. Ms Bishop has offered to cover the costs of life imprisonment for the condemned men, if their lives are spared .

Article text: ISIS has executed another nine men for allegedly being spies in an unknown location in the Middle East. Each man is forced to give interview before their murder in which they admit to spying on the terror group's location, movement and armament. All nine of them - blindfolded with hands bound behind their backs - are then escorted outside by masked terrorists who eventually instruct them to kneel and place handguns to their heads. They pull the triggers without hesitation, sending their victims jerking forward until their limp bodies hit the dusty ground. The masked ISIS commander who introduces the latest senseless propaganda video says the men 'were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah'. Scroll down for videos . Senseless: ISIS has released footage of nine men being executed for allegedly spying on the terrorists . Murder: The blindfolded and shackled men were led onto a bridge in an unknown location in the Middle East before being shot by masked extremists . Forced confessions? Before their deaths, each man claims responsibility for spying on ISIS, although it is unknown whether they are speaking under duress . Doomed: The men are eventually escorted out of the building - clad with Islamic State insignia - to their deaths . Graphic footage ultimately shows the deceased captives resting perfectly still in a shallow pool of blood. But the scenes in which the senseless murders take place come six minutes and 30 seconds after the start of the seven minute video. It begins with a bizarre setup of a masked ISIS commander sitting in a corporate office, flanked by two other soldiers. He say that Islamic State succeeded in arresting an entire 'cell' of spies who were tasked with monitoring their locations back to their commanding officer. The unnamed militant then claims three of the men who squealed on the others, adding: 'We took the investigation to a judge and after collecting evidence, they were sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah.' Each of the nine kidnapped men are then forced to give interviews before their impending doom - presumably under duress - in which they confess to being spies. Their nationalities and professions are as yet a mystery, but some of the men look visibly terrified as they speak in trembling Arabic. This is the second video of an Islamic State execution to surface this week following the equally brutal mass murder of eight 'informers'. Mastermind: The second gruesome execution video to surface this week begins with a masked fighter who says the men were 'sentenced to death for betraying the religion of Allah' Captured: The unnamed ISIS commander also claims that three of the alleged spies squealed on their comrades . Execution: After being escorted onto what appears to be a bridge by armed fighters, the blindfolded men are instructed to kneal . Terror: The gruesome video is the second to surface this week following the footage of eight other alleged spies being killed in a similar way on Thursday . In the video which emerged on Thursday, the terror group justified the killings as vengeance for the military operations against them in Syria and Iraq. The gruesome propaganda video cut from scenes of the men being killed to footage of people who ISIS claims were killed during Coalition attacks on its locations. Cutaways include footage of dead children underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and body bags. As with the latest video which features interviews with the doomed captives, it featured graphics which 'profiled' each of the men about to be murdered. The videos emerge amid claims that ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon against peshmerga fighters in Iraq. Kurdish authorties made the allegation following a suicide bomb attack involving a truck on January 23. Murdered: Militants claim the eight men were informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS . Revenge: The militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold . In a statement, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said the alleged chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul and the Syrian border. It was there Peshmerga forces who were trying to seize a ISIS supply line - and discovered '20 gas canisters' loaded onto the back of the truck involved. Video provided by the council showed the truck racing down a road with white smoke pouring out of it as it came under heavy fire from peshmerga fighters. It later showed a white, billowing cloud after the truck exploded and the remnants of it scattered across a road.

The 31-year-old, who fights in Texas on May 9 against Omar Figueroa, has declared himself bankrupt this week with debts of £419,888 after a courtroom showdown with his former promoter. Warren had claimed unsuccessfully for £1.8million in lost profits at the High Court in London last year after Burns joined Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom stable on March 11, 2013.

Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act. "We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years," reads the offer on Spirit's website. "It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going." Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. "You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked," wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis. Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture. "Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. We enjoy being different than other airlines," said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications. "When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.  But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. They get lots of attention," he added. "The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently." The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday. Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights. Based in Florida, Spirit Airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can. The airline's defense is simple: Pay for what you want on your flight, and don't pay for what you don't want. Airline plans $15 flights to Europe .

Article text: 'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' will be returned to the descendants of art dealer Paul Rosenberg, from whom it was taken by the Nazis . Germany has signed an agreement to return to its rightful owner an Henri Matisse painting that was seized under Nazi rule. Matisse's 'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' was part of a trove of artworks found in the apartment of late collector Cornelius Gurlitt. Experts say the painting was taken from art dealer Paul Rosenberg and rightfully belongs to his descendants. Culture Minister Monika Gruetters' office confirmed a report in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today that she signed the agreement. A similar agreement was signed last week for a painting by Max Liebermann. Both agreements must be approved by a Munich court handling Gurlitt's inheritance. A Swiss museum that accepted Gurlitt's bequest of his collection has promised to ensure any Nazi-looted pieces are returned to their Jewish owners' heirs. Around 250 artworks were found in Gurlitt's Salzburg property. Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern inherited the collection . Some 1,280 others found in Gurlitt's apartment in Munich. While some of the Munich works were already known, it was the first look for many at the art Gurlitt kept in the house he owned in Austria. It includes works by Breughel, Monet, Renoir and Picasso. Gurlitt inherited much of the art from his father, who in the 1930s helped the Nazis sell art they considered 'degenerate' to buyers outside of Germany for cash. Some of the works — including Impressionist and modern masterpieces — had been seized by the Nazis from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell. Gurlitt died in May last year at age 81, designating the Swiss museum as his sole heir.
