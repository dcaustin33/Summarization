Bentley, a white Shih Tzu, was so timid when first taken into vets' care he flinched whenever a human tried to touch him. A team of vets spent five hours shaving off the thick matted fur from his coat after he was dumped at the West Yorkshire Dog Rescue by an owner who 'couldn't bear to touch him.' Scroll down for video . Bentle was found covered in 2kg of matted, petrol-coated fur after being heartlessly abandoned by his former owner . But the neglected pet surprised rescue centre staff after a new family were able to turn him from terrified terrier to a bouncy fun-loving puppy. It was love at first sight for Matthew and Catherine Stroh, from Skipton, North Yorkshire who have now taken Bentley home - weeks before rescue centre staff believed the dog would be re-homed. Rescuer Kathy Trout said: 'He was flinching from the human hand - he suddenly seems to have brought himself round into trusting people again. The Shih Tzu is completely unrecognisable after vets shaved off his matted fur and his found happiness with a new family . Bentley has been rehomed after being abandoned and covered in 2kg of petrol covered matted fur, by the Stroh family from Long Preston, North Yorkshire: (L-R) Harvey (13) -  mother Catherine - father Matt and  Oliver, 10 with their other little dogs  Dexter (Lhasa Apso) and Daisy (Cavapoo) Vets had to sedate the dog to be able to shave off the mass of smelly, petrol-coated fur he arrived with . 'The surprising thing is that Bentley was so incredibly affectionate with the family, especially Matthew. When I took him on a few weeks ago he was so frightened and biting me - it was fear aggression. The neglected dog, pictured with Catherine Stroh, has been given a new lease of life with his new family . 'But he seems to adore these people and their children. He's gone from a mess of a dog and a shell of himself to a really confident, bouncy thing.' Accountant Matthew, 43, said Bentley settled right in with the family and even sits at the front window waiting to welcome new people to the house. 'He's a little daddy's boy. He seemed to take to us straight away. He was all over me. 'I'm thrilled we could give him a new home, especially after what he had been through. He's very happy a settled with us. 'He still seems very puppy like. The children love playing ball with him - he just wants attention and to be loved.' Matthew and wife Catherine, 45, have sons Harvey, 13, and 10-year-old Oliver, as well as three-year-old Lhasa Apso Dexter and Cavapoo Daisy, also three. Matthew added: 'He even sits at the window waiting for people to come to the door. 'He's come so far out of his shell - he's nothing like the dog in those horrible pictures of him all matted and covered in petrol.' Vets had spent hours shaving off the matted, petrol-coated fur when Bentley first arrived to the rescue centre. He then had to be sedated to allow them to put a jacket over his tiny body to keep him warm. Bentley the Shih Tzu arrived at a dog rescue centre in Meltham, West Yorkshire, with fur so matted vets spent five hours shaving two kilograms of it off . Bentley's condition was so dire when he arrived at the centre, owner Kathy Trout was reduced to tears . Rescuer Kathy Trout said she had been reduced to tears by his condition. 'His coat was so covered in petrol, she said, a drink of water may have poisoned him if any fur had got in his mouth,' she said. 'He came into our rescue from a member of the public. His fur was very, very long and matted like felt and all his legs were like tree trunks with chemical smelling fur. 'It looked like he was thick with oil, fuel or petrol. He really, really stank. When Bentley arrived at the centre, his previous owner could not touch him, said Mrs Trout. Petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog, who had never been groomed, gave off a strong stench . After spending time recovering at the centre, Bentley has overcome his fear of interaction with humans, and plays happily with the other dogs in its care . 'Cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs.' His owner, who arrived in a 'shiny 4x4' could not even bear to pick him up, she added. 'She handed him over on a lead because she wouldn't even touch him. It is clear he has never been groomed.' 'It's wonderful to see him so happy again,' she added. The dog would not allow any carers to remove a fleece jacket for weeks after they had put it on to keep him warm . Bentley has now fully recovered thanks to his loving new owner Catherine Stroh and her family, from North Yorkshire . Kathy Trout said caring for abandoned and abused dogs was a difficult job for which nothing can prepare you .

All article text:Moscow (CNN)Russia was ready to put its nuclear forces on alert over the crisis in Crimea last year, such was the threat to Russian people there, President Vladimir Putin said in a documentary that aired on state TV on Sunday night. Asked if Russia was prepared to bring its nuclear weapons into play, Putin said: "We were ready to do it. I talked with colleagues and told them that this (Crimea) is our historic territory, Russian people live there, they are in danger, we cannot leave them. "It wasn't us who committed a coup, it was the nationalists and people with extreme beliefs." But this was the worst-case scenario, he added, in the documentary broadcast on state-run channel Rossiya One. "I don't think this was actually anyone's wish -- to turn it into a world conflict." It wasn't known when the interview was originally taped. It aired even as speculation mounted about Putin's health, following an absence of several days from the public stage. He reappeared in public Monday. Russia formally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula last March, after Ukraine's pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted following street protests that turned bloody. Russia called his ouster a coup by radical Ukrainian nationalists. Before Crimea was formally absorbed by Russia, unidentified armed men had taken control of its administrative buildings and key military sites. A referendum was held on March 16, 2014 -- a year ago to the day -- on secession from Ukraine. Ukrainian officials at the time denied there was any threat to Russian citizens in Crimea. On Monday, Russia's Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said Putin had ordered Russia's Northern Fleet and other military units to be placed on full combat alert for snap checks, state media reported. "The main aim ... is to evaluate the capabilities of the Northern Fleet to fulfill tasks on ensuring Russia's military security in the Arctic," Shoigu is quoted as saying by Russia's Tass news agency. The exercise will involve 38,000 military personnel, 41 warships, 15 submarines and 110 planes and helicopters, Shoigu said, according to Tass. In the documentary, titled "Crimea: Way Back Home," Putin said Moscow had had no choice but to act. "Crimea isn't just any territory for us, it is historically Russian territory," he said. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula that has been part of Ukraine since 1954, has a majority Russian population and strong cultural and historical ties to Russia. It is also home to Russia's Black Sea fleet, at the Sevastopol naval base. But Putin said he had never thought of "dismembering" the peninsula from Ukraine until Yanukovych's ouster. "We cannot leave this area and the people who live there to whims of fate, to let the people of Crimea be thrown under the wheels of this nationalist bulldozer," he said. "I set certain tasks. I did say what and how we should do, but immediately stressed that we would do so only if we are absolutely convinced that the people who live in the Crimea want it." The vast majority of people who voted in the referendum approved secession from Ukraine. But the vote, staged while armed men controlled the region, was dismissed as illegal by Ukraine's then-interim government in Kiev, the European Union and the United States. The West responded with financial sanctions against selected Russian figures and Crimean secessionist leaders. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Berlin on Monday, reiterated that Europe does not consider Russia's annexation of Crimea to be legal. "It is important that we work for a peaceful solution, and we will not give up before the full sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has been restored," she said. "This not only includes Crimea but also now in our daily work the areas around Luhansk and Donetsk." Unrest broke out in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions following Russia's absorbing of Crimea. A fragile truce is currently in place but the conflict between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian forces there has claimed thousands of lives. Merkel warned that the European Union was ready to impose more sanctions if necessary against Russian interests to help ensure that a peace plan hammered out in Minsk, Belarus, last month is fully implemented. Putin told the documentary-makers he was certain the United States was behind the ouster of Yanukovych, which Moscow views as an illegal armed coup. "Formally, the opposition was primarily supported by Europeans, but we knew very well ... that the real puppeteers were our American partners and friends. It was them who helped prepare nationalists (and) combat troops," he said. He also said that sanctions should have been imposed against those who orchestrated what he called a coup, rather than those involved in Crimea's annexation. Putin insisted in remarks to reporters last month that there was no chance Crimea would be returned to Ukraine. And it appears Russia is taking no chances. In the documentary, Putin said Russia's Bastion high-precision coastal missile defense systems had been deployed to Crimea to protect the territory -- "in such a way that they were seen perfectly well from outer space." This can only be done following a decision by the supreme commander in chief, he said. "So, at a certain point, we deployed these coastal systems Bastion to make it clear that Crimea was under safe protection," he added. CNN's Alla Eshchenko and Emma Burrows reported from Moscow, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Leading 2-1 from the last 16 first leg in Turin, the visiting side nullified Dortmund's attacking threat to leave Bayern Munich as the Bundesliga's only remaining side in the competition, with the final to be played in Berlin on June 6. It was Dortmund's fourth loss in four European games against Juventus. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri had promised his side wouldn't sit back despite the first leg advantage. His players stayed true to his word and Tevez got the visitors off the mark with an effort that stunned the home fans. Juventus then pushed high up the pitch and snuffing out Dortmund's response before it could even begin. The home side harried and fought, yet was unable to trouble Gianluigi Buffon in goal. The veteran goalkeeper reacted quickly to extinguish the danger with Marco Reus lurking in the 36th but it was a rare intervention. Midfield marshal Paul Pogba had gone off injured before that, prompting a period of Dortmund pressure. The visitors were the only ones who created chances however, with Vidal firing over.

All article text:Former Scotland captain Dave Mackay, legendary enforcer of Tottenham’s 1961 double winning side, has died aged 80. In an age of hard men, the stockily built midfield man was one of the toughest, a symbol of passion and fiery commitment. For years the iconic picture of him angrily holding Leeds’ equally combative Billy Bremner was framed on the wall in the players’ lounge at White Hart Lane, the club’s spiritual leader long after he’d left. Dave Mackay confronts Billy Bremner during his Tottenham days in August 1966 . Mackay is crowned by  Jimmy Robertson (right) after Spurs beat Chelsea 2-1 in the 1967 FA Cup final . Mackay won the FA Cup with Tottenham three times, in 1961, 1962 and 1967 . Tottenham manager Bill Nicholson with players Cliff Jones, Jimmy Greaves, Mackay, Paul Shoemark and Stephen Pitt in 1965 . Mackay runs up the stairs at White Hart Lane as he fights his way back from a double leg fracture . But while that image summed up his enduring aggression and determination there was so much more to his game than just his daunting physical presence. Born in Edinburgh in 1934, he was the second in a family of four boys whose father worked for The Scotsman newspaper. He began his career with his boyhood idols Hearts, winning all three domestic honours before captaining the side in 1957-8 when they won the Scottish League title – setting a British record with 132 goals scored and only 29 conceded. That persuaded Spurs to buy him in 1959 for £32,000, a transfer that manager Bill Nicholson later claimed was his greatest ever signing. He created a powerful partnership with Danny Blanchflower, and together they provided the driving force in the side that became the first post-war team to achieve the double of League title and FA Cup. In all Mackay played 318 times for Tottenham, twice recovering from a broken left leg to captain the side that won the FA Cup in 1967. In a statement, Spurs said: 'Dave Mackay will certainly always be remembered here as one of our greatest ever players and a man who never failed to inspire those around him. 'In short, a Spurs legend.' Mackay challenges Manchester United's George Best during a game during the 1970s . Best again felt the full force of Mackay's boot as the pair battle for the ball in 1971 . The famous picture was taken on the first day of that season, when Mackay reacted to a tackle he believed was designed to deliberately injure his bad leg. He was a powerful personality, the leader off the field in the days when the players would congregate in the Bell and Hare pub after matches, as well as the leader on the pitch. When Brian Clough was forging the early days of his management career in 1968 he persuaded Spurs to sell him Mackay for a bargain £5,000 – and the Scot then became captain of the team that first won promotion to the old First Division, and then captured the League title in their first season in the top flight. Derby captain Mackay with the Watney Cup after their 4-1 victory over Manchester United . Mackay, who also played for Hearts and Swindon, was capped 22 times by Scotland . Mackay with former Derby manager Brian Clough and ex-chairman Lionel Pickering at the Baseball Ground in 2003 . Sir Bobby Charlton and Mackay chat as they pose for pictures of their special stamps in 2013 . He was jointly voted Footballer of the Year in 1969 alongside Tony Book, and played 122 games in all for Derby before ending his career as player-manager of Swindon. That began a management career which brought more success, starting out with Nottingham Forest and then peaking when in 1975, appointed as Derby’s manager following Clough’s resignation, he guided the club to the 1974-5 League title. Further jobs with Walsall, Doncaster and Birmingham brought less success, however, and his career ended taking jobs in Egypt and Qatar before he retired from football altogether in 1995. In later years he suffered from both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

All article text:Zafar Ansari and Mark Wood could be beneficiaries of the uncertainty around an England Test squad whose reputation has been left in tatters by the World Cup. Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes ahead of Wednesday’s naming of the party for a three-Test series against the West Indies that Peter Moores desperately needs to win if he is to remain England coach. Moeen and Woakes were injured towards the end of England’s disastrous World Cup campaign and are far from certain of being fit ahead of the first Test in Antigua on April 13 that follows two warm-up games in St Kitts. Zafar Ansari could be named as part of the England squad ahead of the three-Test series against West Indies . The 23-year-old is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey . The 23-year-old Zafar Ansari is an all-rounder who bowls left-arm orthodox spin and opens the batting for Surrey. IS HE ANY GOOD? Just ask Kevin Pietersen! So often a victim of left-arm spin, the former England batsman was dismissed by a 19-year-old Ansari as Cambridge University beat Surrey by 10 wickets in 2011. Ansari has 54 first-class wickets and a batting average of 30.16. ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW? Ansari would probably be among the smarter cricketers in England’s tour party, having studied politics at Cambridge. He admits he is often ribbed by his team-mates for having a crossword out in the dressing room. That means Surrey’s left-arm spin-bowling all-rounder Ansari and Durham pace bowler Wood could be named to travel with the squad as cover for Moeen and Woakes in the early days of the month-long tour. Ansari, 23, is predominantly a batsman and topped 1,000 championship runs last season but is perhaps the nearest equivalent to Moeen on the circuit. Wood impressed England’s outgoing fast bowling coach David Saker during a training camp in South Africa before Christmas and only fitness concerns have held the 25-year-old back from full international recognition. It seems certain that Jonathan Trott, now returned to full fitness after leaving England’s last Ashes tour with a condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety, will return after a successful tour of South Africa as Lions captain. England’s Test middle order is settled following the success of Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Ian Bell in the three successive victories over India last summer, leaving Trott to battle Sam Robson to become Alastair Cook’s opening partner. Mark Wood (centre) could also be included in England's test squad to face the West Indies . Question marks remain over the fitness of Moeen Ali (pictured) ahead of the Test series . Peter Moores desperately needs England to defeat the West Indies if he is to remain coach . Cook, sacked as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup, returns to action for MCC against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi starting on Sunday and will then seek to build on the progress made by England in Test cricket last summer. Jonny Bairstow, one of the casualties of the fall-out from the last Ashes, is favourite to tour as reserve wicketkeeper ahead of Kent’s exciting Sam Billings, while Adil Rashid and James Tredwell will compete for the other spin place. Rashid, a more mature performer than when he was thrust into the England squad prematurely in 2009, looked a certainty to tour until he bowled poorly for the Lions in South Africa and may now be pipped by the more reliable Tredwell. Such is the desperate state of English cricket after the World Cup that the pressure will be on not just Moores but also managing director Paul Downton when England take on a West Indies side who look sure to be weakened by the Indian Premier League. Chris Gayle, for one, is likely to retire from international cricket after the World Cup and West Indies should be even more vulnerable than England. Cook (Essex, capt), Robson (Middlesex), Ballance (Yorkshire), Bell (Warwickshire), Root (Yorkshire), Moeen (Worcestershire) or Ansari (Surrey), Buttler (Lancashire), Woakes (Warwickshire) or Wood (Durham), Jordan (Sussex), Broad (Nottinghamshire), Anderson (Lancashire), Trott (Warwickshire), Bairstow (Yorkshire), Plunkett (Yorkshire), Rashid (Yorkshire) or Tredwell (Kent).

All article text:(CNN)A grand jury in Clark County, Nevada, has indicted a 19-year-old man accused of fatally shooting his neighbor in front of her house last month. Erich Nowsch Jr. faces charges of murder with a deadly weapon, attempted murder and firing a gun from within a car. Police say Nowsch shot Tammy Meyers, 44, in front of her home after the car he was riding in followed her home February 12. Nowsch's attorney, Conrad Claus, has said his client will argue self-defense. The Meyers family told police that Tammy Meyers was giving her daughter a driving lesson when there was a confrontation with the driver of another car. Tammy Meyers drove home and sent her inside to get her brother, Brandon, who allegedly brought a 9mm handgun. Tammy Meyers and her son then went back out, police said. They encountered the other car again, and there was gunfire, police said. Investigators found casings from six .45-caliber rounds at that scene. Nowsch's lawyer said after his client's first court appearance that Brandon Meyers pointed a gun before anyone started shooting. He said the family's story about a road-rage incident and what reportedly followed don't add up. After zipping away from the first shooting, Tammy Meyers drove home and the other car, a silver Audi, went there also. Police said Nowsch shot at both Tammy and Brandon Meyers. Tammy Meyers was hit in the head and died two days later at a hospital. Brandon Meyers, who police said returned fire at the home, was not injured. The driver of the silver Audi has yet to be found by authorities. That suspect wasn't named in Thursday's indictment. Nowsch was arrested five days after the killing in his family's house, just one block away from the Meyers' home. He is due in court Tuesday for a preliminary hearing.

All article text:Entertainers, actors and priests are now claimed to be part of a VIP child abuse ring that Scotland Yard stands accused of covering up. The paedophiles were initially said to include MPs, senior police officers, and judges, but now investigators have revealed the net has been widened further. Over 30 years, officers from Scotland Yard are said to have also protected entertainers, actor, and priest by shutting down inquiries. The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17 . Probe: Police allegedly stopped investing a child sex ring based in Dolphin Square in Westmister, pictured . The police watchdog has now added a further three alleged paedophilia cover-ups by the Metropolitan Police to the investigation, bring the total to 17. In a statement the IPCC said the police investigation had 'gathered evidence against MPs, judges, media entertainers, police, actors, clergy and others'. Criminal proceedings were being prepared, but two months later an officer was called in by a senior Metropolitan Police officer and told to drop the case, it is alleged. The IPCC is also looking into an allegation about police actions during a child abuse investigation in the 1980s, and another complaint about the same investigation - although no details of this have been given. Allegations: Sarah Green of the IPCC will oversee the investigation into the corruption claims . The watchdog said all the allegations relate to 'suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations' and the 'covering up the offences because of the involvement of members of parliament and police officers'. When the probe was announced earlier this month, commentators said It could be the biggest investigation into police corruption since the 1970s. The Metropolitan Police force is leading the investigation into the alleged corrupt actions of its officers but the IPCC says it is closely monitoring their probe. The IPCC had last week announced that it is investigating 14 allegations. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is also assessing a further six referrals it has received from the force as part of the case. When the investigation was launched The IPCC Deputy Chair Sarah Green said: 'These allegations are of historic, high level corruption of the most serious nature. 'We will oversee the investigations and ensure that they meet the terms of reference that we will set. 'Allegations of this nature are of grave concern and I would like to reassure people of our absolute commitment to ensuring that the investigations are thorough and robust.' The complex web of allegations was uncovered by detectives probing claims of historical sex abuse first raised by Labour MP Tom Watson in October 2012. The claims include that police deliberately stalled their inquiries into the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, south-west London, leaving dozens of boys to be abused. Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys . Former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, pictured left, has been alleged to be involved in an establishment cover-up, as has William Whitelaw, pictured right, also a former Home Secretary . Officers are also accused of releasing paedophile MP Cyril Smith without charge after he was caught in an undercover operation at a sex party involving teenage boys. It has also been claimed officers failed to end sex parties at the now notorious Dolphin Square complex, in Pimlico, central London, following the intervention of ‘prominent people’. Tory home secretary, William Whitelaw, who is accused of demanding that police drop an inquiry into a paedophile ring, is also under the spotlight.  As is former Home Secretary Leon Brittan. Both men have since died. Police were accused of hushing-up allegations about disgraced ex-Top Of The Pops  presenter Jimmy Savile .

All article text:The new Republican governor of Illinois has said New Jersey is 'going down the drain' - despite it being run by fellow Republican Chris Christie, who sent $7million his way in the latest election campaign. Bruce Rauner said the Garden State was 'lost', thanks in part to its high property taxes. Rauner hit out at New Jersey, which has had Christie as governor since 2010, during a speech at the Illinois Farm Bureau last week. Sniping: Bruce Rauner, right, has said that New Jersey, the state run by his ally Chris Christie, left, is 'a disaster' because of its tax regime . Rauner's backer: Christie's Republican Governors Association gave $7million to Rauner's campaign in the 2014 governor elections . He said: 'We've got the highest property taxes in America other than New Jersey. I don't want to compete with New Jersey on anything, especially that. That's a disaster.' The State Register-Journal of Springfield, Illinois, reported that he continued: 'New Jersey is lost. They're going down the drain, and they ain't turning it around.' The staunch criticism may come as a surprise to Christie, who as the head of the Republican Governors Association funneled $7million in campaign funds to help him topple Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn. Christie often showed up on the campaign trail alongside Rauner, and boasted that he 'didn't come empty-handed' after making a $2.5million top-up to the coffers. He's behind you: Rauner, left, stands behind Christie during a Chicago fundraiser in which the two ate jumbo hotdogs . CBS Chicago reported how during the campaign Rauner and Christie made a public appearance to order jumbo hotdogs together before a hotel fundraiser. In return, Rauner has often been a vocal Christie fan. NJ.com reports that he has described him as 'one of the greatest public servants in America today' and 'a superstar'. Rauner spent a total of $37million on TV ads alone in the campaign, in which he outspent Quinn by some $9million, according to the Center for Public Integrity. The Center's records from the 2014 governor elections show Christie's association sent a total of $7million Rauner's way. Spokesmen for Christie and Rauner have yet to comment.

All article text:It is known to prevent against heart disease and is hailed as the secret to a long, healthy life. Now, researchers have found the Mediterranean diet can help people with depression, too. A study found people who followed the diet were happier, less stressed and reported an improved quality of life compared to those who ate fewer Mediterranean foods. The researchers said omega-3 in particular, a fatty acid found in fish, plays a vital role in maintaining and improving mental health and stability. The diet consists of plant-based foods such as vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, seeds and olives, extra virgin olive oil, fish, with moderate red wine intake. It also involves a low consumption of processed food, processed carbohydrates, sweets and chocolate and red meat. Omega-3, a fatty acid found in fish, plays a vital role in maintaining and improving mental health and stability . As part of the study, Australian researchers recruited a total of 82 adults with depression, aged between 18 -65. They assessed their mental health and quality of life using two official scales: the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). They then assessed how strongly they followed the Mediterranean diet through a 14-item questionnaire. The study’s lead author, Dr Natalie Parletta, of the University of South Australia, said there was a strong link between the Mediterranean diet and lower scores for mental illness. This was despite the fact it was a study of people with depression, who tended to have poor diets in the first place. She told MailOnline: ‘What we found is that poor diet is predicting the onset of depression. ‘It’s not that people are getting depressed and then eating badly, eating badly causes the depression in the first place. ‘We recruited people who had depression already. We screened out people who had good diet. ‘So it was amazing that there was a significant correlation the Mediterranean diet and mental illness, even for people with low scores on the consumption of wholefoods.’ She said research shows there is an overlap between heart disease and depression, and scientists have begun to think there might be common underlying mechanisms. Inflammation and insulin resistance which occurs in the body and causes heart disease could also cause depression in the brain, she said. ‘The brain is an organ like any other,’ she explained. ‘It has higher needs than other organs, from bloodflow to delivering oxygen, glucose and nutrients. ‘A lack of bloodflow and inflammation can affect the brain as much as any other organ. A Mediterranean diet is high in nutrients such as omega-3, vitamin B, vitamin D, healthy fats and anti-oxidants, she said, which are all important for keeping the brain functioning well and staving off mental illness. Sometimes depression is 'biological', the researchers said. It can be a deficiency in some of the nutrients that keep the brain functioning properly . There has been a lot of research on how omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, play a vital role in maintaining or improving mental health and stability. Deficiency in these nutrients can impair the brain’s functioning and lead to depression, she added. She said: ‘There are many challenges in life, and factors that lead to depression. But by developing a strong foundation for our brain to function well through providing it with key nutrients, we’re better able to deal with life’s challenges. ‘And it’s not just the nutrients - the fibre is also beneficial. Highly fibrous foods means you’re not getting mood swings through sugar. She continued: ‘Sometimes depression is biological. It could be a wheat allergy, it’s rarely known that an intolerance can lead to depression and even bipolar. ‘Depending on the person, a deficiency could be the key link to what is causing mental illness.’ On the other hand, a poor diet can lead to depression, stress and anxiety, she said. She explained hat highly processed foods, red meat and confectionary increase our blood glucose levels, leading to sensitivity to insulin – the hormone that controls how much sugar is in our blood – and obesity. This inflammation affects the brain, causing mental illness. When the body is stressed or anxious, it goes into fight or flight mode which shuts down digestion and healing. Eating Vegetables, fruits and legumes ensures it has the nutrients it needs to function properly . When a person is stressed and anxious, they go into a ‘fight or flight’ mode in which stress hormones are released, making the body more aroused and responsive, shifting blood from the skin to the muscles, and raising heart rate. This shuts down digestion and healing. ‘If you’re in a state of stress, your body isn’t absorbing as many nutrients as possible, so the need for nutrients is increased,' Dr Parletta said. 'You’ll be in a better state to replenish the nutrients if you’re eating a nutrient-rich Mediterranean diet. 'So no stress is best of all, but a Mediterranean diet with stress is better than a poor diet with stress.' The results indicate that dietary intervention may improve mental health and so the researchers are seeking more volunteers to further examine the ability of diet combined with fish oil supplementation to improve mental health. They are now looking for volunteers aged 18-65 in Adelaide who have depression, to investigate this further.

A teenage mother has died after giving birth to twins eight weeks before their due date without ever getting the chance to hold her newborn babies. Sophie Burgess gave birth to Evie and Oliver at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital after suffering cramps. The 19-year-old, who was unconscious when the babies were born, contracted septicaemia and was rushed into a critical care unit. She died 48 hours later having never met the babies. Her family have since paid tribute to the teenager who 'could not wait' to become a mother. On March 11, Miss Burgess from Telford, Shropshire, rushed to Princes Royal Hospital with her partner Alex Carter, 23, after experiencing cramps. She was transferred to the hospital in Wolverhampton where she gave birth to Oliver naturally. Doctors were then forced to perform an emergency Caesarean section to safely deliver Evie, with Miss Burgess unconscious throughout the procedure. Miss Burgess was moved to the hospital's critical care unit but died 48 hours later. Speaking of his younger sister, who worked as a care worker,  Miss Burgess's brother, Craig, said: 'It is so sad that my sister never got to hold her children but Alex has not left their side since. Miss Burgess gave birth to Oliver naturally before doctors were forced to perform an emergency Caesearean to safely deliver Evie . 'They are out of the incubators now and both seem to be doing well. They are amazing and Sophie would have been so proud of them. 'I honestly cannot begin to describe Sophie, she was full of life. She could not wait to become a mother and as a family we will make sure her babies never forget her. They are her legacy now.' Miss Burgess's mother, Mandy, said the family did not know what had caused the 19-year-old to contract septicaemia which is poisoning in the blood. 'Sophie contracted septicaemia after giving birth to her twins, the reason behind this is still unknown but the hospital have been conducting their own investigations. 'We are now planning Sophie's funeral.' She had been living at the family's Telford home with her partner throughout her pregnancy. The babies weighed just 3lbs each once delivered eight weeks early in Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital . The babies' father, Alex Carter, has 'not left their side' since their mother's death last week. They remain in incubators . 'Sophie and her boyfriend, Alex, lived at home with me while she was pregnant and we will be helping him alongside his family to bring up the twins when they get out of hospital.' 'He has been an exceptional dad to Oliverand Evie so far.' A friend of the family has set up an online donations page to contribute towards the twins' upbringing as doctors at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital investigate what caused the young mother to take ill. Ria Norris, who grew up with Miss Burgess, said she would have been 'a fantastic mother'. 'She was so prepared for it. With her being young people might think they wouldn't t have been but both she and Alex really were.' Friends and relatives said Miss Burgess 'could not wait to become a mother' After being told that she might struggle to conceive children when she was younger, the care worker was 'over the moon' to learn she was pregnant last year, she added. 'She was absolutely elated. The whole family was,' said Mrs Norris, 32. 'Sophie loved being pregnant, she absolutely thrived on it. I think having been told that it might be difficult she just totally embraced it.' 'The twins are the first grandchildren in the family so it's very special.' Mr Carter was equally excited having been with Miss Burgess for years, she said. 'Alex was over the moon. He hasn't left the babies' side since they were born either. 'It's amazing when in a situation where he might have some emotions, he doesn't have any resentment towards anyone. 'He is amazing.' New Cross Hospital has launched an investigation into what may have caused Miss Burgess to contract septicaemia. Jonathan Odum, medical director at the hospital, said staff had been 'deeply affected' by the young mother's death. 'Sadly Sophie developed a severe illness following the birth of her twins from which she deteriorated very quickly,' he said. 'Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff looking after her, she passed away on a critical care unit a few hours later. 'The staff in the maternity department and the critical care unit have been deeply affected by Sophie's death and the trust would like to pass on it's sympathy and condolences to her family and friends. 'An investigation into the cause of her death is currently being carried out.' To visit the gofundme page set up in Miss Burgess's memory click here.

Sakho has scored 11 goals for the Hammers so far this season; nine of which in the Premier League, and he and his team-mates have now been rewarded for their hard work with a trip abroad. On West Ham's mid-season break to Dubai, Sakho took to the tennis court in the Dubai sunshine . Sakho did not seem as comfortable on the tennis court as he does for West Ham on the football pitch . West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald told the club's official website: 'Since the start of December it's been full on and we're only just coming up for air at the start of March. 'It's been a tough couple of months but what we normally do is go away so the lads can get a bit of sun on their backs. 'We do a bit of training in the gym and along the beach, as well as having a couple of football sessions. It's more important that they have a bit of relaxation time and get the sun on their backs. 'In last two or three months everyone’s had their tracksuit tops, gloves and hats on and it’ll be great to go across there and we’ll still be working, but special for the boys that it’s in the heat.'

Last month, their father Michael Wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to Phuoc - leaving him with an impossible decision after being a match for both girls, but only able to give the donation to one daughter. Following doctors' suggestions that he  give the transplant to Phuoc since she needed it the soonest, they underwent surgery in February. The pair were reunited  in a heart-warming moment shared by the family after the successful surgery. Scroll down for video . Phuoc Wagner (pictured above 17 days after her liver transplant surgery), three, who received a life-saving liver transplant from her father, has had her long-awaited homecoming postponed after contracting norovirus . Last month, her father Michael Wagner was able to give a portion of his liver to her, which left him to make an impossible decision after realizing he would only be able to give the donation to just one of his daughters (above Phuoc post surgery last month) The toddler remains in hospital while she recovers from the stomach flu (above a post about the delayed homecoming written by her mother, Johanne) Phuoc and Binh (the girls pictured above), adopted from Vietnam, were both in need of liver transplants because they suffer from Alagille syndrome, a genetic condition . The girls mother, Johanne, said that they are still waiting on a living donor for Binh as they continue to be patient for Phuoc's return home, according to ABC News. However in good news, reports last month said the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto had received 400 submissions from people offering to be a living donor for Binh. Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook: 'No homecoming yet - norovirus is keeping Phuoc in hospital. And norovirus in my house as well. Home front needs to be clear before they can come home.' Only a few days ago, she had written of the reunion between the girls, and also her nervous feelings about welcoming Phuoc back after her surgery. Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and five days after the operation, the family posted a video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery . In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls (above, Phuoc pictured right, with her mother, left, holding Binh) 'Binh and Phuoc will soon be reunited. Talks of Phuoc's release from hospital this week. Some time spent together before Binh's transplant will be beneficial. Both girls keep asking for each other and the family needs to be reunited,' she wrote. 'It is scary though to welcome her back so soon after transplant. A lot of new stuff to assimilate. Daily nursing visits for weeks to come to administer IV meds and perform bloodwork. 'But most of all, the fear of something going wrong, and quickly. No germs allowed in our household. A lot of quiet time needed to allow for full recovery for both Daddy and Phu-Phu.' Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and five days after the operation, the family posted a  video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. Mrs Wagner (above with Binh at their family home) wrote on Facebook that the girls keep asking to see each other while Phuoc is still in hospital. She confirmed that their search continues for a living donor for Binh . The mother shared her concerns about welcoming Phuoc back after her surgery and having nervous feelings about something going wrong (above her post on Facebook) 'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. He then moves to side of Phuoc's bed and kisses her on the head and asks how she fells in French, as the two share a tender father-daughter moment. Mrs Wagner posted pictures of the reunion as well, and updated supporters on her husband and daughter's recovery, as well as their continued search to find a donor for Binh. 'So hard to believe we are hitting the one week mark: it seems like a blur,' Mrs Wagner wrote on Facebook. 'Michael still in hospital, Phuoc still on morphine, and mommy holding on on coffee. Still a fair amount of discomfort for Michael but he managed to visit his little girl two days in a row.' In the run-up to the surgery, Mr Wagner said it has been hard for him to accept that he could only help one of his girls. The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto has received 400 submissions from people wanting to be donors for Binh . 'The cruel part of the liver is that you can only do it once,' he told the site Yahoo Canada. The Wagners said the girls’ doctor was the one who ultimately decided that Phuoc would get her father’s liver based on medical necessity. Gary Levy, who runs the liver donor program at the Toronto General Hospital, told The Canadian Press vial Global News that donors can give up to 70 per cent of their liver, which will regrow to its full size, but it can only be done once. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phuoc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were nine pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne adopted Phuoc and Binh when they were 18 months old after seeing they were in poor health at a Vietnamese orphanage .

All article text:(CNN)The owner of a Chinese restaurant in Nairobi, Kenya has been arrested following an uproar over its policy of banning African customers at night, according to reports. Owner Zhao Yang was arrested for operating a restaurant without a valid license shortly after local press ran a story alleging that Kenyan reporters were turned away from the restaurant -- for being African. Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper carried a story Monday that its reporters had been barred entry to the restaurant, being told by a guard at the entrance that "the time for Africans is over" when the journalists arrived at 7 p.m. Only locals accompanied by Chinese, European or Indian patrons would be admitted, the newspaper reported. It also reported that two local politicians, "loyal patrons" Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko and former Cabinet Minister Raphael Tuju, had been admitted, the latter being a friend of the owner. Kenyan social media users were quickly up in arms about the ban, taking to Facebook and Twitter to voice their displeasure, using the hashtag #noblacksallowed. The establishment, known only as Chinese Restaurant, in the Kilimani neighborhood of Nairobi, has subsequently been closed after it transpired that it lacked several necessary licenses, said reports. The Daily Nation reported that the Chinese-owned eatery lacked liquor, health or change-of-use licences -- the latter needed as the property had been converted from a residence to a restaurant. Co-owner and restaurant manager Esther Zhao told the newspaper that the "no Africans at night" policy had its roots in security concerns. "We don't admit Africans that we don't know because you never know who is Al-Shabaab and who isn't," she said, referencing the Islamist militant group that is active in Kenya and neighboring Somalia. "It is not like it is written on somebody's face that they are a thug armed with a gun," she said. The restaurant's owners appeared to admit culpability in a statement reproduced in the newspaper. "Because of the concern of the business environment at night and the bad memory of (a robbery in) 2013, we adopted certain measures. Unfortunately, some of the measures were inappropriate, we sincerely apologize for this," the management said in a statement. China is the largest outside investor in African economies but resentment against Chinese in Kenya and other African nations is significant as many Africans often regard Chinese businesses as, in the words of one Chinese journalist, "resource predators" or "environmental vandals." One Kenyan reporter commenting on the restaurant's ban likened the policy to a new form of colonialism in Africa. There is this Chinese restaurant next to Nairobi hospital  and my two colleagues Patrick Mayoyo and Dennis Onsarigo and ...

Yet it could have been a lot worse for the BT Sport pundit when you compare it to others that suffered similar fates when presenting by the pitch. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown was victim to a flying ball during his punditry duty at the Emirates in 2012, and even manager Harry Redknapp fell foul during a training session. Paul Scholes discovered the perils of reporting on the touchline at St James' Park on Wednesday night . Scholes reacts after the ball hits him during the warm-up for Newcastle vs Manchester United . Redknapp reacted furiously during a television interview when a ball hit the then-Portsmouth manager as he shouted: 'How can you kick that over here? You try kicking it in the goal and you hit me? 'Got to get some f****** brains, haven't you? No wonder he's in the f****** reserves.' Speaking with FourFourTwo in 2003, he refused to name which player he was yelling at: 'I mustn't tell you the name of the player. It wouldn't be fair. He was on shooting practice and I was standing at the corner flag when the ball hit me – that tells you everything.' At least that wasn't in front of an audience like Sportsmail's unfortunate columnist in January 2012. Arsenal legend Keown got smacked in the face while on duty for ESPN by a stray ball during the warm-up for an FA Cup match at the Emirates where Leeds United were the visitors. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown is smacked by the ball during the warm-up for Arsenal vs Leeds United . The Arsenal legend is hit as he is asked a question during his punditry duty for ESPN in January 2012 . Keown was hit by a stray ball during the warm-up but joked about it in his column for the Daily Mail later . Writing in his column for the Daily Mail days later, Keown joked about the incident: 'It was a former Spurs man who you may have seen hit me with the ball while I was on-air on Monday night. 'Alex Bruce tipped me off that his Leeds team-mate Michael Brown – the ex-Tottenham midfielder – was the culprit. At least he was apparently trying to aim at Robbie Savage, not me.' Over to Germany, where SkySports reporter Jessica Kastrop was smacked in the back of the head by a stray shot from former Chelsea player Khalid Boulahrouz in 2010. The footage shows the ball getting closer and closer to its victim until it knocks her forward. Kastrop said afterwards: 'I was fine eventually. Boulahrouz ran over to me straight away and apologised.' What about in other sports? American football has its moments, too, such as when Fox reporter Pam Oliver was hit by a Chandler Harnish throw. Thankfully she laughed it off afterwards. SkySports reporter Jessica Kastrop was smacked by a stray shot from ex-Chelsea player Khalid Boulahrouz . Michael Owen (left) and Steve McManaman (right) were others on the touchline for BT Sport at St James' Park . Another female reporter was wiped - not by a football, however, but by a player. Even baseball reporters aren't immune. Fox presenter Sophia Minnaert was hit by a stray ball that knocked the microphone out of her hand. Afterwards she said: 'Do I get kudos for that defensive play? I'm fine. I'm totally fine.' It's all part of the dangers of reporting on the touchline, though Scholes may consider himself lucky.

Or travelling to Wales to visit a second-floor council flat that houses the world's only baked bean museum? We may be a small island  but we do brilliantly bonkers attractions remarkably well. Here are some of the quirkiest attractions in the UK. Scroll down for video . Robert Opie started Museum of Brands in 1984 and has collected over half a million wrappers and packages . Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising . Where: Notting Hill, London . As the name suggests, this is a museum dedicated to discarded wrappers and packaging. The man behind it is Robert Opie, who has amassed a treasured collection of over half a million items, although only about 12,000 are displayed here. His light bulb moment came in 1963 when the obsessive collector was 16 and had just finished some Rowntree’s Munchies and McVitie's and Price ginger nuts. His thinking was that if he threw away the wrappers a small fragment of history would be consigned to rubbish. The consumer historian has since become an authority on the history of supermarket brands and written twenty books on the subject. As well as biscuit tins and soap powder expect nostalgic toys, games and posters. The light bulb moment came in 1963 when the obsessive collector was 16 and polished off some snacks . Captain Beany has curated a collection of bean tins,  money boxes, posters and other one-off memorabilia . Baked Bean Museum . Where: Port Talbot, Wales . Congratulations are in order for the 10-year anniversary of the world’s only museum dedicated to baked beans. Captain Beany (previously Barry Kirk - he changed his name by deed poll) installed the exhibit dedicated to Heinz in his Port Talbot council flat back in 2005. From a second-floor flat on the Aberavon seafront the bean enthusiast has curated a collection of bean tins, bean money boxes, posters and other one-off memorabilia. The walls, ceiling and curtains are all orange and, when the opportunity arises, he dresses up in a cape, green pants, orange jumpsuit and painted face to become his alter ego, Captain Beany. Visits are by appointment only and while there’s no fee, you may be asked to make a charitable donation. Abbey Pumping Station has a loo with a see-through waste pipe so you can watch the progress of excrement . Abbey Pumping Station . Where: Leicester . In the 19th century this is where Leicester’s sewage was pumped to be treated. Today its exhibits include the history of terminology for bodily waste written onto a toilet door and a loo with a see-through waste pipe so you can watch the progress of excrement ‘from flush to drain’. The world's longest colour pencil measures 26ft and is located at the Cumberland Pencil Museum . Cumberland Pencil Museum . Where: Keswick, Cumbria . If you thought pencils were boring,  visit this museum in Cumbria. You’ll find the world’s longest colour pencil (25ft and 11 inches) and a pencil used by RAF pilots with a hidden map and compass to navigate them out of war-time situations. Other joys include the history of graphite and discovering how factories get colour inside  a pencil. The World Worm Charming Championships have been held once a year in Cheshire since 1980 . World Worm Charming Championships . Where: Cheshire . This only happens once a year but it is well worth the wait. Competitors gather in an attempt to charm as many worms from the ground as possible in a set time. The sport was officially born on 5 July 1980 when a local Willaston farmer’s son, Tom Shufflebotham, charmed 511 worms out of the ground in half an hour. The competition has been running ever since and a regulatory body  has been formed to enforce 18 rules and prevent cheating. The event has a history of people cheating by hiding worms up their trousers and sprinkling them on  grass . There’s even such a thing as the International Federations of Charming Worms and Allied Pastimes. Quite necessary, as it turns out, as the event has a history of people hiding worms up their trouser legs then sprinkling them onto the grass and even chopping worms in half to boost their final worm-count. The date for this year’s event has yet to be released but it typically falls in June. The cement menagerie was sculpted by local builder John Fairnington to amuse his disabled son . Cement Menagerie . Where: Branxton . Just off the A697 between Cornhill-on-Tweed and Milfield there’s a spectacle not to be missed. The cement menagerie was sculpted in the 1960s and '70s by a local builder called John Fairnington to amuse his disabled son Edwin. The 300-odd charming statues of animals and humans  include models of zebras, sheep, Lawrence of Arabia on his camel, and Winston Churchill. Each was based on drawings and sculpted in galvanised wire netting stuffed with paper, then cemented over and painted. The garden is free to visit but welcomes donations.
