The Liverpool captain will leave Anfield in the summer to play for LA Galaxy in the USA, and got sent off in his final clash with Manchester United after just 38 seconds of being on the pitch. Gerrard came steaming into a challenge with Juan Mata initally, before an off-the-ball stamp on Ander Herrera resulted in a straight red card from referee Martin Atkinson. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard apologised to his team-mates and fans after being sent off on Sunday . Juan Mata (top) was on the receiving end of Gerrard's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch . Gerrard then appeared to stamp on Ander Herrera, and received his marching orders from the referee . Former Reds keeper Grobbelaar believes Gerrard wasn't fully focused on the match and is already looking ahead to the next step of his career. 'Steven Gerrard wanted to stamp his authority on to the match,' Grobbelaar told talkSPORT. 'I know that Gerrard’s heart is in Liverpool, and always will be, but his head unfortunately is in Los Angeles. 'He said himself that he takes full responsibility for what his actions were. A lot of other referees would have just given a yellow and warned him to stamp it out because there were some other hefty challenges and some tackles that could've gone either way.' Gerrard is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson after just 38 seconds of the second-half .

All article text:Deceased: Jason Kortz has been identified as the Navy SEAL who fell to his death during a training exercise in Southern California . Navy officials say a SEAL killed when his parachute malfunctioned during training in Southern California was a 29-year-old Colorado man who completed basic training to become a SEAL last year. Naval Special Warfare Group One said Thursday that Jason Kortz of Highlands Ranch, Colorado, died from injuries sustained during the accident in Perris on Wednesday. The Navy is investigating why the parachute malfunctioned. It released no further details. Naval Special Warfare Group One is the Coronado-based SEALs group to which the sailor was assigned. Kortz enlisted in the Navy in 2012 and completed basic training for the SEALs last year in Coronado. He is survived by his wife, parents and brother. KABC-TV captured an aerial shot of the commando's body on the ground covered by an American flag with first responders gathered around. Paramedics apparently received a report around 9am on Wednesday that there was a 'skydiver down' at a grassy location outside of Perris in Riverside County. The sailor died of injuries sustained in the daytime parachute jump but no other details were immediately available. Kortz was identified by officials as a West Coast-based member of the Naval Special Warfare Group ONE. All Navy SEALS are required to take parachute jump course during their qualification training. Fateful accident: A navy SEAL has died after his parachute malfunctioned during a skydiving training exercise in Southern California . Scene of the incident: Paramedics apparently received a report around 9am on Wednesday that there was a 'skydiver down' at a grassy location outside of Perris in Riverside County . During missions they are often air-dropped into extremely difficult-to-reach places meaning they  must know how to navigate different heights and terrains. Indeed, the  SEAL name is short for sea, air and land. Perris is a popular area for skydivers with one of the largest skydiving centers in the world, Skydive Perris. The facility declined to comment on Wednesday's skydiving fatality. This was at least the 20th death reported at the Perris facility since 2000. The last death occurred last November, when  Justin Gulley, 36, of Canyon Lake was involved in a landing accident.

All article text:DIY giant B&Q announced today it is to shut one in six of its least profitable stores after its annual profits fell £75million last year. The home improvement chain  is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business. Shares in Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in the UK, jumped up 16p each - a five per cent rise - when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning. Changes: B&Q is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its UK and Ireland business . Parent company Kingfisher, which also owns Screwfix, plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360-strong B&Q estate. The move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to £675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to £11billion in the year to January 31. This is down from 744million in the 2013-14 year. The planned store closures form part of a plan by new Chief Executive Veronique Laury to shake-up the 360-store B&Q business. Kingfisher, which trades as B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, made a pre-tax profit of 675 million pounds  in the year to January 31.The results are the first to be presented by Laury, who succeeded Ian Cheshire in December. Veronique Laury said the closure plan was one of a number of 'sharp' decisions being taken by the FTSE 100 company. She added: 'Home improvement is a great market with huge potential and Kingfisher has a strong position within it with further scope to grow in a sustainable way. However, it is clear to me that we need to organise ourselves very differently to unlock our potential.' Other plans include cutting back on some of the 393,000 products sold across the company, particularly as only 7,000 - amounting to 7 per cent of sales - are currently sold in at least two of Kingfisher's operating companies. The company will also look to optimise vacant store space and is in discussions with several retailers about sub-letting opportunities. Kingfisher said the impact on jobs from the B&Q store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the Screwfix brand, while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business. Ms Laury denied that the UK DIY market was in decline and said the store closure plan reflected a desire to reinvigorate the company's UK offer. She added that it had long been clear that B&Q had too many stores in its estate. B&Q UK & Ireland's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to £3.7 billion in the financial year, with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent. Profits were 16 per cent higher at £276million. In contrast, profits in France were 12 per cent lower at £349 million due to the impact of weak consumer confidence and a declining housing and construction market. Kingfisher said it will close a small number of stores in the country. It came as Kingfisher, which had a binding agreement to buy French rival Mr Bricolage, was forced to pull out of the £200m deal. The acquisition had been referred to competition authorities because Kingfisher already owns Castorama and Brico Depot in France. While it had the backing of a key shareholder, support was withdrawn by franchisee group the Association Nationale des Promoteurs du Faites Le Vous-Même (ANPF), which holds a 42pc stake in Mr Bricolage. Forty-four of Mr Bricolage's 500 stores, many of them franchises, would had to have been sold to placate regulators. It has since emerged that today was the deadline for the deal and all parties had to agree if there was an extension.

But while this has its undoubted challenges, getting your child to support the same football team is surely a must. In this hilarious video, a young father perches his son on his knee, and begins a chant in honour of his favourite team - Nottingham Forest. After a reluctant start, 10-month-old Joshua soon throws himself into his father's Nottingham Forest chant . The toddler is well trained it seems, and almost as if he is on the terraces himself, he joins in with the actions football fans everywhere will recognise. The father shouts out 'Forest,' in reference to the Nottinghamshire club who play their football in Sky Bet Championship. At this point 10-month old Joshua raises his hands in the air. 'Come on you boys in red,' continues the father, which is met by the blonde-haired child clapping his hands together. The actions are met with a wide smile and attempts at copying his father's chants. With a cheeky smile, Joshua shows he is well on the way to following the Championship club . The man seated then shouts 'Nottingham's red and white' on two occasions, but the toddler's exertions appear to have tired him out, and he holds his hands behind his head. Nottingham Forest are sitting ten points of a play-off place in the Championship, and facing a tall order to reach the promised land of the Premier League. Maybe when he's older, Joshua might get to see Forest taking on the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal.

Everybody is saying she is an incarnation of the God,' the baby's aunt Rajani told ANI. 'This is why whoever hears about her is coming here to get a glimpse of the baby and are making whatever offerings possible.' The girl comes from a poor family with her father, a vegetable vendor who earns 250 rupee ($5.17) per day, hoping his daughter's birth will bring the family better luck, the Times of India reported.

All article text:Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe was left furious after his side were denied what he felt was a legitimate goal against Cardiff City on Tuesday night. Striker Callum Wilson stood with his back to goal as opposition goalkeeper Simon Moore attempted to take a goal kick during his side's clash with Cardiff City, only for Moore's clearance to hit the forward. The ball cannoned off the back of the number 13 before hitting the bar, and Wilson, who was signed by Howe from League One outfit Coventry City, then tapped the ball into the empty net. Callum Wilson is standing still outside of the box with his back to goal when the goalkeeper kicks the ball . Wilson and the fans celebrated, but referee Lee Mason was quick to disallow the goal and booked the 23-year-old Bournemouth top scorer, much to Howe's frustration. 'I've got to be very careful with what I say, we've been in a bit of trouble recently with officials,' Howe told BBC Radio Solent. Howe continued: 'Callum (Wilson) did that all night. He didn't move, didn't follow the keeper, he held his ground and by the laws of the game that is perfectly acceptable. It's a goal that should have stood.' Bournemouth striker Wilson just cannot believe his goal has been disallowed by referee Lee Mason . 'You'll have to ask the referee why the goal was not allowed, I don't think he had a particularly good game and that's an understatement. 'Callum was looking the other way, he stood his ground which is allowed and the goalkeeper has kicked it at his back. 'That's a real strange decision and ultimately it's cost us two points.'

All article text:(CNN)Another flight brings another complaint about an airline interfering with a passenger breastfeeding her baby. The mothers who complain about instances of airline employees interfering with their breastfeeding or pumping aren't covering up and going away; they are tweeting out their complaints in 140 characters or less, sometimes in multiple posts, other times taking pictures of longer reports. Kristen Hilderman is the latest mother to say she was hassled while breastfeeding. The Vancouver mother was returning to Canada from a vacation in Costa Rica with her family on Sunday night when, she says, there was a problem on the final leg of her trip. Hilderman was feeding her 5-month-old son on board United Airlines Flight 438 as the aircraft taxied along the runway before taking off from Houston to Vancouver. To describe what happened next, she took a picture of her typed recollections and posted it to Twitter. "A male flight attendant named Keith walked up to our row and said to my husband (loudly, so that everyone around could here ), 'Are you two together?'" Hilderman wrote. When her husband said yes, Hilderman said, the flight attendant "tossed a blanket at him ... and said tersely, 'Then HERE, help her out.' " When she twice asked what he was supposed to help her out with, she said, the flight attendant ignored her. Passengers on the plane were supportive, she said, and told her they hadn't known she was breastfeeding until the flight attendant singled her out. "I've been breastfeeding my son in myriad public places since he was born, and never has anyone made me feel so uncomfortable and ashamed for feeding my baby without putting a cover over his head," she wrote. United Airlines spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm said that the airline reached out to Hilderman on Monday night via Twitter and that airline officials "look forward to speaking more with her and to our crew member to understand what happened." "On our general approach to breast feeding, we welcome nursing mothers on board and we ask that crew members do their best to ensure their comfort and safety as they do with all customers," Dohm wrote in an email. "We also ask nursing mothers and passengers seated near them to be mindful of one another's space and comfort." Hilderman, who filed a complaint with the airline, said United had not contacted her beyond their tweeted reply but said she has found support from allies on social media. Why are we so squeamish about breastfeeding? Delta passenger Lauren Modeen, who needed her breast pump on a January flight but was forced to check it as luggage, started a  Boobs on Board Facebook page that's gained over 1,100 followers in the past month. "Before social media, the majority of these harassment stories went unheard," Modeen wrote in an email. "As a result, airlines faced little pressure to improve and pave a better way for mothers and children." She wants her Facebook page encourage airlines "to publicly post their explicitly clear pro-breastfeeding/pumping policies inside every airplane so the rules are not left to interpretation by an airline employee, and in turn harass/shame/bully a mother." United, Delta and other major U.S. airlines say breastfeeding is allowed on their aircraft, although United doesn't post its policy on the airline website. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Airlines do. Though you can't please everyone in the air, women are allowed to breastfeed in flight, says veteran flight attendant and author Heather Poole, who is also a mother. "Which means if breastfeeding bothers you, maybe try looking away, closing your eyes," said Poole, author of "Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet." And remember that baby could be crying instead, giving you another reason to complain. "Better a happy baby than a crying baby."

A pair of birthday pranks gone wrong have landed a Florida man in jail and his sister with a BB lodged in her buttocks. Christopher Taft, of Holly Hills, Florida, allegedly shot his sister in the backside with a BB gun after she gave him a phallic-shaped cake for his 21st birthday. Taft later told police that he thought it would be funny, according to WKMG-TV. His sister didn't think so. She called the cops. Officers arrived to the home on Sunday and arrested Taft on aggravated battery and battery. His sister told officers she didn't want to press charges, but Taft was hauled away to the Volusia County Jail anyway. According to WKMG, Taft's sister had the BB lodged under the skin in her backside. She refused medical attention and said she would go to the hospital herself to have the pellet removed. Even low-power airguns - like the famous Daisy Red Ryder - have muzzle velocity of 350 feet per second, which is enough to break the skin. Others, which can be used to kill small game, can shoot projectiles at velocities of more than 2,000 feet per second. It is not known what kind of BB gun was used.

All article text:Children who are are older when they start school may do well academically and socially in the short-term - but are more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes as teenagers. A team of US researchers studied the impact that starting kindergarten has on children born 60 days before, and 60 days after the cut-off start date. And they found these negative outcomes are significantly more likely for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Children who are are older when they start kindergarten (a stock image is shown) are more likely to do well academically and socially in the short-term, but are also more likely to abandon their studies and commit crimes when they are teenagers, a new study has claimed . Philip Cook, a professor in Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy and lead author of the study, said: ‘This research provides the first compelling evidence of a causal link between dropout and crime. ‘It supports the view that crime outcomes should be considered in evaluating school reforms. ‘Dropouts are greatly over-represented in prison, so we know there is a strong association between dropping out and crime. ‘But to establish causation requires an experiment. My analysis takes advantage of nature's experiment associated with birth date.’ Professor Cook and Songman Kang of Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea carried out the research, published in American Economic Journal-Applied Economics. It is said to be the first study to link dropping out of school, and crime. The study compared North Carolina public school students born 60 days before, and 60 days after the school cut-off date. At the time of the study, children in the state had to turn five by October 16 to be eligible to enter kindergarten that year. Old-for-grade students are more likely to be convicted of a crime before age 20, the study said. A stock image of a young drink driver is shown . Children typically attend kindergarten when they are five or six year's old. Previous studies have established that children born just after the school-entry cut-off date and are ‘old for grade,’ perform better academically than their younger classmates. This has led to some parents trying to gain an academic advantage for children whose birthdays fall shortly before the cut-off date, by enrolling them later. In addition to performing better academically, Professor Cook's study found old-for-grade students were one-third less likely to engage in delinquent behaviour while still in school. ‘Up until the 16th birthday, it is all positive,’ he said. ‘They are doing better, relative to their classmates, by every measure. 'It makes sense, because they are more mature.’ However, after the age of 16, the picture shifts. The old-for-grade students are more likely to drop out and be convicted of a crime before age 20, the study said. The explanation for the behavioural change lies in the age at which students may legally withdraw from school, which is 16 in North Carolina. ‘If they were born before the cut-off date, they have just 19 months between their 16th birthday and graduation to be tempted to drop out,’ he said. ‘If they were born just after and enter school later, they have 31 months, and for some of them, it is an irresistible temptation.’ ‘It's human nature,' Professor Cook said. ‘For a lot of adolescents, high school is a drag.’ Among the old-for-grade students, the likelihood of dropping out and being convicted of a serious crime is almost three-and-half times greater for those born to an unwed mother and just over two-and-a-half times greater for those whose mothers were high school dropouts.

All article text:Media mogul Harvey Weinstein said that he was 'very lucky' to have never experienced anti-Semitism growing up - after making a rousing speech urging the Jewish community to 'get as organised as the mafia' to tackle the problem. The Jewish studio executive, who co-founded film company Miramax before setting up The Weinstein Company, said he had been taught about the issue by his father who had served as a sergeant during World War II. He made the admission after he gave a passionate speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's National Tribute Dinner, where he urged listeners to stand up to anti-Semites and 'kick these guys in the ass'. Harvey Weinstein (right) was introduced by actor Christoph Waltz as he received the Humanitarian Award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center at the glitzy ceremony in Beverly Hills. In his acceptance speech he urged the Jewish community to get 'as organised as the mafia' to tackle anti-Semitism - although said afterwards he had never personally experienced it . When asked by the New York Post whether he had experienced anti-Semitism he said: 'Personally, no', adding: 'I’m very lucky that way. 'My dad did, both in the Army and afterwards, so I can only identify and I feel strongly through him. I’ve had a charmed life that way, but I’m still outraged by what’s going on. 'And we need to know and let the people who are doing those things know they can’t get away with it.' 'Charmed life': Harvey Weinstein pictured next to British actress Keira Knighley at the 18th Annual Hollywood Film Awards in November. His film company produced director Quentin Tarantino's wartime movie Inglourious Basterds, set during the Second World War and The Reader . Jewish: Weinstein said his father, who served during the World War Two, taught their family about the problems faced by Jewish communities around the world . His father Max Weinstein had helped the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organisation based in the Middle East which later became the Israeli Defence Force, during the war. Weinstein, 63, has produced films including The King's Speech, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds set during the Second World War, and last week accepted the Humanitarian Award at the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Studies by the institute have shown that the number of attacks on Jewish communities around the world is at its highest since 1945. The New Yorker used his acceptance speech to tell the audience: 'I think it's time that we, as Jews, get together with the Muslims who are honorable and peaceful — but we [also] have to go and protect ourselves', The Hollywood Reporter wrote. 'Unfortunately, we [Jews] are gonna have to get as organised as the mafia. We just can't take it any more. We just can't take these things. There's gotta be a way to fight back.' 'While we must be understanding of our Arab brothers and our Islamic brothers,' he added, 'we also have to understand that these crazy b******s [Arab and Islamic extremists] are also killing their own — they're killing neighbours, they're killing people from all sorts of different races. 'And, unlike World War II, when we didn't act right away and we paid the price, we better start acting now. Trust me, I'm the last guy who wants to do anything about it, but I realize if we don't, we will perish.'

When doctors told 18-year-old Hannah Tate from Maryville, Tennessee, she was well enough to attend her prom, she took to Instagram to get in touch with hairstylist Tokyo Stylez, who has worked with Rihanna, Naomi Campbell, and Gabrielle Union, in the hopes that he would send her one of his custom-made wigs. But Tokyo took his generosity one step further and secretly began working with Hannah's mother LaVetta Spann in order to personally deliver and style the wig before the Alcoa High School dance. Scroll down for video .

All article text:He's better known for his fancy footwork on the pitch but Liverpool and England striker Daniel Sturridge took time out of scoring goals to get some kitchen action. The 25-year-old Birmingham lad was taken through his culinary paces by his mother Grace, who taught him how to make her favourite dish ahead of Mother's Day. And like her Reds son, mum Grace is a fan of healthy eating and requested the Kop ace to create a high protein meal of spicy grilled chicken with seasoned quinoa and vegetables. Scroll down for video. Daniel Sturridge and kisses his mother Grace after he successfully cooks spicy chicken with quinoa and vegetables as part of his Mother's Day Challenge . The 25-year-old Birmingham lad in action on the pitch, competing with Alex Baptise of Blackburn Rovers during the FA Cup Quarter Final match on Sunday 8 March . The duo joined forces in the kitchen as part of a Sainsbury's Active Kids event at a school in St Paul's RC Junior School, Liverpool. Daniel, who cooks his own meals every day, told FEMAIL: My mum is amazing, she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always. 'To spoil my mum I would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it, fish based maybe. 'Mum loves nice salads and especially avocado, so would definitely include that.' For the challenge the Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassador had to prepare quinoa -  which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with Grace's home-made spicy 'Sturrcrazy' sauce, made to a secret family recipe. The pair cook together when they can although these days it's becoming rarer. Grace said to FEMAIL: 'When we can we like to cook together, but it doesn't happen so often these days, as Daniel lives away from home. Mother and son work together and start off by seasoning the chicken with a mixture of spices . As the chicken marinades the pair chop the vegetables and prepare the rest of the meal . What was Daniel like as a child? Daniel has always been really active, he played football in and out of school. At home he would play out whatever the weather! Because of his naturally active lifestyle, he always loved meal times and eating Afro-Caribbean food. As our family were all sporty and active, it was natural for us to promote healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle. Does he still have the same tastes? Yes still loves it, amongst other things! But Daniel loves anything with spice to it. What is his favourite food? I would say he has two favourite dishes, fish and chicken. The white meat is full of protein so is really good for him and he loves to be able to make both chicken and fish in to spicy dishes, which is why he loves our family's Sturr Crazy sauce. If he was cooking for you, what would he cook? Probably salmon with sweet potatoes and garlic thyme chopped up and cooked in the oven. It's quite an easy dish to make and it's really tasty. He would probably make a side salad with rocket, tomatoes and lots of avocado, he knows I love avocado! What does Daniel mean to you? All of the family are so proud of what Daniel has achieved so far, he gave up so much as a child and we are just so happy that he is achieving his dream, as parents you couldn't wish for more than that for your children! But she still tries to get her family together at weekends. 'Every Sunday we still try and get together as a family and have a typical Afro-Caribbean lunch of spicy meat, rice and peas. 'We love getting together and think it's important to spend that time together,' she continued. Famous for being a proponent of superfoods after his 2014 calf injury saw him miss 13 matches, Daniel now incorporates as much nutrient-packed foods into his diet as he can. 'It's important for me to make sure that I eat a healthy balanced diet as obviously I'm training every day,'he said. 'I do enjoy cooking and I look forward to my dinner each night.' His favourite meal to cook is 'salmon, kale, sweet potato, broccoli and quinoa' which he covers in Sturr Crazy sauce. 'I have it on everything,'he said. 'It adds that perfect amount of spice to a dish; I even took some out to the World Cup with me.' A typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein-rich foods . 'Lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa, with perhaps chicken or fish [as] they are both great for recovery and full of protein,' he said. 'On the side I would have broccoli, spinach, lots of steamed veg. I also drink a lot of white tea and moringa tea throughout the day,' he continued. So far so healthy, but doesn't he have any guilty food secrets? 'I'm pretty good with my diet to be honest, I love healthy food which helps and it is something I have worked on for years. But every now and then you need something sweet, which is fine, but all in moderation,' he said. And does he dance in the kitchen when he's successfully cooked a meal? 'Haha I leave the dancing for on the pitch,' he laughed. Tara Hewitt, Head of Sponsorship for Sainsbury's said: 'It was great to see Daniel and Grace cooking together at the event; they clearly have a passion for great tasting, healthy food.' Result! Daniel and Grace with the finished meal, spicy chicken served with quinoa and steamed veg . Ingredients: Four chicken thighs (skin and boneless); 220g quinoa; four spring onions; one sweet red pepper; two cloves fresh garlic; four medium carrots; one broccoli floret; four spears of asparagus; black pepper, all spice, paprika; dark soy sauce; olive oil . Mehod: Season the chicken with all spice, black pepper, paprika and dark soy sauce and leave to marinate overnight. Pre-heat the oven to 400*F and back chicken for approx 30 mins until golden and cooked through. Splash on some SturrCrazy sauce (or other spicy condiment) and return to the oven for five minutes. Rinse the quinoa thoroughly and place on a high heat with a pinch of salt. Bring to the boil then turn down to simmer for 20 mins until steamed and fluffy then set aside. Whilst the quinoa is steaming, finely chop the onions a quarter of the sweet pepper, two cloves of garlic and pan fry with a splash of olive oil, pepper and season all. Empty and toss the cooked quinoa in with the onions and mix together, adding more seasoning if needed. Peel and chop the carrots, chop the broccoli, trim the asparagus and steam in a pan for five minutes until tender before plating up.

All article text:Sensational footage has emerged showing the father of one of the three schoolgirl 'jihadi brides' at the head of an Islamist rally led by hate preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Michael Adebowale, the killer of soldier Lee Rigby. The video shows Abase Hussen marching at the front of the demonstrators, behind a banner reading: 'The followers of Mohammed will conquer America'. He was filmed chanting 'Allahu Akbar' amid dozens of protesters and standing just yards away as the American flag is burned. Scroll down for video . Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . Cuddly: Hussen appealing for the return of his 'jihadi daughter' a few weeks ago after she ran off . Earlier this month, Mr Hussen blamed police for placing a 'heavy burden' on his daughter by handing her the letter about their inquiry - and the police apologised. Yesterday, a Government report on foreign fighters was released containing testimony from Mr Hussen. But at no time has he mentioned his own passion for militant Islam or attendance at one of the most notorious rallies of the last few years. Hannah Stuart, domestic extremism expert at the Henry Jackson Society, said: . 'We saw Mr Hussen on TV looking very innocent, holding a teddy bear. But he was linked with individuals who espouse an extremist ideology. 'The impression given was that Islamic extremism was an alien world to his daughter. This footage suggests it wasn't.' Mr Hussen's daughter, Amira Abase, 15, fled the UK with two of her closest friends to join Islamic State last month sparking a national outcry. Mr Hussen, who is originally from Ethiopia, led public appeals for her return as their families blamed the authorities for failing to stop them. He addressed MPs at the Home Affairs Select Committee and was filmed appealing for help while clutching his daughter's teddy bear. Last night, Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to see if any criminal offences had been committed. Sinister: Also at the rally was Michael Adebowale who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby the following year . Respectable: Abase Hussen, pictured far right, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee following his daughter's disappearance. The report was released this week . A spokesman said: 'We will review any material brought to our attention which purports to show any criminal offence taking place.' Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Mr Hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of terrifying demonstrations that took place across the world in September 2012. Two men were arrested as the angry mob called for shariah law to be imposed across the UK. Amira Abase fled the UK with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Khadiza Sultana, 16, last month. The trio were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, Bethnal Green Academy, in East London, who left for Syria in December. Their decision to throw themselves into the hands of the brutal Islamic State terrorist group sparked a national outcry. Prime Minister David Cameron led calls for everyone to examine what is motivating our young people to join the barbaric organisation. Earlier this week Mr Hussen travelled to Turkey with relatives of the other two girls. He has since returned to the flat he shares with his wife in East London but could not be contacted last night. Speaking while in Turkey, he said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. 'I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me – that's the feelings I have.' Thousands took to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, which was criticised for ridiculing Islam. In London, more than 150 clashed with police outside the U.S. Embassy in Mayfair as they chanted 'burn, burn USA' and 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great). Images posted online show Mr Hussen at the head of the march, reaching towards an Israeli flag as it is burned. A U.S. stars and stripes was also set on fire. His distinctive face can also be seen as the march moves along the street beside a line of police carriers and officers. Among the rabble-rousers at the march was notorious hate preacher Choudary, with Adebowale at his side. Chilling: A CCTV image of 15-year-old Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana,16, and Shamima Begum,15 at Gatwick Airport before they caught their flight to Turkey . Fanaticism: Footage of the controversial rally showed Mr Hussen chanting among the crowds of protesters. The demonstration, held in 2012, was led by firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Lee Rigby's killer . Extremist: The protest was led by the hate preacher and notorious rabble rouser Anjem Choudary, who made a speech saying that Sharia would take over the entire world, including America and the UK . Shocking: Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage (pictured) to see if any criminal offences had been committed . Their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said: 'Of course they feel responsible for their own children that goes without saying. 'But the fact is these girls were school children and much of what took place clearly took place at school.'

This is years of building up to this, years of warning signs nobody took me seriously about.' He added: 'It's one thing to lose someone in an accident, but when I think about it and knowing the fact that my daughter was shot, intentionally… it wasn't even accidental.' On a GoFundMe page for the girl, William McComber said: 'She was loved by everyone who was lucky enough to know her.' Records show that LaValley has previously been arrested for misdemeanor assault, retail fraud and disturbing the peace in charges dating back to 2001.

All article text:X Factor star Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has joined fellow Geordie TV celebs Ant and Dec in questioning whether she can still vote Labour. The pop superstar said it was 'hard' for her because all her friends and family supported the party - but said she already paid 'a f****** lot of tax' and needed to listen to what the other parties said. Mrs Fernandez-Versini, who has built up an estimated £20million fortune, said she was now a mature woman  and felt a greater responsibility to be well-informed about politics. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini said Mr Miliband proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million would 'f*** me over' It came after 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked the Labour leader Ed Miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him. Other celebrities, including Myleene Klass, Angelina Jolie, Sol Campbell and Bill Oddie have also publicly criticised the Labour Party over the proposed Mansion Tax on expensive homes. But the popular X Factor judge's remarks are likely to particularly sting because of her life-long support for the Labour Party. David Cameron and George Osborne have also made tax cuts the centre of their pitch for re-election. The Tories want to clear the Government's £90billion deficit without any tax rises - while Labour has called for the rich to pay more. Mr Miliband has pledged to restore the 50p tax rate on those who earn more than £150,000, introduce an annual levy on homes worth more than £2million - dubbed the mansion tax - and raise the point at which high earners start paying 40 per cent of their income to the government. Mrs Fernandez-Versini told the Telegraph's Stella magazine that she would 'listen' more carefully to other parties now that she paid so much in tax. The 'Crazy Stupid Love' singer also suggested she could 'make my own party' adding that 'stranger things have happened'. 'It's hard for me, because all my friends and family vote Labour,' she said. Asked if she would consider voting for David Cameron, she replied: 'Not really. I want to hear what everyone's got to say. 'I've always been Labour all my life but I want to hear what they've got to say for myself. Now that I'm a mature woman. 'I feel like a greater responsibility now to vote for who runs our country. And I pay a f****** lot of tax. So I think that I need to have a really well-informed, well-educated opinion.' The 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked Mr Miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him . The X Factor darling has built up a fortune since her pop career took off after being voted onto the pop band Girls Aloud on the 2002 TV show, Popstars The Rivals. Despite growing up on a council estate as one of five children in Newcastle, she now earns a reported £2million a year as a judge on X Factor and face of L'Oreal. Last year, she married French playboy Jean Bernard Fernandez Versini - who owns pop-up bar Cosy Box in Cannes. It came after she divorced England footballer Ashley Cole in 2010 citing ‘unreasonable behaviour’ after numerous allegations of cheating on his part. Despite her wealth Mrs Fernandez-Versini said there were 'big downsides that come with having money'. Ed Miliband's proposed mansion tax has been attacked by a string of celebrities . She said: 'As many as with not having money. I mean, they're different types of stresses, but they're both stresses.' Mrs Fernandez-Versini later claimed on Twitter that her remarks had been taken out of context, adding: 'I am a labour supporter, but will always want to hear what everyone has to say.' Her comments come after presenter Myleene Klass attacked Mr Miliband over the policy, claiming it would hit 'little grannies' whose homes had increased in value over decades, rather than the super rich. Actress Angelina Jolie said she could be 'put off' from moving to Britain by the proposal, which would come in this year if Labour wins on May 7. Mr Miliband was left bruised after And and Dec questioned whether he was up to be Prime Minister. Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.' His Britain's Got Talent co-star Ant McPartlin – also 39 – said the pair were 'staunchly Labour' but didn't know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband. The remarks appear to echo public concern over Mr Miliband's leadership, with just 80 days until the election. According to the latest polls, more than half the public think Mr Miliband is doing a bad job – with less than a quarter happy with his leadership. His overall approval rating has slumped to minus 29. This is stark contrast to David Cameron – who splits opinion down the middle, according to the pollsters Opinium. The PM has a net approval rating of minus one. Despite Mr Cameron's personal advantage, Labour continue to be ahead by two points in the polls – on 35 per cent, compared to the Tories who are stuck on 33 per cent. Ant and Dec, speaking to the Times, said they followed politics 'keenly', but were disillusioned with Labour and the Tories. Mr McPartlin said: 'I voted Labour all my life. But last election I voted Tory because I was thoroughly disillusioned with the Labour government. 'Now I'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government. I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.' Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'

All article text:Animal rights activists were stunned when the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Feld Entertainment, announced it would eliminate elephants from its circuses by 2018. The elephants will then be retired to a conservation center in Florida. 'Monumental and long overdue,' was how the Animal Welfare Institute put it. 'Startling and tremendously exciting,' The Humane Society of the United States said in a statement. And the International Fund for Animal Welfare called it 'a giant step in the right direction.' But activists soon focused on the timing, questioning why it will take three years to phase out the elephants from the traveling circus shows. Elephants perform at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus said it will phase out its iconic elephant acts by 2018 . Just days before the announcement, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis (TB). TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read. Scroll down for video . Elephants with the Ringling Bros. show appear in front of the Capitol in Washington in 2013. PETA says the company's move to retire its elephants heads off a scandal about the animals having TB while touring . As many as one-third of the elephants having tested positive for tuberculosis, and several Ringling employees have been treated for the disease . Ingrid E. Newkirk, president of PETA, said: 'Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis, so their retirement day needs to come now' The documents obtained by PETA reveal that in 2010, at least 11 elephants with the circus tested positive for TB, and that elephants used by Ringling have had TB since at least 1978. As many as one-third of the elephants having tested positive for the disease, and several Ringling employees have been treated for TB. TB carried by an elephant was linked to an outbreak among eight humans at an elephant sanctuary, some of whom had no direct contact with the elephant. PETA said the documents also show that Ringling consistently opposed efforts by officials to improve testing requirements for TB in elephants. According to former USDA attorney Kenneth Vail, who is now the Animal Welfare Act compliance officer for Feld Entertainment, TB is 'probably going to be the downfall of Feld’s elephants'. Ingrid E. Newkirk, president of PETA, added: 'Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis, so their retirement day needs to come now.' 'If the decision is serious, then the circus needs to do it NOW.' Kenneth Feld (left), CEO of Feld Entertainment, and his daughters, feed elephants at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation, in Polk City, Florida . However, executives at Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, say it will take three years to build proper facilities for them on the 200-acre plot of land in central Florida that's already being used as an elephant conservation center. They have repeatedly denied that the elephants are mistreated in any way in the circuses. 'Each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area,' said Stephen Payne, Feld's spokesman, adding that permits, drainage issues and other logistics must be worked out. The company intends for the elephants to live out their years on the property, and since one elephant is 69, they must plan for the long haul to care for the crop of gentle giants. The decision to phase out elephants from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus comes at a time when cities across the United States are cracking down on exotic animal displays. Even before Thursday's announcement that the elephants will be phased out of Ringling's performances by 2018, company officials already said they were pulling out of certain cities because of newly enacted restrictions. Feld executives said the decision to end the circus's century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length. Elephants have often been featured on Ringling's posters over the decades. 'There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers,' said Alana Feld, the company's executive vice president. 'A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants.' Feld owns 43 elephants, 29 of which live at the company's 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida. One elephant is on a breeding loan to the Fort Worth Zoo. Thirteen animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018. The company plans to retire its remaining 13 touring elephants to its conservation center in Florida in 2018 . Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, say it will take three years to build proper facilities for all thirteen elephants to join the 29 already on site at the 200-acre plot of land . Each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area, and permits, drainage issues and other logistics must also be worked out before the elephants can retire to the center . Another reason for the decision, company President Kenneth Feld said, was that certain cities and counties have passed 'anti-circus' and 'anti-elephant' ordinances. The company's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year, and Feld said it's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction. It's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations, he said. Carol Bradley, who wrote a book about the freeing of an elephant, called the decision 'earth-moving' and thought the Felds would never change their minds . 'All of the resources used to fight these things can be put toward the elephants,' Feld said during an interview at the conservation center. 'We're not reacting to our critics; we're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the Asian elephant.' Carol Bradley, the author of the book 'Last Chain on Billie: How One Extraordinary Elephant Escaped the Big Top,' which is about a non-Ringling circus elephant, said she believes the Feld family 'realized it was a losing PR battle.' 'This is an enormous, earth-moving decision,' she said. 'When I heard the news, my jaw hit the floor. I never thought they'd change their minds about this.' In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal-rights groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year legal battle over allegations that Ringling circus employees mistreated elephants. The initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former Ringling barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $190,000 by the animal-rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit. The judge called him 'essentially a paid plaintiff' who lacked credibility and standing to sue. The judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial. Kenneth Feld testified during that trial about elephants' importance to the show. 'The symbol of the 'Greatest Show on Earth' is the elephant, and that's what we've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years.' When asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants, Feld replied, 'No, it wouldn't.' The circus will continue to use tigers, dogs and goats, and a Mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders joined its Circus Xtreme show this year. The symbol of the 'Greatest Show on Earth' is the elephant but Feld Entertainment now admits that the public is no longer comfortable with them touring with elephants, and keeping up with changing regulations is tough . The circus business is changing and Feld is now investing in more motor sports. In 2010 it created a motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz (pictured) and has acquired a number of other acts . More motor sports, daredevils and feats of human physical capabilities will likely be showcased. In 2008, Feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties, including monster truck shows, motocross and the International Hot Rod Association, which promotes drag races and other events. In 2010, it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz. Roughly 30 million people attend one of Feld's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year. Ringling's popular Canada-based competitor, Cirque du Soleil, features human acts and doesn't use wild animals. And while Ringling is phasing out the elephants, other, smaller circuses in the U.S. — and in countries such as Russia, France and Thailand — still use elephants. Feld owns the largest herd of Asian elephants in North America. It costs about $65,000 yearly to care for each elephant. Kenneth Feld said initially the conservation center will be open only to researchers, scientists and others studying the Asian elephant. He said he hopes it eventually expands 'to something the public will be able to see.'
