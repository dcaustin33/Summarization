All article text:Cuts of 20 per cent to the police budget by the Conservatives will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror, a retiring senior officer has warned. Sir Hugh Orde, the retiring president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), claims the 'tipping point' between cutting resources and staff and increasing the risk to the public is close. Since 2011 the Home Office reduced the amount spent on police by 20 per cent  and the Home Secretary Theresa May has said there will be further cuts if the Tories win the forthcoming election. Sir Hugh Orde, the retiring president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, warns that cuts to the police budget of 20 per cent, proposed by the Tories, will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror . One way some forces are reportedly going to try to operate on smaller budgets is by reducing the number of officers. Sir Hugh, who is due to stand down ahead of the creation of the National Police Chiefs' Council, told the Observer that taking police off the streets is a clear risk in the fight against extremism. He said: 'The critical element, it seems to me, with dealing with people who will start to behave differently in their communities is the confidence in that community to speak to the local cops. 'If the cops aren't there and that relationship has not been built we won't get the intelligence.' Asked directly whether police would have adequate resources to protect the public in the context of cuts, he said: 'In my professional judgement, the answer is no.' He added that cuts to other public services had put an increased pressure on the police, with officers having to fill in for ambulance crews and  those let down by depleted mental health care. Sir Hugh, who left Acpo two weeks ago, said while it is accepted police cannot be exempt from cuts, he questioned how much more the forces can take. He added that 44 police forces is too many and collaboration is important and cited the work of Sir Stephen House, chief constable in Scotland, who has brought together eight forces, where crime is at an all-time low. Yvette Cooper MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, said cuts would take spending back to 1930s levels and would sign the end of neighbourhood policing . Labour has claimed another 30,000 police officers could be lost if the Conservatives are returned to power in May. Almost 7,000 police community support officers could also be cut by 2020, Labour said,  after commissioning figures from the House of Commons Library based on trends during the current Parliament. Yvette Cooper MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, said:  'Conservative plans to cut spending back to 1930s levels would mean the end of neighbourhood policing. 'These figure show that under these extreme and risky Tory plans a further 30,000 police officers could be lost - the equivalent of almost the entire Metropolitan police force. 'This is on top of the 17,000 cut since 2010 and would mean police numbers falling by a third after ten years of the Tories. And it would mean we would have fewer than 100,000 police officers. 'More serious and violent crimes including child abuse, rape and domestic violence are being reported, the terror threat has grown, and there has been a massive increase in online crime.' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said his force had lost about 15 per cent of its grant, £600 million, in 12 months. It had managed to maintain police numbers by making savings in the back office - they had lost 3,500 staff and buildings had been sold. He told LBC: 'We have maintained the front line, so we are proud of that. Over the next few years, it is going to get very hard.' He said he feared that after the next government gets in, the force will lose another 15 per cent, a total of a third, or £1.4 billion. 'When we have to find that amount, numbers will drop,' he said. 'We will have less police, we will have to manage it. 'We have still got to invest in counter terrorism, if people out there are trying to kill us, we'd better do something about it, and that means a lot of hard work.' A Home Office spokesman said:  'Police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a fifth under this Government, according to the Independent Crime Survey for England and Wales. 'While we acknowledge that the police funding settlement is challenging, there is no question that the police will still have the resources to do their important work. 'What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total. 'The reduction in crime nationwide demonstrates there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided.' The spokesman added: 'Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has found that the police are successfully meeting the challenge of balancing their books while protecting the frontline and delivering reductions in crime.'

All article text:A toddler was left behind in the woods by nursery school staff after they took a group of children on a walk, it emerged today. Fordfield House Nursery has apologised unreservedly after the shocking failing in care was revealed in an Ofsted report. The youngster was only returned to the nursery - which caters for children under the age of five - after being found by someone from a nearby riding stables. Failing in care: A toddler was left behind in the woods by Fordfield House Nursery during a class outing . After the incident last December staff at the nursery in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, notified the inspector that a 'serious incident' had occurred. It is believed the child, whose age and gender is unknown, was left behind in woodland at the end of the trip to the woods. The nursery has stopped all outings until new policies are brought in - including giving staff new mobile phones. Ofsted would not confirm how the child came to be left behind but their report states they issued 'compliance action'. This included a 'notice to improve' which asked the nursery to 'ensure children are kept safe on outings'. A welfare requirements notice was also serves which states the nursery must 'ensure staffing arrangements meet the needs of all children and ensure their safety'. New measures: The nursery, pictured, has stopped all outings until new policies are brought in - including giving staff new mobile phones . It also states that they must 'ensure that children are adequately supervised and decide how to deploy staff to ensure children's needs are met'. It also asked them to 'identify the steps to be taken to remove, minimise and manage[...] risks and hazards'. Ofsted said it had also carried out a further inspection into the nursery and a report would be published 'in due course'. The report, which was published last month, said: 'The owner took immediate action following the incident. 'All outings have been stopped until relevant policies and procedures have been amended and fully implemented within the nursery. 'New mobile phones that will be used on outings have been purchased. We are satisfied with the action taken by the provider. The provider remains registered with Ofsted.' The nursery was in fact rated outstanding by Ofsted after an inspection last July and its director, Carole Cross, said parents had been 'kept fully informed'. She said: 'We made our parents and Ofsted fully aware at that time and they rigorously inspected the nursery and investigated. 'We complied and worked with the inspection team immediately and, as a result, we have put improved and effective changes in place to make our nursery even better than it was. 'We have apologised unreservedly to our parents.' A nursery spokesman said: 'The incident was last year and it has been fully investigated by Ofsted.' A mother who has three children at the nursery said: 'I believe that the incident should not define what is a wonderful establishment. 'The nursery responded in the appropriate way and rather than dwell, they have put measures in place to stop any such incident - a direct result of human error - from happening again. 'I only hope that this does not mean an end to the wonderful walks in the woods that my children have enjoyed with nursery over the last eight years.'

Du Xiutang put 300,000 yuan (£32,310) towards the project and asked friends and family to donate anything they could. The 53-year-old, from Yulin, China, still needs 300,000 yuan to complete the submarine, which has already taken nearly seven months to build, People's Daily Online reported. A farmer is building a submarine by hand after investing his life savings in the project. Above, the submarine after seven months of work . The self-taught former miner has finished building an escape pod and managed to install a power source. He even invented a hydraulic drainage and dual propeller system, which has been patented nationally. He is awaiting a periscope - but hopes he will be able to put the sub in the water this summer. Mr Du, who has had a life-long interest in mechanical design, said: 'When Russia sold China a retired submarine at a high price in 1992 I thought the Chinese people must make their own submarines. 'The most advanced submarines in the world cannot always be made by others. These thoughts motivated me all these years to succeed.' Some of the money has been provided by his son, who works in the welding factory where the submarine is stored.

All article text:An ally of the Russian opposition leader who was gunned down in Moscow has branded a theory that he was killed by a devout Muslim because he defended Charlie Hebdo's cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as 'absurd'. It emerged earlier today that police in Russia investigating the death of Boris Nemtsov were looking at theories that he was killed over his support for the French magazine, which published the controversial images. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov had said that Zaur Dadayev, one of the five suspects detained over the killing of Nemtsov was a 'deep believer' and was not happy by Mr Nemstov's supporting the magazine. Scroll down for video . Zaur Dadayev, who has been charged with involvement in the murder of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov inside a defendant's cage inside a Moscow court building . It has been claimed that Dadayev, pictured, is a devout Muslim, who was angry about the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in the French magazine Charlie Hebdo . The claims were made by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, pictured. Dadayev is a former member of the police in Chechnya . However, Ilya Yashin, who co-founded the opposition movement Solidarnost has now dimissed the theory, saying it was 'politically motivated'. He said: 'The official version of the inquiry is more than absurd. In my opinion it is the result of a political order from the Kremlin. He also added how Mr Nemtsov had 'never negatively spoken about Islam' and had merely criticised the Islamist extremists who gunned down 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January. Mr Yashin's comments come after Chechen leader Mr Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account: 'All who know Zaur (Dadayev) confirm that he is a deep believer and also that he, like all Muslim, was shocked by the activities of Charlie and comments in support of printing the cartoons.' He also confirmed that Dadayev had also been a member of the police in Chechnya and had been decorated for bravery. Mr Kadyrov is considered by many as one of Russian president Vladimir Putin's most loyal henchmen in the Caucasus region. He was installed by Putin as leader of Chechnya and has spoke of his support for Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Mr Nemtsov, 55, was shot four times in the back while walking along a bridge in full view of the Kremlin with his model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23. Three suspects detained over the killing of Mr Nemtsov sit covering their faces in a defendant's cage at a court in Moscow yesterday . All of the men were escorted from a bus to Basmanny district court, in Moscow, with their hands bound and masked men standing either side . An armed guard escorts one of the five suspects in the killing of Mr Nemstov into a court in Moscow yesterday . He had been a critic of current Russian president Vladimir Putin and considered a liberal. Yesterday, it was alleged Dadayev made a statement confirming his guilt as he and four other men appeared in court over the assassination. All of the men were escorted from a bus to Basmanny district court, in Moscow, with their hands bound in front of them and masked men standing either side. Once inside they continued to be flanked by armed guards and were forced to speak from a defendant's cage. The court heard that Dadayev, 33, served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, which is part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. His sister confirmed that he had won medals for bravery and courage. Judge Mushnikova added: 'Dadayev’s involvement in committing this crime is confirmed by, apart from his own confession, the totality of evidence gathered as part of this criminal case.' Anzor Gubashev, who worked for a private security company in Moscow, was named as another suspect. He denied any involvement. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's federal security service, said Dadayev and Gubashev were 'suspected of carrying out the crime'. It was not clear if either of the men were believed to have fired the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov.

At the time of his death Mr Nemtsov had been working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict . At the time of his death Mr Nemtsov had been working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict. He was also in the midst of organising a march against the war and had written a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and other politicians to alleged corruption. The shooting occurred a few hours after he had made a radio appearance denouncing Putin for 'mad, aggressive' policies in Ukraine. Surveillance footage apparently showed a man climbing into a white getaway car and being driven away. Russian officials have denied any involvement, with President Putin dubbing the murder a 'provocation'.

All article text:With its dramatic coastline and verdant hills, Ireland’s County Cork has long been a magnet for celebrities wanting a break from the limelight. American-born Irish dancer Michael Flatley has a home there, as does London-born Hollywood star Angela Lansbury, actor Jeremy Irons and film producer Lord Puttnam. Even the hard-drinking Oliver Reed used to retreat to the area for the occasional break from hellraising. But probably the most famous star to find a hideaway in County Cork is the queen of Hollywood romance, Maureen O’Hara, who has owned a spellbinding property on the coast for more than 45 years. Spellbinding: Maureen O'Hara's house nestles in the stunning coastal scenery in County Cork, Ireland . The movie legend, 94, has taken the painful decision to put the home, called Lugdine Park, on the market . Now, at the age of 94, the movie legend has taken the painful decision to put the home, called Lugdine Park, on the market and live full-time in the States. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have so many wonderful memories over these many years at Lugdine, and now it’s time to pass her on to another lucky family who will cherish her as much as I have.’ Once considered the world’s most beautiful woman, Dublin-born O’Hara is relocating to Idaho to live with her daughter Bronwyn. Lugdine Park, which was built in 1935, boasts five bedrooms, 35 acres of land and two private islands. It has wildly romantic views of the Atlantic Ocean and looks down on the harbour of the village of Glengarriff. It also has a guest cottage, outdoor changing rooms and WCs, and a private bathing beach. ‘I have the most wonderful neighbours a person can hope for in Glengarriff,’ she said. ‘We’ve been together for so long and love each other as old friends. Everybody has always been very respectful of my privacy if I want it, but I can’t wait to see everyone whenever I arrive. ‘Of course, I always get a chuckle when “lost” tourists happen to stumble upon my house in need of directions back to the village. ‘They always have their cameras with them ready to snap.’ Lugdine Park, which was built in 1935, boasts five bedrooms, 35 acres of land and two private islands . O'Hara made five movies with John Wayne, including Wings of Eagles (pictured) O’Hara’s big break came when she auditioned for a movie role in London, after she had studied at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. Oscar-winning actor Charles Laughton happened upon her screen test and was captivated by her expressive eyes. He recommended her for the lead role in Alfred Hitchcock’s British-made 1939 film Jamaica Inn. O’Hara – who was born FitzSimons but changed her name to O’Hara as it was shorter – received rave reviews for her debut role, despite the fact that the film was a commercial flop. It paved her way to Hollywood, where, with her alluring mix of red hair, refulgent green eyes and fiercely passionate attitude, she earned the title the ‘Queen of Technicolor’. She starred in The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, How Green Was My Valley, The Black Swan, Sinbad The Sailor and Miracle On 34th Street. She also made five movies with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man, in which Wayne played an Irish-born American returning to his homeland. She has been married three times, having her daughter with her second husband, the film director William Houston-Price. One place that has been a constant for her over the past half-century is her vast home in West Cork. She has a unbreakable connection to the people in the small community of Glengarriff and has been the honorary vice president of Glengarriff Golf Club, participating in and promoting tournaments, bringing thousands to the area and putting the small fishing village on the map. There has been many a famous visitor to her home too. ‘Ed Koch was a beloved Mayor of New York City and friend who did visit me at Lugdine,’ she said. ‘We had a wonderful time in our cosy village and he delighted everyone with his wonderful wit. He spent every morning gazing out the window at that magnificent bay, sipping his coffee. Price: €2.095million (approx £1.52million) Location: Glengarriff, Co Cork . Bedrooms: Five . Unique features: Home of Hollywood legend Maureen O'Hara, two private islands and private beach, 35 acres of land . ‘He said it was the perfect view to accompany his perfect cup of coffee. Everyone who visited, famous or not, always said it took their breath away, they loved the serenity of it.’ When asked for any advice for the next owners of her home, she said: ‘Greet everyone you meet with a smile and friendly hand and they’ll wrap their loving arms around you. It’s a lovely, lovely village filled with wonderful people who are so proud of this magical piece of heaven.’

All article text:Just a few months ago, Francis Coquelin was on the verge of being allowed to leave Arsenal, having made little more than a fringe impact on the club's first team. A loan at Championship side Charlton saw him play five games in the second tier this November and December, before Arsene Wenger recalled him following an injury to club captain Mikel Arteta. Coquelin was expected to be cover for Mathieu Flamini, and his first three games saw him play a total of 13 minutes, coming off the bench late in the game on all three occasions. Francis Coquelin has become a key member of the Arsenal first team after almost being allowed to leave . Statistically the Frenchman is the leading defensive player in the Premier League since his return to Arsenal . Coquelin's stint in the first team has earned him a new long-term contract with the Gunners . But an injury to Flamini has handed the 23-year-old Frenchman his chance, and Coquelin has emerged as a real talent, and a crucial part of Arsenal's recent good form. In fact, based on statistics alone, Coquelin is unquestionably the best defensive player in the Premier League since he returned to the club. Since his first start, in Arsenal's 2-1 win over West Ham on December 28, the holding midfielder has shown terrific reading of the game and positional sense, making more successful interceptions than any other Premier League player. Coquelin has also brought a degree of steel to the famously lightweight Arsenal midfield, topping the charts for Duels won. Arsene Wenger admitted he had expected to release Coquelin at the end of the season . Coquelin has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he's injured . Coquelin almost went on loan to QPR at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on . In fact, the French midfielder has dominated the Premier League in personal battles, his 97 duels won an astonishing 21 more than any other player. When it comes to tackling the Gunners' academy product is only second in the list, four behind Manchester City full back Pablo Zabaleta, but he is still comfortably ahead of the next best midfielder, Brazilian Fernandinho. As a result, Arsenal have lost just twice in the league since the turn of the year, and have climbed to third in the Premier League table, leaving some fans to ask whether Coquelin is the player the Gunners have been missing since the departure of Gilberto Silva. Certainly he is not yet the finished article, as shown in an unconvincing display against Monaco in the Champions League. The Frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot Mathieu Flamini in the pecking order . Arsenal have been linked with Christoph Kramer (left) and Lars Bender but might feel Coquelin is enough . Coquelin played five games on loan at Charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular . But Wenger, so long linked with a string of defensive midfielders - the most recent lists including Lars Bender, Christoph Kramer ad Morgan Schneiderlin - seems to think that Coquelin has a future at the club, offering him a new long-term contract last month. Whether he holds onto his place when Arteta returns, or can hold off competition from those potential summer signings, remains to be seen. But what is certain is that Arsenal have, statistically at least, found themselves the Premier League's leading defensive player on current form.

All article text:The heat is on and there are contrasting statements from some of the Premier League’s most prominent managers. Manuel Pellegrini loftily announces that he has no need to win trophies to keep his job at Manchester City. Brendan Rodgers openly admits that unless he had put Liverpool back in the running for honours he would have been sacked. Louis van Gaal urgently instructs his Manchester United players to minimise passes back to their goalkeeper in an attempt to pacify fans who are demanding a return to the attacking style of Sir Alex Ferguson. Manuel Pellegrini claims he does not need to win trophies to hold on to the Manchester City reins . Louis van Gaal has told his players not to pass back to keeper David de Gea to improve United's tempo . Roberto Martinez airily falls back on the support of his chairman Bill Kenwright as Everton drift, as if rudderless, towards the rapids of the drop zone. Get real, Senors Pellegrini and Martinez. Right on, Mister Rodgers and Meneer Van Gaal. Complacency has never been a recipe for security in the football management game and you begin to fear for Pellegrini and Martinez as the season heads towards the home straight. Pellegrini’s calm intelligence and fine football principles have won our admiration but he is kidding himself if he truly believes it when he says: ‘I’m not under any pressure to win titles. It’s about playing with style. We won’t change. It’s not about my relationship with the owners. They are not so desperate to win.’ Oh, really? Good luck with that one if after they spend so much money you come up short of Chelsea in your defence of the Premier League title and Barca finish you off in the Champions League. And it didn’t look that good against gallant Leicester on Wednesday night. Martinez comes across as honest – albeit painfully so at times – as well as a smooth media operator but he may be taking a little too much for granted when he says: ‘I was always aware of the support I would get from the chairman.’ Roberto Martinez has suffered second season syndrome at Everton with the Toffees perilously perched . Brendan Rodgers was candid about his chances of survival before Liverpool's remarkable turnaround . Beware the good old vote of confidence, Roberto, and let’s hope you don’t come to re-evaluate something else you’ve just said about Mr Kenwright: ‘Bill is a mad Evertonian.’ Fanatical fans are not usually very forgiving of only one win in a run of a dozen games including that tepid defeat at Stoke. Rodgers and Van Gaal, meanwhile, are sensibly watching their backs. Not long ago I had occasion to chide Rodgers in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a Liverpool team sliding into crisis. Since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3-4-3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the Premier League and he freely declares now: ‘I’ve learned that if the team is not functioning it doesn’t matter how much support you have in the boardroom. You have to win.’ So it’s well done to him. Since losing to United on December 14, Liverpool have won nine and drawn three in the Premier League . Van Gaal is proving himself shrewd enough to know that sometimes not even a run of only two defeats in 21 matches is enough at a club as huge as United. The Old Trafford faithful are chanting ‘attack, attack, attack’ while his raft of expensive imports – including £60million record signing Angel di Maria – are struggling to comes to terms with the quick-fire culture of the game in England. And the manager hears them: ‘I agree with the fans that we don’t have to use the goalkeeper so much. That there are times when we could play at a higher tempo.’ United are approaching a potentially season-defining sequence of matches against Spurs, Liverpool, City and Chelsea in the League and Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals and he promises: ‘We can improve.’ So it’s well done to him, too. This quartet are not the only managers sweating in the boiler room of big-time football. Heaven knows, for example, what poor old Gus Poyet was burbling on about in his bottle-kicking rant during Sunderland’s fractious draw at Hull this midweek. Or whether his sanity will hold up under the pressure of fighting to stave off relegation without his star England winger Adam Johnson following his arrest on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl. Angel di Maria trudges off to be substituted after another disappointing outing against Newcastle . Hull boss Steve Bruce and Sunderland's Gus Poyet played down their spat and have since shaken hands . The trapdoor is beginning to creak under some auspicious names. Don’t feel too sorry for them if it swings open. Unlike the great managers of yore – even Sir Alex was financially strapped in his early years astride the hot seat – these celebrities are paid millions to cope with the pressures. Like several of their more immediate predecessors, they would not necessarily be obliged to find another job after the pay-off. It’s mostly the pride that’s in danger of being hurt. There is one lesson above all others which England’s rugby goliaths need to heed from that Six Nations defeat in Ireland. Brawn alone will not be enough to win the World Cup this autumn, even on home turf. Stuart Lancaster’s pack is a monster, right enough, but you cannot simply shove, bore and batter your way to glory against the best teams on the planet in the Test matches which matter above all others. England will need more than a game based around brute force if they are to succeed in the World Cup . Ireland gave Chris Robshaw his men a lesson and the Red Rose will need to regroup - and add guile . You have to play some football, at least, when it comes to Ireland, probably France, even more so New Zealand. Sir Clive Woodward had Martin Johnson the Enforcer but he also got the sparkling best out of Jonny Wilkinson, whose phenomenal kicking blinded many to his creative talents. Lancaster has Chris Robshaw the Mighty. He also has at his disposal the mercurial genius of Danny Cipriani, who he leaves parked on the bench. There is no reward without risk. There was an awed reaction to my reminiscence earlier this week of how Tottenham’s late, great Dave Mackay refused to believe he had broken his left leg for a second time until he stamped his foot and the jagged white bone stuck out through his sock…then spurned the stretcher and insisted on walking off. So don’t be too surprised if this much loved and revered iron Scot arrives at the funeral on his own two feet. The late, great Dave Mackay is crowned by Spurs team-mate Jimmy Robertson after winning the 1967 FA Cup .

All article text:The family of Private Cheryl James, 18, pictured, died from a single gunshot wound to the head at Deepcut Army Barracks in Surrey in 1995 . A female soldier was subjected to sexual violence before her death at Deepcut Army base in November 1995, it has been claimed. Private Cheryl James was one of four soldiers who died of gunshot wounds at the base between 1995 and 2002. The 18-year-old recruit suffered a single gunshot wound to her head. An army investigation ruled that Pte James took her own life, while a coroner returned an open verdict just three weeks after her death. Now Pte James' family want a new inquest following the discovery of new evidence which could provide a different explanation for the tragedy. Last July, the family were successful being granted a new inquest, but the hearing his being delayed by Surrey Police. The family's legal team claim that new ballistics evidence as well as claims of bullying and sexual violence in the weeks leading up to Pte James' death. The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbigshire, north Wales died on November 27, 1995. She suffered a single gunshot wound to the head, with the bullet entering between her right eye and the bridge of her nose. Ballistics experts claim that it is highly unlikely that the bullet wound suffered by Pte James could have been self inflicted. Just five months before Pte James' death, Private Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, East Sussex was discovered with five bullet wounds to his chest. The army maintained that Pte Benton took his own life in June 1995, despite ballistics evidence suggesting that only one of the five rounds was discharged at close range. In September 2001, Private Geoff Gray, 17, from East London suffered two gunshot wounds to the head while on guard duty. Pte James was one of four young army recruits to have died at Deepcut Army Barracks, pictured . Doreen and Des James , pictured, want a new inquest to find out what happened to their daughter in 1995 . On March 23, 2002, Private James Collison, also 17, was found with a single gunshot wound to the chin. Once again the army insisted that another young recruit had taken their own life. Although the families of the dead soldiers believe that authorities are trying to cover up the real cause of the deaths. During the most recent hearing, Alison Foster QC told the High Court: 'We will present shocking details which will pertain only to this girl. Private Sean Benton . The 20-year-old of Hastings, East Sussex, was found dead at Deepcut with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995. Despite ballistics tests suggesting only one bullet was fired from close range and the others from a distance, the Army says he committed suicide. Private Cheryl James . The 18-year-old of Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a single bullet wound to her head at the barracks in November 1995. An Army inquiry concluded she committed suicide while a coroner records an open verdict three weeks after her death. Private Geoff Gray . The young recruit,17, from Hackney, east London, was found with two gunshot wounds to his head while on night guard duty in September 2001. Five shots had been fired and the other three bullets were not found. A coroner records an open verdict after hearing that a figure was seen running away from the area. Private James Collinson . The 17-year-old, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound upwards through his chin while on night guard duty at the barracks in March 2002. The Army says he killed himself, but his parents do not accept this, insisting he had been happy. An inquest in February 2006 recorded an open verdict . 'We will be looking at the circumstances surrounding Cheryl's death including ballistics, harassment and sexual violence towards her.' Pte James' family want to have their daughter's body exhumed for a new examination which they hope prove that the young recruit did not take her own life. The 20-year-long legal battle is being supported by Liberty. Pte James' family are anxious that the new inquest into their daughter's death is opened as quickly as is reasonably possible. But Surrey Police want the inquiry delayed as the families of the three other recruits may wish to reopen their inquests. Pte James had been stationed at the controversial Deepcut Barracks near Frimley in Surrey for just 11 days at the time of her death as part of the Royal Logistics Corps. She was found on November 27, 1995 at 8.30am near her guard post. The was armed with a standard-issue SA80 rifle. Surrey Police conducted their own investigation into the death which formed part of a 44-volume case file. It included statements, documents, notes, photographs and forensic evidence. Liberty successfully managed to force Surrey Police, using the Human Rights Act, to hand over the dossier, which is central to the latest legal bid. Emma Norton, Legal Officer for Liberty, said: 'Cheryl died in 1995. Surrey Police held onto all the sensitive material about Cheryl’s death, refusing to hand it over to the family until 2012 – and then only under threat of litigation using the Human Rights Act. 'The content of the disclosure is shocking and it was on the basis of that evidence that the High Court ordered a fresh inquest. 'After almost 20 years her case is finally ready to proceed. 'That it should now be Surrey Police – again – that is standing in the way of the investigation by asking for the case to be delayed is deeply upsetting to Cheryl’s parents.' An independent investigation into the four deaths published in 2006 found 'clear evidence of found abuse', 'institutional failings' and a 'culture of intimidation' at Deepcut Barracks. But the report, which had been commissioned by the Ministry of Defence found that Pte James and her comrades had not been 'bullied to death' and had probably taken their own lives. Last July, Mr Justice Mitting and Judge Peter Thorton granted permission for a new inquest into Pte James' death. After reviewing the most recent evidence, they agreed there had been 'an insufficiency of inquiry' during the 1995 inquest and quashed the open verdict. Judge Thornton added: 'The discovery of new facts or evidence made a fresh investigation including a fresh inquest necessary or desirable in the interests of justice.' A spokeswoman for Surrey Police said: 'Surrey Police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which Pte Cheryl James died. 'The Force continues to provide voluntary disclosure of documents relating to Pte James and has as a dedicated team to complete this as quickly and effectively as possible. 'At a pre inquest review on February 27th, His Honour Justice Barker was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of Pte Cheryl James, Pte Sean Benton, Pte Geoff Gray and Pte James Collinson, together or individually. 'This was raised as a matter for consideration and Surrey Police will fully support the coronial process. Our thoughts remain with the family of Pte James.'

All article text:A top health insurance expert with the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday that she doesn't know what portion of Americans who have left the ranks of the uninsured did it by buying policies on Obamacare exchanges. In a conference call for reporters, Office of Health Reform director Dr. Meena Seshamani boasted about new Gallup survey data that indicates 'the uninsured rate dropped from 20.3 percent to 13.2 percent' between the beginning of Obamacare's open enrollment and March 4, 2015 . That's less than a 35 per cent dent in the uninsured ranks. President Barack Obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on the promise of a medical insurance law 'that will cover every American.' And the 'reduction in the uninsured,' Seshamani said, 'could be through any of a number of avenues.' UNDERPERFORMING? HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell presides over an Obamacare system that has managed so far to change the status of barely one-third of America's uninsured . TAX BITE FOR MANY: Portions of about 4.5 million Obamacare insurance subsidies will have to be paid back this year . She listed a few, beginning with new coverage from empoyers – including among people who changed jobs – along with Medicaid and 'the individual market outside the [Obamacare] marketplace.' The question of how many American consumers have gained medical insurance through Obamacare marketplaces themselves has become a sticking point in the ongoing political battle over the controversial law. HHS reported Monday that '14.1 million adults gained health insurance coverage since the beginning of open enrollment in October, 2013.' Another 2.3 million 'young adults' under age 26 gained coverage through their parents' policies, an option that wasn't available to them previously. HHS Office of Health Reform director Dr. Meena Seshamani touted new Obamacare numbers but wouldn't say how many people have become insured specifically because of the law's marketplaces . But CBO estimates in January held that Medicaid, a taxpayer-funded benefit for the poor, enrolled more than 7 million new customers in the same period – nearly 43 per cent of the total HHS listed in Monday's report. The congressional bean-counting agency's latest estimates hold that the Affordable Care Act will cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years to administer and fund with subsidies. That's about $3,770 for every American man, woman and child. Monday's numbers came from HHS's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, which analyzed data collected through March 14 from a Gallup-Healthways 'Well-Being Index' survey. Dr. Richard Frank, the Office of Health Reform's assistant director for planning and evaluation, told reporters Monday that HHS has no idea how low it will be able to drive the uninsured rate, notwithstanding the president's campaign pledges. 'It's important to recognize that we're in entirely new territory here. ... We're treading new areas and we're just starting to understand more completely who we've brought in and who is left uncovered,' Frank said. Obamacare customers who receive government subsidies got some unrelated bad news last month with the revelation that more than half of them will have to give some of that money back when they file their tax returns. Research published by the tax preparation firm H&R Block found that typical subsidized Obamacare users owe $530 each because their subsidiies were calculated based on their 2012 income – and they earned more in 2014. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Feb. 9 that nearly 6.5 million people who live in the 37 states covered by its HealthCare.gov website would qualify for abn Obamacare tax credit this year since htey can't afford to pay the full price for medical insurance. That means nationwide more than 4.5 million will see part of their April 15 refunds shaved away, according to a Daily Mail Online analysis.

All article text:Stuart Lancaster has urged Twickenham to will England to victory on Saturday evening as he prepares to order his RBS 6 Nations title hopefuls to carry the game to France. Lancaster believes the noisy support of a sold-out 82,000 home crowd will have a critical role to play in edging rivals Ireland and Wales for Championship glory on a nerve-jangling final day of staggered kick-offs. England are favourites to lift a first piece of silverware under Lancaster and their head coach refuses to view the match through the prism of the looming World Cup on these shores. England scrum half Ben Youngs fires out a pass as Courtney Lawes and Joe Marler (left) watch on . 'It will be hugely important that the crowd get behind the team,' Lancaster said. 'If there's ever a day when we need the crowd to push us over the line and give us the momentum we need then it's Saturday. 'Whether we just need to get the win or win by 10 points or whatever it might take, the crowd will have a huge part to play. 'This game is not about the World Cup, it's about winning the Championship. And that's all it's about. It's about Saturday night only. 'Our mindset is to go and win the game. We can't play just to hang in there. We have to have a front foot mentality and have an intensity and tempo to our game from the first minute.' England fly half George Ford winds up a pass in training at his side's team base at Pennyhill Park . England head coach Start Lancaster has backed his side to handle the pressure of their final day shoot-out . England enter the final round of matches with a points cushion of plus four and having digested earlier results from Wales' trip to Italy and Ireland's visit to Edinburgh, their victory target against France will be made clear. The scheduling appears to have favoured England, but Lancaster insists providing the climax to the tournament creates its own challenges. 'I don't think we can be seen as favourites. I don't think anyone can. It will play out on the day,' Lancaster said. 'Whether the staggered kick-offs help us depends on what the other scores are. 'If we have to win by 20, psychologically if you concede seven points in the first five minutes and then a penalty, you then have to score 30. 'Psychologically it's an interesting dynamic for the players to manage. The danger is that sometimes you can want to chase the game too early rather than build the score. 'It's an 80-minute game. Knowing that is one thing, but dealing with everything that's around it puts incredible pressure on the players. The England squad gather for a huddle at the end of their training session as Lancaster looks on from afar . Former France No 8 Imanol Harinordoquy insists all the pressure will be on England on Saturday . 'On the staggered kick-off times, we all know the rules when we start. It makes it exciting.' Lancaster has made one change to the starting XV, promoting lock Geoff Parling at the expense of Dave Attwood, who drops out of the 23 altogether, with Nick Easter recalled to the bench. Attwood has started all four matches of the tournament but misses out on the final instalment with Lancaster believing the street-wise Easter is a better option to reinforce the final push for silverware. 'When you boil it down, it's the experience that Geoff brings. He didn't go on the Lions tour by accident, he's a high quality player,' Lancaster said. 'Dave is a very good player who has lots of qualities, but Nick will make a stronger impact from the bench and that's why the decision was made. 'Dave understood the decision. There were performance reasons as well. It wasn't just done because of Geoff. There are areas of Dave's game we've been asking him to improve on. 'It was a difficult conversation but ultimately done on a performance point of view. Dave accepted it and knows the areas he has to work on.' England have finished runners=up for the last three years running with points difference alone deciding the 2013 and 2014 tournaments. When asked if he was fed up at finishing second, Lancaster said: 'Yes! It would be nice to win this time.'

Mesut Ozil believes he will one day be crowned as the world's best player by winning the Ballon d'Or . The Arsenal midfielder hopes he can 'continue to develop and stay healthy' in a bid to win the coveted award .

'I’m feeling very positive. I’m a world champion and I play at a top club in the Premier League. 'There is much more of a physical test here than there is in Spain or in the Bundesliga – I constantly have bruises, but that makes me harder. I feel physically better than ever.' The 26-year-old, who is currently on international duty with Germany, hit the headlines for the wrong reasons last weekend after being spotted in a Berlin nightclub just hours after missing Arsenal’s Premier League victory against Newcastle because he had a cold. Ozil has had a turbulent career at the Emirates but has rediscovered his form since the turn of the year . The 26-year-old is currently on international duty with World Cup winners Germany . Germany manager Joachim Low defended Ozil, claiming the midfielder had the permission of Arsene Wenger to fly to Berlin on Saturday. 'It's anyone's guess whether he was partying or not,' Low told reporters ahead of Wednesday's friendly against Australia. 'He has told me that he was in Berlin. I spoke to him and he said that he was weakened by a cold during last week and so Arsene Wenger and Ozil together took the decision to not play him at the weekend. After the match, he was allowed to fly to Berlin.' Ozil was spotted in a Berlin nightclub just hours after missing Arsenal’s clash against Newcastle on Saturday .

The Mercer County prosecutor's office says authorities executing search warrants Thursday in Trenton and Bordentown found the reptile living in the basement of a house. Animal control officers were called to the scene on Poplar Street in Trenton and removed the baby crocodile. Nabbed: Alexander Green (left), 35, and Dawud Joyner (right), 34, were arrested in New Jersey as part of a drug bust, which also netted a baby crocodile . Exotic contraband: The small reptile was found in the basement of this home on Poplar Street in Trenton . Along with the scaly critter, authorities found marijuana. Two men, identified as Alexander Green, 35, and  Dawud Joyner, 34, were arrested on a slew of drug charges. The search warrants of the five homes yielded more than 100 grams of ecstasy, two guns and more than $2,000 in cash. A car also was seized. Authorities say Green was the target of the three-month investigation by the prosecutor's office's narcotics task force, which culminated in Thursday's raids. According to prosecutors, just before 4pm Thursday officers executed search warrants at five addresses on Poplar Street in Trenton and Ward Avenue in Bordentown. In all, the drug bust yielded a .380 caliber semi-automatic handgun, a defaced .38 Special revolver and a black ski mask stashed inside an oven, as well as bags of marijuana, ecstasy and drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale and baggies . Rescued: Animal control officers arrived on the scene and removed the crocodile (pictured here is a stock image) The baby crocodile was discovered inside the basement of 43 Poplar Street where Dawdud Joyner lived with Richelle Ayers. Both were arrested on drug charges and outstanding warrants. A 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix was also seized by officials as drug proceeds. Lt. Mike Novembre, the commanding officer of the operation, said the estimated street value of the seized ecstasy was $3,180, while the value of the marijuana was $750. Alexander Green has been charged with multiple drug and weapons possession counts. He is being held on $150,000 bail.

Yesterday, a distraught Philip Bramley visited the monument erected near where the Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed. His son was one of three Britons who lost their lives. Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on Tuesday, Mr Bramley said: ‘What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don’t want it to be forgotten, ever.’ He added: ‘I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children’s lives in their hands. 'I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.’ Many people took to Facebook to offer Ms Tiirik condolences in response to the photo she posted, with one friend saying ‘he was the best guy you could ever meet’. Emotional appeal: Philip Bramley, whose 28-year-old son Paul (seen in the photograph) was one of three Britons on board the ill-fated Airbus A320, said the 150 who lost their lives should 'not be forgotten' Grief: Speaking at a memorial near the crash site in the French Alps, Mr Bramley (centre) fought back his tears as he talked about his son, who was returning from a short holiday in Barcelona on the doomed flight . Tribute: Paul Bramley told Sky News that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 'ill' and his motivation for deliberately downing the plane was 'irrelevant'. Above, Mr Bramley holds a photo of his son at the victims' memorial . Ms Tiirik, who is from Estonia, replied: ‘Thank you! He was. It is a big loss for everyone. How it can [sic] be that the most lively and positive person there ever was can be taken from us in this way... I just don’t understand.’ Mr Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with Ms Tiirik. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days’ holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family.

All article text:(CNN)A teenage Australian jihadist suspected of having carried out an ISIS suicide attack developed a hatred for the West over the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, before settling on radical Islam as a vehicle for "violent global revolution," according to his purported blog. Jake Bilardi, an 18-year-old student from Melbourne, appears to have documented his path to radicalization and his experiences in ISIS-held territory in a blog, titled "From the eyes of a Mujahir: An Australian Mujahir in the land of the Khilafah." The blog has been deleted, but a cached version remains available online. CNN could not independently verify the blog's authenticity, but the biographical details detailed on the blog match Bilardi's. One of the final posts on the blog, which is credited to "Abu Abdullah al-Australi," purports to have been posted on January 13, as the author was "preparing to sacrifice my life for Islam in Ramadi." The Australian government said Wednesday it was working to confirm reports that Bilardi had carried out a suicide attack on behalf of ISIS, after the terror group claimed an "Abu Abdullah al-Australi" had been killed in a car bombing during an offensive in the city of Ramadi. The claims were made along with a picture that appeared to be of Bilardi, referred to as "Abu Abdullah al-Australi," apparently prior to carrying out the mission. The blogger describes having a "very comfortable" upbringing as the youngest of six in the Melbourne suburbs, where he was raised an atheist, excelled in his studies and "dreamed of becoming a political journalist." He describes how his older siblings educated him on various subjects, and how his brother's instruction on international politics held a special resonance for him, particularly after the September 11 attacks. "Being just five years old at the time of the attacks ... my knowledge of the operation was basically non-existent. Despite this, I was immediately drawn to the topics of al Qaeda and 'Islamic terrorism'," he wrote. "It was from here that my research into al Qaeda ... and groups with similar ideologies worldwide began. I spent every day researching online and reading the books I had begun collecting." The blogger writes that it was his reading on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and abuses committed by occupying forces, "that gave birth to my disdain for the United States and its allies, including Australia. It was also the start of my respect for the mujahideen that would only grow to develop into a love of Islam and ultimately bring me here to the Islamic State." Eventually, he wrote, he came to view democracy as "nothing but a system of lies and deception," one which "focuses heavily on providing the people with so-called freedom" but "throws celebrities and false reality into the spotlight to distract the people from what is really going on in the world." The wars "signaled the beginning of my complete hatred and opposition to the entire system Australia and the majority of the world was based upon," he wrote. "It was also the moment I realised that violent global revolution was necessary to eliminate this system of governance and that... I would likely be killed in this struggle." While the blogger said he had come to the conclusion that democracy was "something that can only and must be destroyed by violent revolution," he wrote, he "was never quite sure" what should replace it. "Socialism? Communism?? Nazism???" he wrote. Eventually, as his interest in jihadist groups deepened at about the time of the Arab Spring, he settled on Islam. "It was Islam that for me stood out as easy to understand and was shockingly consistent with established historical and scientific facts," he wrote. Following a stretch in which he turned his back on his growing extremist beliefs, which he described as "one of the most shameful periods of my life," the blogger wrote that he began to try to find a contact to help him join Jabhat al-Nusra or Ahrar al-Sham, two Islamist groups fighting in Syria. His attempts were unsuccessful. While he had initially rejected ISIS after "falling for the many lies being spread against them," he wrote that he began speaking to their members online, and, after witnessing their military successes, developed a desire to join the group. Eventually, he managed to find a contact who promised to get him into ISIS territory. Worried that his plot to leave Australia might be foiled by authorities, the blogger wrote that he developed his "Plan B," collecting materials for what he envisaged as a "string of bombings across Melbourne, targeting foreign consulates and political/military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centers and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar." Victoria police confirmed Wednesday that chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device had been found in a search of his family's home in the Melbourne suburb of Craigieburn. The blogger wrote that he abandoned his plans for an attack in Melbourne after realizing that buying bomb-making chemicals could draw the attention of authorities and ruin his bid to join ISIS. He did not reveal how he had been able to enter ISIS territory, but said that on entering the ISIS-held Syrian city of Jarablus, he "felt a joy I had never experienced before." In another blog post, entitled "Being white in the Islamic State: The abolition of racism" he wrote approvingly that the "Islamic State has been successful in eliminating racism and in building the world's only true multi-ethnic state." He said he signed up for a "martyrdom operation," or suicide attack, in Baiji, Iraq, which failed, before registering to undertake another in Ramadi, where he was "waiting for my turn to stand before Allah." Clarke Jones, an expert on radicalization at the Australian National University, said that Bilardi "blew away the profile of what most people think of when they think of people who are going to support the Islamic State." White and middle class, reportedly bullied at school and vulnerable following the loss of his mother to cancer, he more easily fit the profile of a school shooter than an Islamic terrorist, he said. "What it does show us is that there are a whole range of profiles," he said. Bilardi's aunt has linked the teen's troubles to the loss of his mother, while a former classmate at Melbourne's Craigieburn Secondary College described him as shy. Jones said Bilardi's case was also notable in that he did not appear to have been "groomed" by terror recruiters -- indeed, he wrote of initially struggling to make contacts among Islamic extremists -- and had radicalized himself through his own readings. "The PM here said Jake was brainwashed -- I don't think he was brainwashed. He was very calculated in what he did and documented it quite clearly," said Jones. In one of the blog posts, the blogger says that the warm welcome he and other foreign fighters had received in the Islamic State disproved "the Australian government's laughable claim that we are used as 'cannon fodder'." But Jones said his Bilardi's ultimate fate in a suicide mission was typical for foreign fighters in his position. He believed that in knowingly signing up for this fate, on two separate occasions, Bilardi had been seeking the kind of recognition and achievement that, as a vulnerable teen, he had been denied at home. "He wanted that 'religious prize'," he said. CNN's Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.

All article text:Everton midfielder Ross Barkley accepts his form this season has fallen below his best but insists he is not feeling the pressure. The 21-year-old's fortunes on the pitch have mirrored that of his team as neither have been able to reproduce the standards of last season, when a brilliant campaign saw the Toffees finish fifth after being in contention for the Champions League for a long period. Barkley has struggled to rediscover the form which made him such an integral part of the team's success but he is working hard to get back to his best. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley has admitted he has failed to replicate last season's performances . Barkley, pictured scoring against Newcastle, has netted just two goals so far this season . 'From my point of view I haven't done as well as I know I can, but things like this happen,' said the England international. 'You have to go through bad days to get to the great days you have in your career. 'Everything's a learning curve. We haven't been going through the best period at the moment but we're going to come through this and be really good at the end of it. 'I don't feel pressure. I believe in myself and I know what I can do. It's not me feeling pressure, it's just me putting pressure on myself if I don't do my best, and I know I can do better. The 21-year-old (right) is expected to start against Italy after coming on in the second half against Lithuania . 'I just focus on getting better every day, putting things right in training and then hopefully what I'm doing right in training I'm going to show in games as well.' Barkley, when he has started, has found himself switching positions regularly and has not been given a long spell behind the centre forward where he was most effective last season. Many observers appear to have pencilled him in for a deeper midfield role but he does not feel that will get the best out of him. 'I'm a striker,' he said. 'I feel I can have my greatest impact there because I'm free to roam around the pitch, take players on, have shots and create chances.'

All article text:Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has changed his mind over his side's main aim this season as the Dutchman is now prioritising Champions League qualification over winning the FA Cup. Van Gaal, who has been criticised during the course of the season for constantly tinkering with Manchester United's tactical approach, said back in February that winning the FA Cup was his side's main objective. The Dutchman, speaking after Manchester United's 3-0 win against Cambridge United on February 3, said: ‘We have a real chance now. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal appears to have changed his mind over his side's main priority . Van Gaal, pictured after United's win against Newcastle, is focused on Champions League qualification . United are currently fourth in the Premier League . ‘Why? We are the highest qualified team in the FA Cup so people are maybe betting on us. I am not allowed to (bet), I am not a casino man – but I give you a tip. ‘Of course, I think the highest qualified teams have more possibilities to win than lower qualified teams. But Arsenal is still in the cup and Liverpool will fight tomorrow (Wednesday, February 4). ‘For me, personally, I have always won a title in my first year everywhere I have worked so the chance of winning the title is bigger in the FA Cup than the Premier League. ‘Every club in the FA Cup wants to win, and so do we. For the club, the fans and the coach and my staff, we want to win a title this year. The biggest chance is the FA Cup, but we still have to win four games to do that.’ Van Gaal, pictured after winning the Bundesliga in 2010, previously said his main aim was to win a trophy . However Van Gaal, speaking ahead of his side's quarter-final clash against Arsenal, now insists finishing in the top four is more important than winning a piece of silverware. Van Gaal said: 'I always want to get the goals what we have set. And the goals we have set is the top four. 'A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League. 'I think that for a club the Champions League is the highest level. To finish in the first four is a fantastic result, I think. And for us, Manchester United, more I think.'

All article text:Evergreen Paul O'Connell can still scale new heights ahead of notching his 100th Ireland cap in Saturday's pivotal RBS 6 Nations showdown in Wales, according to Sean Cronin. Veteran lock O'Connell will equal Mick Galwey's record as Ireland's oldest captain of all time at exactly 35 years and 145 days at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. The Munster talisman will become just the fourth star to hit 100 Tests for Ireland, joining Brian O'Driscoll, Ronan O'Gara and John Hayes in the century club. Sean Cronin believes veteran Paul O'Connell (above) still has a long career ahead of him . Leinster hooker Cronin hailed O'Connell's 'intensity and physicality' as the crux of Ireland's relentless pursuit of ever-higher standards under taskmaster boss Joe Schmidt. 'It's a phenomenal achievement: I think he's getting better with it even as the years go on,' said Cronin, as Ireland look to home in on a second Grand Slam in six years this weekend. 'But he's the kind of player that, whenever he's playing, he nearly makes you play better because that's the enthusiasm, the passion, the physicality that he brings. 'He kind of instils that in the players around him, it's great to play under him. 'He sets the standard and you've got to get up there with him. 'He'll demand it off you one way or another, so it's great to play with a person like that, because it raises your standards as well.' O'Connell will equal Mick Galwey's record as Ireland's oldest captain of all time on Saturday . O'Connell will stride past a multitude of milestones in Cardiff this weekend, as he aims to mark his 50th Six Nations performance by setting Ireland a new winning Test run of 11 matches. Wales and Scotland block Ireland's path to Grand Slam glory and a third career Six Nations crown for O'Connell. As the teams complete preparations in the Millennium Stadium's bowels this weekend, O'Connell will launch into a trademark tub-thumping team talk. Cronin acknowledged the legend around O'Connell bringing team-mates to tears with his unbridled pre-match passion - but admitted the Munster stalwart's rhetoric far more fearsome than emotive. The 35-year-old is put through his paces during an Ireland training session at the Kingspan Stadium . 'I've nipped out a couple of times to dot the eyes during his talks!' joked Cronin of myths O'Connell can invoke raw emotions. 'No, but seriously, he scares me more than makes me cry to be honest with you. 'He brings a certain level, you see him doing it, his intensity, physicality, attention to detail. 'So when you see him doing that, you're saying to yourself 'I need to get to that as well'. 'If 15 or 23 lads get to that level, we're hard to beat. 'He's similar to Joe (Schmidt) in some ways. 'Paul isn't going to get to the heights of Test rugby that he has without hard work and accuracy. 'He's got great influence on the squad, the lads buy into that and he's fantastic to have around.'

All article text:Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is promising an exciting summer of recruitment at Selhurst Park after the club effectively guaranteed their Premier League survival with a comeback victory at Stoke City. Palace are now 11 points clear of the drop zone and Pardew can think about building for next season, buoyed by the new Sky Sports TV deal and a possible takeover from American businessman Josh Harris. Recruitment is now uppermost in Pardew’s mind and he revealed: ‘We are getting calls regarding players from Inter Milan and Benfica because they are our market now. Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Stoke 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium . Pardew (left) congratulates wing wizard Yannick Bolasie at full-time after Palace's impressive victory . Wilfried Zaha has scored in his last two games against QPR and Stoke, the first time he’s netted consecutively since October 2012 in his first spell with Palace . ‘Palace now come into the same group as everybody below the likes of Everton, Tottenham and Liverpool, and the most important thing is to try to trade well. ‘It’s important to preserve your Premier League status early. If you leave it late, it is very difficult to get players. You don’t want other teams putting packages together and working on players before you can. ‘We are pretty secure in approaching clubs and players now as a Premier League side for next season and that’s what we will do. We have the finance to do what we say we are going to do. So it does give us a slight advantage.’ One player who will remain is reborn winger Wilfried Zaha who scored the winner at The Britannia for his first back-to-back goals since 2012. In February, Wilfried Zaha (right) was sad, but according to Alan Pardew he is now playing with a smile . Zaha signed for Manchester United after Palace's promotion, but his career nosedived at Old Trafford . Zaha’s career nosedived after a £15million move to Manchester United went sour and he has gone from being capped by England to not even making the Under 21 squad. He was ordered to smile more and sulk less by Pardew last week and celebrated his goal at Stoke by playfully sticking out his tongue. ‘He looked a sad player when I arrived (from Newcastle in January),’ said Pardew. ‘You are never going to play your best football when you're sad and sometimes good management is not about tactics but inspiring players. He was down in the dumps for whatever reason. ‘Young players need that exuberance, particularly with the way he plays. And smiling and being happy is part of that exuberance.’ Nonetheless, 22-year-old Zaha doesn’t plan on transforming himself into a cartoon clown. ‘I do smile when I need to!,’ he stressed. Crystal Palace players celebrate with Glenn Murray after he scored a penalty to draw Palace level . Stoke manager Mark Hughes was distraught with two key decisions by referee Andre Marriner . ‘When it is time to be serious, I’m serious. When it is time to play around I will play around. ‘We’ve got the points we’ve needed to now so we can play without pressure and enjoy the rest of the season.’ There wasn’t much hilarity from beaten Stoke manager Mark Hughes who felt his side were robbed by two key decisions from referee Andre Marriner after taking a 14th-minute lead from Mame Diouf. Hughes has joined West Brom manager Tony Pulis in saying technology should be brought in immediately to stop the wrong decisions being made. The Stoke boss was furious that Mr Marriner awarded Palace a penalty when Asmir Begovic and Yannick Bolasie collided and Glenn Murray levelled from the spot. And after Zaha had put Palace ahead, the official waved away a strong appeal for handball against Palace defender Joel Ward. Hughes believes that Palace defender Joel Ward (right) was guilty of handball in the penalty area . Hughes slammed the standard of refereeing in the Premier League this season . Hughes said: ‘It was clear to everybody that he has thrown his body, his arms to stop the ball going goalwards. It was a shot on target, he was not close to the ball, he was about five yards away so it was a clear penalty. ‘I don’t think the standard of refereeing this year has been as good as it needs to be. They need a little bit of help and I’m an advocate of TV replays. ‘I think it is quite simple. If a big decision is made, he needs to ask the question: is there any reason why I should not give a penalty, or why I should not give a goal. Within 10 or 15 seconds they can give the referee an answer and there will be more correct decisions. They need to be given that option because at the moment they need a lot more help. ‘I think we have reached a tipping point. Before there were debates one way or the other but now I think it needs to come in.’
