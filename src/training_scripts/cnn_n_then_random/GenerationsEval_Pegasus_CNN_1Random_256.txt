Article text: Helsinki Airport has become the first in Europe to offer sleeping pods for worn-out travellers who are looking to catch a little shut-eye between flights. Each cocoon-like pod is an ergonomic seat which can be transformed into a bed, with a retractable cover designed to block light and noise. Users can store their hand luggage under the seat and charge their laptops or mobile devices by using a built-in power source. The GoSleep pods were designed and manufactured by Finnish Short Rest Solutions Ltd with the aim of taking some of the stress out of travel. Heikki Koski, Vice President at Helsinki Airport, said: ‘We wish to provide passengers with an opportunity for stress-free travel and a nap between flights. The GoSleep pods were designed and manufactured by Finnish Short Rest Solutions Ltd . Each cocoon-like pod is an ergonomic seat which can be transformed into a bed, with a retractable cover . ‘Helsinki Airport has many transit passengers, who may not have had any sleep for a day or are suffering from jet lag. I believe that the service will have genuine demand.’ While most airports offer comfortable chairs with little privacy, Helsinki Airport tested the pods in a specially-designed rest area in 2013. The pods were such a hit that the airport decided to purchase nearly a dozen of the chairs and scrap the relaxation area. Officials at Helsinki Airport said they have had positive feedback from passengers . Jussi Piispanen, CEO of Short Rest Solutions Ltd., said: ‘The pilot project showed that passengers prefer individual sleeping pods to larger rest areas. ‘Sleeping pods have aroused wide-spread interest in particular on gate 18, where they are available for testing for free during the spring. ‘Based on customer feedback, we will continue to refine the service to make it even more customer-friendly.’ Helsinki Airport tested the sleeping pods in a specially-designed relaxation area in 2013 . Officials at Helsinki Airport said they have had positive feedback from passengers since the programme quietly launched in mid-February. Last year, the website SleepinginAirports.com ranked Helsinki Airport as the world’s third most sleep-friendly hotel, behind Singapore Changi Airport and Seoul’s Incheon International Airport. In addition to individual sleeping pods in two public areas, Helsinki Airport offers a book swap for passengers, a free art gallery and free wifi. It is also planning to open 70 new or renovated shops as part of a €900million (£650million) development programme with the goal of boosting its annual passenger volume to 20million in 2020.

It’s because we are hypocrites.’ He went on to claim that too often, the English are lazy in their assumptions that problems which affect other countries do not exist in their own, saying: ‘Our policemen are wonderful, provided you’re white and middle class and don’t take to the streets. ‘And dying in custody is what happens in South America. It doesn’t happen here.’ He added: ‘A memorable phrase in Hamlet, and one of the few that hasn’t been picked up as a quotation or a title for something else, is when Claudius is arranging for Hamlet to be arrested and executed when he gets to our shores. As part of his explanation, the writer says that policeman in England are wonderful, 'provided you're white and middle class and don't take to the streets' (file picture) And in his letter he says; “Do it England”. And we say we do it, or we’re going to do it, but we don’t. Scotland does it. And Wales. But not England.’ He was careful not to exempt himself from his own criticism, saying: ‘Before you stampede for the Basildon Bond, or rather skitter for the Twitter, I must say that I don’t exempt myself from these strictures. How should I? I am English, I am a hypocrite.’ In January the World at One heard nominations from the Prime Minister David Cameron and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband and other party leaders.

Article text: A jury awarded Marvin Gaye's children $7.4million on Tuesday after determining singers Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams copied their father's music to create Blurred Lines, the biggest hit song of 2013. Vanilla Ice: While Vanilla Ice remains a one-hit wonder, that hit, Ice Ice Baby, still receives massive play over 20 years after it was released by the rapper. The song clearly borrowed however from the David Bowie and Queen tune Under Pressure, something the rapper initially denied. The case was eventually settled out of court, and the details of the settlement were never revealed, though it is known that Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon and Bowie all now have songwriting credits. Bright Tunes Vs. George Harrison: In the biggest copyright infringement case prior to Tuesday's ruling, Harrison was accused of using the Ronnie Mack song He's So Fine in creating his solo song My Sweet Lord. The case dragged on for five years, ultimately making its way to a United States federal court, where Harrison lost and was forced to pay $1,599,987, a staggering amount at the time. Isley Brothers Vs. Michael Bolton: Bolton used elements of the Isley Brothers song Love Is a Wonderful Thing in his song of the same name, and as a result ended up having to pay $5.4million, when the case went to court, which before Tuesday was the largest amount ever awarded in a copyright infringement case.

Article text: London (CNN)The BBC producer allegedly struck by Jeremy Clarkson will not press charges against the "Top Gear" host, his lawyer said Friday. Local versions have been made in the United States, China, Russia, Australia and South Korea. After his suspension by the BBC, Clarkson changed his Twitter profile to "I am probably a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear." On Wednesday, the wording became past tense: "I used to be a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear." Co-host Richard Hammond tweeted: "Gutted at such a sad end to an era. We're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride together." On Friday James May also tweeted, saying: "I've written some blues lyrics: Oh I woke up this morning, And ... #Still Unemployed." Fans had earlier expressed outrage at the BBC decision to suspend Clarkson. An online petition to have Clarkson reinstated has been signed by more than a million people. Fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired. Last week, a fan dressed as the "Stig" -- the anonymous racing car test-driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the BBC's London headquarters in an armored tank to present the "Bring Back Clarkson" petition. Clarkson later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times. While Clarkson's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers, his on- and off-air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense. Last year, he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n-word in a clip that wasn't aired. "I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure. I was mortified by this, horrified. It is a word I loathe," Clarkson said in video statement posted online. He's been accused on other occasions of racism, including characterizing Mexicans as "lazy and feckless" and using the word "slope" over footage of an Asian man crossing a bridge during a "Top Gear" special in Myanmar. Producer Andy Wilman later apologized, calling it a "light-hearted word play joke," and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to Asians. Last week, Clarkson launched into an expletive-filled rant at a charity auction in north London, verbally attacking his BBC bosses. A CNN reporter who was at the event said Clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show, saying the BBC had "f**ked themselves" and had ruined a great show. Clarkson later brushed off the incident, saying the rant was meant "in jest" and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the "Top Gear" race track.

Article text: Budget supermarket chain Aldi is stepping it up a notch by launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear. Budget supermarket chain Aldi is stepping it up a notch by launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear. The company reckons its £80 jacket and £60 trousers, made from 'high-standard' textile designed to protect against abrasion, are the cheapest in Britain. And they are certainly a bargain compared to the prices of brand leader Weise Avance, whose motorcycle jacket and jeans retail for £1,219.98 altogether - the jacket for £639.99 and trousers for £579.99. Aldi is launching of a new range of affordable motorcycle gear, with this whole outfit costing just £180 . The range of clothes that includes a trousers, boots for £29.99, motorcycle tank bags at a bargain £12.99 and gloves at £19.99,  is sure to be snapped up in minutes when it's released on March 8. The store will also sell thermal under layers including a long-sleeved top and long johns. And not only are the clothes a much more affordable option for motorbiking enthusiasts, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. The pass zone for the Level 2 impact abrasion test is seven seconds of abrasion resistance in body zones 1 and 2, which include the shoulders and elbows. Aldi's jacket and trousers exceed these requirements, achieving over 13 seconds of abrasion resistance across all four zones of the garment. John Chatterton-Ross, of Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), the governing body for motorcycle racing, said: 'This is the first time I've seen a UK retailer selling a motorcycling jacket and trousers of this high standard at such low prices. Not only are the clothes an affordable option, but they also passed the safety test with flying colours. Pictured: High-standard textile jacket, £80 . 'The protection offered by Aldi's products exceeds the requirements for impact abrasion and impact cut resistance demanded by the European standard for zones 1 and 2 in all zones. 'Few products on the market can match this. Often, even in premium brands, it is only the protectors that are certified, not the rest of the garment. 'It is great to see that with Aldi's motorcycling jacket and trousers, safety does not have to come with a high price tag.' The motorcycling range comes after a whole host of specialist ranges launched by the supermarket - from Equestrian and fishing gear, to yoga and even ski clothing and accessories. And just last June, the chain even brought the world's most expensive beef, Wagyu, to its aisles at £6.99 for a sirloin steak. John Chatterton-Ross, of Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme it's 'the first time I've seen a UK retailer selling a motorcycling jacket and trousers of this high standard at such low prices.' Pictured: Gloves, £19.99 . Tony Baines of Aldi said of the new range: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone'. Pictured: Touring boots, £29.99 . Normally, luxury stores, gourmet butchers and food websites sell the beef for the equivalent of an eye-watering £100 per kilo - putting it out of reach for most families. The move to offer luxury food and clothing at discount prices is part of a wider drive to attract middle and upper income shoppers away from the 'big four' - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Tony Baines of Aldi said: 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer something for everyone - giving our customers the opportunity to stock up for less without compromising on quality. 'The motorcycling range is of no exception and we're proud of the level of safety we've achieved at this unbeatable price point.'

Article text: Hong Kong (CNN)Nestled in a tranquil hillside, Hong Kong's newest Buddhist monastery features bulletproof VIP rooms and the world's second tallest statue of the Goddess of Mercy -- a Buddhist deity. Li initiated the project in 2003 to promote Buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete. At a height of 76 meters (250 feet), the Goddess of Mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong's harbor and several islands. The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms. One of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect "important guests." "We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks," Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. The rooms are still empty, and Ngai added that they were not designed for Li or any specific individual, reported the South China Morning Post. Visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks, meat, alcohol, or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly --- instead the monastery will provide water. "There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks," Ngai told local media. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery. It will be open to the public on April 15, but registration and booking is now available online. CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.

The leading segment was intended as a serious discussion about the announcement by the BBC that Jeremy Clarkson’s contract would not be renewed following a ‘fracas’ with producer Oisin Tymon. Miss Maitlis interviewed Alan Yentob, the BBC’s creative director and presenter of arts show Imagine, about the decision. Mr Yentob’s remarks on the programme were also criticised as elitist. One viewer tweeted: ‘Why is Emily Maitlis dressed as if she has escaped from the sets of St Trinian’s, refusing to play the extra.’ Another added: ‘Of course we all adore Emily Maitlis almost as much as she adores herself but isn’t the ravaged St Trinian’s schoolgirl look a tad de trop?’ A third wrote: ‘Emily Maitlis is wearing a strange outfit this eve, part off duty city boy, part pirate.’ This is not the first time the journalist’s wardrobe has drawn comments. In 2012, she was compared to a Sontaran – an alien from Doctor Who – after anchoring BBC News while wearing an unconventional collar.

Article text: (CNN)Brace yourself Europe -- "Moneyball" is coming to a football pitch near you. The American has said in the past that it was his dream to be an executive at a football club once his baseball career ended.  It turns out he didn't have to wait that long. "I think it's interesting and exciting for him personally," said Chris Anderson, co-founder of the sports analytics consultancy Anderson Sally. "He's been a football fan for many, many years and is very well informed about the sport and industry. This is not as much a stretch as one might imagine; he actually knows football." Beane will retain his general manager duties with the Oakland A's, a team that remains competitive despite sporting one of the lowest payrolls in Major League Baseball (MLB). The A's have qualified for MLB's playoffs each of the past three seasons, only to be knocked out before the World Series every time. Critics of baseball's sabermetrics system -- using data to analyze the sport as exposed in Michael Lewis' "Moneyball" book which inspired the film -- are quick to point out that Beane has never won a title with the A's. In Holland, Beane won't need to start from scratch, as AZ currently sits comfortably in fourth place in the Dutch Eredivisie. AZ's director of football Earnie Stewart is a known "Moneyball" fan himself, having organized a screening for his fellow AZ execs shortly after joining the club. The former U.S. midfielder, who scored against Colombia in the 1994 World Cup, is half-Dutch and hopes the collaboration with Beane can give the club an extra edge. "We've had a lot of contact with Billy In the last few months", Stewart told the club's website. "His knowledge and ideas are impressive. Also Billy's soccer network is excellent. We have already noticed that Billy thinks two steps ahead in the area of innovation. That's what really connects with the ambitions of AZ." Like the A's, AZ have managed to compete with the big boys of the Dutch league -- chiefly PSV and Ajax -- on a limited budget, winning the domestic league twice -- most recently in 2009 -- while finishing in the top five in three of the past five seasons. Beane's philosophy is shaped by getting maximum bang for your buck in the transfer market. "There is a misconception that you never pay much for anybody, but that is not true at all," Beane told the Telegraph in 2011. "You want to make sure you are getting more value than you are paying. That may come in the form of a very expensive player, it may come in the form of a very young player, but it's not about being cheap or not spending money." But it's questionable whether "Moneyball" principles can be applied to football, a sport where -- unlike in U.S. sports leagues -- players are rarely traded for one another. Instead, athletes are sold for prices determined by a marketplace, untethered by salary caps. However, Anderson argues Beane could be about to exploit a gap in the market. "I would say unequivocally that markets for players are much more inefficient in soccer than in baseball," said Anderson, who also wrote "The Numbers Game: Everything You Know About Football Is Wrong." "The combination of a global market plus inefficiency means that is a huge opportunity in soccer that there isn't in the same way in baseball." Either way, Beane is likely to relish the challenge of imparting his knowledge to the boardrooms of European football, perhaps even as a pre-cursor to a full time job in the sport. "I think he certainly would be open to the possibility of taking on a role," said Anderson, adding that Beane could be using the advisory position to dip his toe into the shark-infested waters of football player transfers. "In football we're still in a pre-'Moneyball' era," added Anderson. "So the baseball equivalent of the mid-1990s. is the football equivalent of 2015."

I feel like my daughter is next to me – that's the feelings I have.' Thousands took to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, which was criticised for ridiculing Islam.

Article text: Today, the government will release the information that will affect our spending over the next 365 days, leaving Brits tightening their belts accordingly. And since 2008, new brands have now started to dominate the luxury market like Michael Kors, whose handbags and watches are now a go-to for semi-affordable luxury. The introduction of brands like this has pushed up the average price of a handbag among Britain's wealthy shoppers. The average value spent on a handbag by these shoppers currently sits at £248.96, with US brands Michael Kors, Tory Burch and Marc by Marc Jacobs inspiring most purchases. Coat budgets are also rocketing thanks to the trend for 'statement coats' in the last few years. While most of us would face a dilemma over whether to spend £70 on a new piece of outerwear from Topshop, the moneyed classes spent £250 on average on a new coat last year. This is predicted to increase by 27 per cent this autumn, with shoppers spending £286 on their next winter coat. Now recession is a distant memory, spending on clothes has risen fast (picture posed by model) The summer doesn't bring much relief either, with the expected spend on a new bikini rising to £205. Kalpana Fitzpatrick, founder of MummyMoneyMatters.com said: 'When it comes to spending money, women may well be splashing the cash on designer or high end fashion brands, but women are also better at saving. 'Time and time again, studies have found that women hold the purse strings when it comes to managing the money at home and they are also better at saving and budgeting than their partners.” 'However, although the recession may be a distant memory, many households are still struggling with finances and have not yet achieved a level of comfort they were in pre-recession – so it’s important that people continue to save and budget wisely.'

Article text: This is the heart-warming moment two young African elephants locked trunks in a touching embrace that was caught on camera. We moved out to a safer distance - about 50 metres (164ft) - away when one of the younger bulls, about eight years of age, started chasing a younger bull. The heart-warming moment occurred as a herd of nearly 30 elephants playfully chased each other and rolled around on the floor . ‘What we first thought to be aggression, turned out to be all playfulness. ‘Soon a number of younger bulls and cows started to play around. They pushed, head butted and rolled onto each other for quite a few minutes. ‘Soon after, it looked like they were embracing each other, with gentle touches to the faces with their trunks.’ Jacques Matthysen, the game reserve's photographer, said the elephants' affectionate behaviour caught him by surprise . He said two of the elephants locked trunks like humans would hold hands. ‘I quickly focused my camera on them, to capture the “loving” moment. ‘I am very happy with the sighting and images. This just shows us how these giants, that can be so dangerous and so aggressive, can in fact be so gentle and loving animals.’

Article text: Mark Halsey, the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular BT Sport pundit following Premier League upset, has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level. The network, happy to employ the more volatile Roy Keane as a football pundit, have had no contact with Moore. BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore vented his frustration at being snubbed by ITV on Twitter . Van Praag bid blunder . FIFA presidential candidate Michael van Praag says, if elected, he intends to cut costs — something he’s never heard mentioned during six years of dealings with Zurich, where figures are just plucked out of the air, he claimed. Van Praag will also declare what his FIFA salary would be and wants to know what Sepp Blatter has been paid. The Dutch football leader, who has a budget of €400,000 from his national association for his campaign, is also concerned at the way Fox TV were given the rights to the World Cup in 2026 without a tender to end their resistance to a World Cup in Qatar. Yet all Van Praag’s good intentions are undone by his open offer to Blatter, who he says could carry on as a working honorary president concentrating on the Goal Project funding. Meanwhile, Portuguese contender Luis Figo is rich enough to fund his own campaign but this most charismatic of footballers couldn’t be more dull when he talks FIFA politics. Michael van Praag, pictured with Louis van Gaal in 2014, has said he will cut costs if he replaces Sepp Blatter . Blatter is said to be so confident of winning a fifth term that he feels no need to mount any form of campaign and is addressing the UEFA Congress on Tuesday in his FIFA president’s slot rather than as a candidate. However, the 79-year-old is understood to have engaged well-known Swiss PR figure Klaus Stohlker to advise him on his election strategy. Stohlker, former TV journalist and political author, founded his own PR and consulting business in 1982 and is a long-time friend of Blatter’s. FIFA president Blatter is confident of beating off competition from the likes of Van Praag to win a fifth term . For all the shenanigans, scandals and infighting at the FA over the years, at least there’s never been such an unseemly episode as Germany’s FIFA executive member Theo Zwanziger reporting his successor as German federation president Wolfgang Niersbach to FIFA’s ethics committee over alleged pay and pension irregularities. It is a blatant attempt by Zwanziger to stop Niersbach taking his executive seat. FIFA have cleared Niersbach and UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said Zwanziger’s claims had been fully rejected, adding: ‘It’s all a bit embarrassing for him and sad for German football.’ Niersbach said: ‘I have not heard of a similar story anywhere in football.’ Theo Zwanziger (left) reported Wolfgang Niersbach (right) to FIFA's ethics committee over pay irregularities .

Lancaster’s team face a tense afternoon as championship rivals Wales and Ireland play before they do . Defeat in Ireland dashed hopes of a clean sweep this year, but Hartley suggested that securing a title — which would earn the home players a share of a pay-out worth in excess of £2million — in front of a full house at Twickenham would be ‘lovely’. He added: ‘It would be the best achievement in an England shirt, no doubt. All we can worry about is winning the game and letting everything else take care of itself. Our fate is still in our hands. If we get it all right and win well, I don’t think other results will matter.’ Forwards coach Graham Rowntree acknowledged that England could ‘do with winning any championship, any trophy’ and believes a home team containing several novices can handle the high stakes. ‘We’ve got full faith in the guys,’ he said. ‘I think we’ve shown calmness and leadership. We trust the lads’ decision-making.’ England hooker Hartley is eager to secure a title in front of a full house at Twickenham . Hartley was a member of the side under Martin Johnson who claimed the trophy in 2011 .
