Article text: Usain Bolt is putting in the hard yards ahead of a busy summer on the track as he builds up to the world championships in Beijing, as shown in his latest post of his training regime on social media. Bolt explodes out of the blocks in the baking sun and drives a few steps before slowing up in the post accompanied by an inspiration quote from one of his heroes Mohammad Ali. Usain Bolt gets primed for a starting drill during training in Jamaica ahead of a busy summer of competition . 'I hated every minute of training, but I said, “Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion”,' Bolt’s social media profile said with the vine video. After missing the majority of last season due to injury, the 100 and 200 metre world record holder is leaving nothing to chance in 2015. He’s locked in dates in Paris where he’ll run in the 100m on July 4 and the following week at the Athletissima Diamond League in Switzerland where he’ll compete in the 200m. The later event is one which hold special significance for Bolt who has said he’s keen to attack the elusive 19 second mark – his world mark stands at 19.19. The six-time Olympic gold medalist explodes out of the blocks in this Instagram post on Thursday . Bolt posted the video on social media with a quote he could relate to from boxing great Muhammed Ali . In an interview with Sportsmail’s Matt Lawton last month Bolt outlined his aim to become the ‘greatest sportsman ever’ and emulate his heroes including Ali, Michael Jordan and Michael Johnson, whose 200m mark he overtook. His major target in the short-term is the world championships in Beijing in in August. But Rio de Janeiro and his bid to win a third consecutive treble in the 100m, 200m and 4x100 relay is the holy grail. Just – and in Bolt’s case it is just – winning a third 100m title would put him in the history books.

Article text: Liverpool host rivals Manchester United on Sunday as both teams look to take another step towards securing a place in next season's Champions League. But if you needed the perfect warrior centre-half to combat Fellaini, Martin Skrtel would be high on your list. The shaven-headed stopper is fearless and as hard as nails. He knocked himself out making a challenge in an FA Cup tie against Blackburn earlier this month. Martin Skrtel (left) will need to deal with Marouane Fellaini's (right) height and physical presence on Sunday . JORDAN HENDERSON vs MICHAEL CARRICK . Different type of midfield players but whoever gets the upper hand could have a decisive influence on the result. Henderson is all about energy and mobility and scored the winner at Swansea City on Monday night. Carrick’s range of passing is outstanding, he gets the other United players on the ball at the right time. Both are vice-captains of their club and rivals in Roy Hodgson’s England squad too. Jordan Henderson (left) and Michael Carrick both play in the centre of midfield but they have different styles . DANIEL STURRIDGE vs PHIL JONES . Both players were tipped at one time to be the future of English football and are on the way back after injury. If Sturridge’s stealth and trickery win out, Liverpool will fancy their chances. But Jones is strong and will try to outmuscle the striker. Both have been named by England in the squad to face Lithuania and Italy and will be keen to show they are back to their best. Daniel Sturridge (left) will be looking to bamboozle Phil Jones (right) with his pace and trickery at Anfield .

Article text: A prototype of the highly-anticipated Tesla Model X has apparently been seen cruising around California. Switching from vehicles powered by fossil fuels to plug-in equivalents would ease a phenomenon called urban heat island, it said. The term describes what happens when city temperatures are driven higher by heat from traffic and air conditioners and by warmth, stored during the day in roads and buildings, which is released at night. The researcher's simulation was based on the weather in the Chinese capital in the summer of 2012, when the city was three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the surrounding countryside. Switching vehicles to electric would have caused this to fall by 0.94 C (1.7 F), according to their model. 'Heatwaves kill, and in terms of climate change, even one degree can make a difference,' said Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University, who took part in the study. Earlier this year, a video emerged of the Model X doing handling, braking and acceleration in a private lot. The Model X is expected to weigh around 10 per cent more than the Model S, but will share 60 per cent of its parts. Tesla claims the performance model will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in about 4.4 seconds. Last week, the California-based company revealed two key software updates for the Tesla model S sedan and the Model X that he claims will end 'range anxiety'. The first is a 'range assurance' app that communicates with Tesla's Supercharger network, warning drivers if they are about to run out of power, and pointing them to the nearest Supercharger. The second is a trip planner, which will combine the Supercharger network with the network of Model S cars to improve long-distance journeys for drivers. Other features that will be coming soon include the addition of autosteering for the Model S, which should be available in the next three months. The technology means drivers will not have to control the wheel, acceleration and braking when the car is on a the motorway. In the future, the company will also give driver's the ability to summon their car to any location.

Article text: If you've ever given blood, you'll know that even the most skilled nurses and doctors can struggle to locate the vein first time. It can then project a high-definition image of the veins onto the surface of the skin. The device enables doctors and nurses to find a vein immediately . The medical system was designed by Memphis-based company Christie Medical Holdings. It shows a picture of your veins directly on your skin’s surface, ‘hopefully saving you from the unnecessary pain of multiple needle stings,’ said the company. The device attaches to a movable arm that can be wheeled into position, to keep it steady while observing a patient’s arm. It works by emitting near-infrared light, which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood and then reflected by surrounding tissue. The information is processed digitally by the unit, and projected in real-time onto the skin. VeinViewer works by emitting near-infrared light, which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood and then reflected by surrounding tissue.

It can see patterns up to 0.6 inches (15mm deep), and veins up to 0.4 inches (10mm) deep. A fine detail mode also increases the contrast in the image, bringing out more detailed vein formations. This can allow a clinician to find turns in a person's veins, called bifurcations, and valves. The user can also take up to 200 static images of patient vasculature - the arrangement of blood vessels in the body. ‘Only VeinViewer can provide pre, during and post-access benefits throughout the entire vascular access procedure,’ said Christie’s president, George Pinho. ‘It is also the only device of its kind that has been shown through clinical studies to increase both first-stick success and patient satisfaction by up to 100 per cent while reducing medically unnecessary [catheter] lines by over 30 percent.’ A fine detail mode also increases the contrast in the image, bringing out more detailed vein formations. This can allow a clinician to find turns in your veins, called bifurcations (shown), and valves . In other tech-related hospital news, a company last month unveiled 'Robear', pictured above. It has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example. It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms. Robear was developed by the Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human-Interactive Robot Research in Nagoya, Japan.

Article text: How refreshing it was to see Danny Welbeck properly celebrate scoring for Arsenal against former club Manchester United on Monday night. How refreshing it was to see Danny Welbeck properly celebrate scoring for Arsenal against former club Manchester United on Monday night. The striker's passion was clear to see as he bounded backwards across the Old Trafford turf, letting out a roar of celebration as Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla rushed over to celebrate the moment. 'The emotion takes over,' he said afterwards. 'It was difficult to keep it in.' Quite right too. Welbeck had every reason to celebrate and let all that pent-up frustration out. A pumped-up Danny Welbeck celebrates his winner for Arsenal at former club Manchester United . The Arsenal striker celebrates with team-mates Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla after scoring . At United since the age of eight, he was booted out the door in the summer by Louis van Gaal, who claimed he wasn't good enough to be a first team player at United. So, on his first return to Old Trafford, Welbeck had a major point to prove and when Antonio Valencia under-hit a back pass to goalkeeper David de Gea, he seized his chance. Skilfully taking the ball around the Spaniard, he passed it into an empty net before celebrating whole-heartedly but still with plenty of respect for the United fans. Welbeck could certainly teach these players, who took the whole not celebrating against a former club thing a little too seriously. Shaun Wright-Phillips (Chelsea vs QPR, January 2013) Wright-Phillips wasn't wanted by Chelsea. They spent £21m to sign him and then kept him as a bit-part player until finally ditching him three years later having wasted the best years of his career. So when the winger earned Queens Park Rangers an improbable win at Stamford Bridge during their 2013 relegation struggle, with his first league goal in nearly three years, you'd expect him to be thrilled. Nope. Wright-Phillips looked downright miserable, an island of indifference as his team-mates celebrated jubilantly around him. Shaun Wright-Phillips (third right) looked downright miserable after scoring for QPR at old club Chelsea . Adam Johnson (SUNDERLAND vs Manchester City, December 2012) Likewise with Johnson, who had great expectations when he joined Manchester City from Middlesbrough in 2010 but was barely given a chance by Roberto Mancini. Indeed, Johnson revealed when he escaped to Sunderland that he was barely on speaking terms with the Italian manager towards the end, having been dropped without explanation on a number of occasions during a turbulent two-and-a-half years. So when Johnson gained his revenge by scoring the winner against City a few months after leaving, you'd expect something a bit more animated than just a raised hand of apology. Adam Johnson consoles his former team-mate Joe Hart after scoring against him in December 2012 . Romelu Lukaku (West Brom vs EVERTON, September 2014) Opening your account for a new club, especially after a £28m move, should be kind of a big deal. But Lukaku looked embarassed that his maiden goal for Everton had come at West Brom, the club where he spent the 2012-13 season on loan from Chelsea. Still, at least he earned an appreciative round of applause from the Hawthorns crowd for his sheepish raised hand 'celebration.' Lukaku holds his hands up after scoring for Everton against West Brom, where he spent a year on loan . Jonjo Shelvey (Liverpool vs SWANSEA CITY, February 2014) Shelvey made 47 league appearances for Liverpool over the course of his three seasons there, scoring two goals. Hardly the stuff of Kop folklore. But the midfielder felt the need to apologise to the Anfield crowd after scoring a lovely 20-yard goal on his return there with Swansea last year. It did earn him a round of applause from the Liverpool fans though. Jonjo Shelvey apologised to the Kop after scoring for Swansea at former club Liverpool .

Article text: It's normally women accused of high maintenance beauty routines and spending hours to get ready. He said: 'My hair is curly, so if I'm, going somewhere on my own, not a work event, I will run the straighteners over it. I also use coconut oil as a moisturiser. 'You can do anything with it - eat it, cook with it, use it on your skin. It's fantastic.' Who hogs the bathroom in this house? Part of Peter's morning routine involves preheating his steam shower for an hour while he drinks a cup of coffee in silence. So when does fiancée Emily MacDonagh (right) get her turn? Then, comes the agonising decision of what he's going to wear each day. Picking an outfit the night before just isn't an option for the popstar. Instead, Peter needs to walk into his wardrobe and pick out clothes which match his mood for the day. 'I could pick out a million things the night before, but if I wake up and I don't feel as good as I did the day before, I won't want to wear any of it.' In contrast, British model and It girl Alexa Chung has said she can be up and out of the house in a mere seven minutes. British fashion icon Alexa Chung may give everyone style envy on the front row, but the model claims her daily 'getting ready' routine takes her a mere seven minutes. Pictured: Alexa Chung attends the Prada show during the Milan Fashion Week last month . Talking to STAR magazine,the front row regular said, 'In real life, it's around the seven-minute mark. But for fashion week, I try and put in a bit more of an effort.' For Alexa Chung however, more of an effort means just three minutes added to her normal routine. Compared with Peter's painstaking grooming process, Alexa's final Fashion Week regime takes her a maximum of 10 minutes. Fashion Week ready in 10 minutes or less? It girl Alexa claims that to get ready for big events like sitting front row at Fashion Week, she needs just an extra three minutes of preening time.

Article text: Tim Sherwood says Aston Villa are ready for the home straight and wants to avoid a photo finish in the relegation battle. The boss takes his Barclays Premier League thoroughbreds to Sunderland on Saturday for a crunch clash. The Black Cats are a point and a place ahead of fourth-bottom Villa, who themselves are just three points above the drop zone. Tim Sherwood hopes the Premier League relegation battle does not end up being a photo-finish . And with the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday, Sherwood is hoping Villa, who have never been relegated from the Premier League, can avoid being unseated. He said: 'I think it'll be a photo finish and I hope we're not in it. 'We're probably just coming around the corner but it's probably the longest run-in in racing history. 'All we're looking at is the next fence and that's Sunderland. After that we hope we can stay in the running. There might be a few who fall along the way and we're hoping that's not us.' Villa have won their last two under Sherwood, beating West Brom twice in the league and the FA Cup to reach the semi-finals. They were the new manager's first wins since replacing Paul Lambert in February and Sherwood has been impressed with the squad's attitude. 'They've been good and a win makes an awful lot of difference. They have been focused and up for the fight,' he said. 'They haven't dwelt on the position. It's about looking forward now, what we have done previously counts for nothing.' Sherwood, before becoming head coach, was at Tottenham as assistant first-team coach under Harry Redknapp and worked with Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe at White Hart Lane. The 32-year-old returned to England in January after a year with Toronto in Major League Soccer and Sherwood believes Defoe is the Black Cats' chief threat. He said: 'If they are going to survive it's going to be Jermain Defoe who keeps them in the Premier League, that's why they forked out that sort of money for him. 'He didn't have to go, he went for a lifestyle change to Canada but he still has that appetite to come back and play for Sunderland, in a relegation battle. 'Jermain can score goals on his own but he prefers people to slide the ball across the six-yard box for him to be in the right place at the right time, that's what he's done all of his career.'

Article text: (CNN)India's highest court has reversed a controversial law that gave the authorities sweeping powers to arrest and potentially jail people for comments posted on social networks and other Internet platforms. Mahapatra called the charges a misuse of the law "in the name of surveillance, to curb democratic rights, freedom of speech and human rights of common people." A year earlier, Delhi went one step further with its digital crackdown when the so-called "intermediary guidelines" implicated web platforms themselves. The rules now require Internet companies to take down any content seen as "disparaging," "blasphemous," or "defamatory" within 36 hours of a user submitting a formal request for removal. In Mumbai, India's financial center, police spokesman Dhananjay Kulkarni told CNN in February that some 650 posts and pages were blocked last year under these regulations. Google says in the last half of 2013 it removed 540 items from its pages in compliance with orders issued by Indian courts, government agencies, and law enforcement. It's a similar story with Facebook. The social networking site took down nearly 5,000 pieces of content reported by the Indian government in the first half of 2014. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh and Kunal Sehgal in Delhi, as well as Mackenzie Sigalos in Hong Kong contributed to this report.

Article text: Boston (CNN)The defense in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rested Tuesday afternoon after presenting only four witnesses. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday. The defense case lasted less than two days, while the prosecution presented more than 90 witnesses over the course of a month. Federal prosecutors rested their case Monday with grisly testimony about how the bomb Dzhokhar Tsarnaev placed near the marathon's finish line tore through the bodies of 8-year-old Martin Richard and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old grad student. A second bomb placed by Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, killed Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. The short presentation in the sensational trial wasn't surprising, given that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorney, Judy Clarke, acknowledged during opening statements that "it was him," referring to her client's culpability. Testimony ended with an FBI fingerprint investigator who talked about numerous pieces of evidence with Tamerlan's fingerprints and not Dzhokhar's. Earlier, a computer expert testified about computer searches on Tamerlan's computer -- including gun stores, transmitters, fireworks firing system, detonator and Boston Marathon -- in the weeks before the bombing. Similar searches were not found on Dzhokhar's computer. Jurors first will be asked to determine whether Tsarnaev is guilty of 30 counts. Because 17 of those counts carry the death penalty as a possible punishment, a second phase of the trial will follow if the jury convicts him. In the penalty phase, jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors, such as the heinousness of the crime, versus mitigating factors, such as Tsarnaev's family history and his youth. He was 19 at the time of the bombings. The defense, which began calling witnesses Monday afternoon, has argued that Tsarnaev, known to friends as Jahar, fell under the sway of his more extremist older brother after their parents moved back to Russia. Jahar Tsarnaev was flunking out of the University of Massachusetts and had lost his financial aid at the time of the bombings. Prosecutors William Weinreb, Aloke Chakravarty, Nadine Pellegrini and Steve Mellin presented witnesses who told the story of Tsarnaev's alleged scheme with Tamerlan to build and detonate pressure cooker bombs as an act of jihad. The brothers, Muslims of Chechen descent, allegedly sought to kill Americans at an iconic public event to retaliate against U.S. policies they believed harmed and oppressed Muslims abroad. Prosecutors delved into Tsarnaev's text messages and Twitter posts and showed jurors militant material found in his laptop, phone and iPod. They included writings available online from top leaders of al Qaeda. They used data mined from a GPS device and store receipts to trace the purchase of the pressure cookers, BBs and ammunition. Jurors saw photos of pressure cooker parts, fuses, Christmas lights and other bombmaking materials found in the Tsarnaev family's Cambridge apartment, where Tamerlan lived with his wife and child. And they showed security surveillance videos of the brothers in the crowd near the finish line: In one, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can be seen blending in with the crowd behind the Richard family for four minutes. He appears to slide a backpack off his shoulder near a tree and walk off, glancing over his shoulder. He broke into a run as the bomb went off. After the surveillance photos were released to the public three days after the bombing, the brothers allegedly embarked on a desperate -- and deadly -- attempt to escape. Jurors heard from carjacking victim Dun Meng and saw the brothers on convenience store surveillance video shortly before Meng's escape. He can be seen jumping out of his leased Mercedes SUV at a gas pump and running across the screen as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev casually strolls through the store, picking up an armload of snacks. Prosecutors also used ballistic evidence to link the brothers to the shooting of a campus cop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gunbattle with police in Watertown. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died as a result of that gunbattle. The defendant, allegedly attempting to run down police, instead ran over his brother in the stolen Mercedes. Jurors also viewed a boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sought refuge during the ensuing manhunt, which put Boston under a "shelter in place" lockdown. He used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called his "manifesto" on the sides of the boat. It was pocked with bullet holes and streaked with blood. He wrote he was jealous that his brother had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior in the gunbattle with police. He asked God to make him a martyr, too. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty, although his attorneys do not dispute that he participated in the bombings. Clarke asked jurors in her opening statement to keep their minds open to an alternative explanation. The defense began its case with two witnesses called to offer scenarios that differ from the version of events offered by FBI witnesses. One focused on the the defendant's Twitter posts a year before the marathon, including mundane matters such as whether he should sleep in or get breakfast. Another challenged the way the FBI used GPS points and store receipts to document the purchase of pressure cookers, BBs and ammunition -- allegedly by Tamerlan Tsarnaev. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this story.

Article text: Two weeks of pent-up angst erupted during a full-throttle training game as England prepared to take out their frustration on Scotland. ‘We wanted to put the starting team under pressure so that they get used to making decisions under pressure and the more you can replicate that in training, hopefully when the game comes around, it comes easy.’ Lancaster conceded that England needed to clear the air with a no-holds-barred session. What he also needed was to see some of his fringe squad operating at that intensity, so he paid close attention to Exeter centre Henry Slade and Bath’s cross-code recruit Sam Burgess. Lawes has been reinstated in the second row at the expense of George Kruis and he confirmed that training yesterday had been combative. ‘It was tough,’ said the Northampton lock. ‘The boys were certainly up for it, which is what you want going into a game like this. You need to be on edge. It showed out there that we were certainly up for it at the weekend.’ This is not music to Scottish ears.

Article text: The University of Washington is investigating allegations that fraternity members made racial slurs and obscene gestures to black students as they marched past the fraternity house during a protest. Several students from the University of Oklahoma chapter captured here on video performing their racist song say they've received death threats . The fraternity's chapter president, Michael Hickey, says Sigma Alpha Epsilon has investigated and believes the slurs came from nonmembers. The Seattle Times reports he says it's working with others to hold them accountable. Meanwhile, attorney Stephen Jones tells CNN that some of the fraternity brothers at the University of Oklahoma, who's racist chant caught on tape started investigations into the fraternity's background, have received death threats since the recording was released. Still others, he said, had been physically assaulted.

The Black Student Union has asked the fraternity for an apology and plans to seek sanctions against it from the body that governs the university's fraternities. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was closed this month after video surfaced showing members engaging in a racist chant. Jones is not representing the two expelled members. While he agrees there is 'no justification for what occurred. Zero,' he says the members still deserve due process and to have their first amendment rights protected. 'We are committed to following the due diligence and protocols that we have set forth in our fraternity laws,' says the national SAE office, 'as they are designed to enable us to make deliberate, thoughtful decisions that reflect our commitment to our standards and to our members.'
