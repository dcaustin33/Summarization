Article text: Darrick Guider, 39, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is accused of having sex with a 10-year-old girl and getting her pregnant . Darrick Guider, 39, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is accused of having sex with a 10-year-old girl after she moved into the home he was staying at with her grandmother, who was his girlfriend. The young girl said that the first time it happened she was watching television when Guider walked into the room and told her 'this is how you make money.' According to NBC 13 the girl then said in court documents she tried to scream for her grandmother, but Guider covered her mouth. This happened shortly after she had moved to the home around June 2014. The young girl finally told her grandmother that Guider had been 'messing with her' in December, but the woman did not believe her. Then, in January, the grandmother took the young girl to the pediatrician, who told her she needed to take the girl to the hospital, which the grandmother did not do for reasons that are not known at this time. Finally, in March, the girl's mother realized she looked pregnant and took her to the hospital where it was revealed she was due at the end of May. Abortion is illegal in Wisconsin after 24 weeks, even in instances of rape. Guider has been charged with first-degree sexual assault of a child under the age of 12 and faces up to 60 years in prison if convicted.

Article text: Former Manchester United player Ray Wilkins believes Radamel Falcao has not done enough to earn a permanent deal at the club - and says he looks a shadow of his former self. 'He hasn't shown any type of form that we expected when he arrived at Manchester United.' Falcao chases down a ball at Old Trafford, but he has recently found himself benched by Louis van Gaal . Sunderland defender Patrick van Aanholt gets to grips with Falcao, who has struggled for form in England . The 29-year-old cost Monaco over £40m when signed a year-and-half ago from Atletico Madrid, where he forged a reputation as a goalscorer and netted a hat-trick against Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup in 2012. But Wilkins says he is nowhere near the standards that he showed at that game in Monaco. 'His form has been very poor in fact, we haven't seen anything like the player who absolutely destroyed Chelsea with Atletico Madrid a few years back,' he said. 'They have already paid a huge loan fee and his wages are extremely expensive. To take him on would require a big fee, I would think they will look elsewhere.' Falcao was at St James' Park for United's trip to face Newcastle United but didn't make it off the bench .

Ground truth Summary: Radamel Falcao has just four goals in 20 games for Manchester United .

Article text: A woman conned her husband into thinking that he was the father of her son after undergoing IVF treatment using her ex-boyfriend's sperm, a court heard. He said the man did not know at the time that his wife, who is in her 50s, had used her ex-boyfriend's sperm, although it was 'now quite clear what had happened'. Mr Brudenell said the little boy was born in late 2005 and when he was around six months old the couple separated. Divorce proceedings began and their divorce was finalised in 2008. He addded the man looked after the child when the woman was working and paid more than £80,000 in maintenance over the following few years . The mother, whose child is now nine years old, told Central London County Court that there is 'no merit' in her ex-husband's claim. Above, the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the court is located . In 2011 a dispute arose over the amount of contact he was having with the child - and the woman then told him that he was not the 'biological father'. Shortly afterwards that was confirmed when he took a DNA test. A lawyer told the judge today that the case was thought to be the first of its kind. The judge was told that the man was in his 60s, the woman was in her 50s, and the little boy was nine. She heard that the man and woman lived in different parts of the London area. The hearing continues and is expected to end tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Article text: Avoided jail: Tomas Drungelas, 33, was spared a prison sentence despite his 202 burglaries . The Lithuanian criminal broke into and burgled 202 homes in the Hertfordshire area between 2013 and 2014 to fund his addiction to alcohol and gambling, St Albans Crown Court was told. But Judge Andrew Bright QC said that he would spare Drungelas jail and send him on a locally-run rehabilitation course called Choices and Consequences, or the ‘C2 Programme’. He also said Drungelas would be tagged for 36 months, under curfew between 9pm and 6am and must complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Drungelas was also ordered to go on the victim empathy course as well as attend alcohol and gambling ‘intervention programmes’. The judge said: ‘The victims of some of the burglaries you have committed have contacted me and expressed their anger if you were to be treated leniently. ‘Under normal circumstances you would face five or six years in prison for the offences you have committed, and many people will say that this is not the way to deal with a prolific burglar. 'However, you have been given an opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to turning your life around.' He added: ‘Some may say that this is a let off, but it is not, because if you break any of the conditions or reoffend you will find yourself back in this court and you will serve the full sentence for the crimes you have admitted to, which could be five or six years in prison.’ The C2 Programme is run by Hertfordshire Constabulary in partnership with the probation service, ‘under the direction’ of Judge Bright. It aims to turn around the lives of ‘prolific offenders’ to offer them a ‘realistic opportunity to break free from the cycle of crime’. In its first year 31 criminals took part, confessing to 1,800 crimes. Sentencing: St Albans Crown Court (above) was told the Lithuanian criminal broke into and burgled 202 homes in the Hertfordshire area between 2013 and 2014 to fund his addiction to alcohol and gambling .

Article text: Youngsters who get themselves Saturday jobs like Brooklyn Beckham or Jamie Oliver's kids may end up harming their grades, a report has found. Results showed an extra hour of work per week in Year 10 saw their results drop around one grade in one subject the following year. The study analysed the hours these young people spent working and the impact of this on time spent on study time, other activities and their grades at GCSE level. Dr Angus Holford, who wrote the report called Youth Employment and Academic Performance, says approximately a quarter of 13 to 16-year-olds take on some form of formal paid employment during term time. ‘This can be a good thing – they earn their own money and can pick up useful skills, which might help them find full-time work in the future,’ he said, according to The Observer. ‘However, they may spend that hard-earned money on less than useful things, or fall in with a different group of people. ‘We did find that schoolchildren who worked became more likely to drink alcohol regularly, smoke or consume cannabis.’ He added the long-term effect of employment would be particularly damaging for ‘borderline students’ – those who are at risk of not achieving the targets needed (five A*-C grades, including English and mathematics) to progression into further education. Dr Holford added that as academic results at 16 have such a great influence over future careers, the results of his study should come as a warning to parents who want children to achieve their full potential.

Article text: Fans of Chelsea, Blackburn and Wigan may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker Franco di Santo is currently one of the hottest properties in Germany's Bundesliga with Werder Bremen where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches. The big striker took on Chelsea and their midfield giant Nemanja Matic in pre-season. Bremen won 3-1 . 'Just because some of the other teams in Germany aren't big names, it doesn't mean they're not good. 'We played Chelsea in pre-season and beat them 3-1. OK, it was pre-season but Chelsea put out a good team and it wasn't like they were able to score 10 against us.' Di Santo, a 6ft 4in centre forward, has packed a lot of experience into his short career. He left Argentina for Chile very young and at 17 signed for Chelsea with a big reputation. It didn't quite happen for him at Stamford Bridge and he failed to score a goal for them in two seasons. 'I had to be realistic, I was competing against (Didier) Drogba, (Nicolas) Anelka, (Andriy) Shevchenko, (Claudio) Pizarro and (Salomon) Kalou for a place and they were probably better than me at the time,' he admits. 'The most time I got was 45 minutes against Aston Villa when Anelka got injured.' The presence of Didier Drogba (left), who is still Di Santo's friend, made it difficult for him to get game time . Di Santo (right) says his loan to Blackburn went well at first but then he was dropped by Sam Allardyce . Franco di Santo has hailed his Argentine international team-mate Angel di Maria as one of the top 10 players in the world. Di Maria has struggled in England, as Di Santo did, following a record £59.7million summer move to Manchester United. But di Santo insists: 'Di Maria did so well in the World Cup for Argentina, it was a shame he was injured for the final against Germany otherwise the outcome might have been different, for sure. 'He is among the top 10 players in the world. His best position is on the wing, either right or left. He is quick and skilful but some players need more time to settle into a new league than others. 'I'd say (Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo are on a different planet but after them, there are five or six of around the level – Sergio Aguero, Arjen Robben, Edinson Cavani, Zlatan Ibrahimovic – and di Maria.' He went on loan to Blackburn. 'I played every single game for a half a season and did really well, but didn't score - that was my big problem. I decided to stay another six months but then the manager Sam Allardyce didn't play me any more. It was weird, from amazing to becoming very hard. But I did get a goal and assist in our local derby against Burnley and they made a DVD of the match with my face on the cover!' Ironically, it was Roberto Martinez – now in charge of England's sole Europa League survivors Everton – who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for Wigan on a permanent basis in 2010. 'It was my personal decision to leave Chelsea, I still had time on my contract but needed to play. Roberto told me I was good enough to play for Argentina, he gave me confidence. And he made me think about getting into the penalty area more. Before then, I only wanted to score pretty goals, go past a lot of players. 'Now I realise if it comes off my knee, it still counts as one goal and that has helped me.' Wigan won the FA Cup – Di Santo was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season, and Martinez left for Everton. He signed Arouna Kone, Antolin Alcaraz, James McCarthy and Joel Robles – but not Di Santo. 'There is no problem with that, it would have been difficult to sign so many players from Wigan,' says the player. Blackburn fans mob Di Santo after he scored against Burnley and it even earned him a space on a DVD cover . Wigan lifted the FA Cup at Wembley before being relegated, although Di Santo didn't play a single minute . Instead, the forward – who won three caps for Argentina during his time at the DW Stadium – went to Bremen in northern Germany and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens. His winning goal against Freiburg last weekend lifted Bremen up to eighth, just six points of a Champions League berth. Unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for Saturday's big match against Bayern. He still keeps in touch with old Chelsea pals like Drogba and Branislav Ivanovic and friends from Wigan like Alcaraz and Maynor Figueroa. He admits though that having not been ready for English football at 17, he would fancy a return at some point to see how the intensity and hard work in the German League have helped him develop. Wigan owner Dave Whelan gets a champagne shower from Di Santo, but they would soon part company . While Di Santo is enjoying the Bundesliga, he says he fancies a shot at 'revenge' in the Premier League . 'I am happy here really, I know I am in a league that is very competitive, one of the best in the world,' he said. 'In one way I am very happy here, I am doing well and playing in a very competitive league. But for the other side I would like to have my revenge in the English League, show what I can do with the experience I now have. It may depend on Roberto Martinez or other coaches what happens! 'If I have to stay in Germany, I am going to be happy, and for the other side, if I have to go to England, I will try to do my best to show I am better than last time.' Di Santo still has friends in England from his time there and keeps contact with a few Chelsea players . Di Santo faced top players in England but says Germany's lack of big names doesn't make teams 's***'

'A look at the table before the game was enough to see the urgency of the situation,' Germany coach Joachim Loew told reporters. 'We played a dynamic game, we then controlled it in the second half but did not have the same drive towards goal.' Loew said their conversion rate would need to improve after again spurning several good chances and hitting the woodwork twice. 'We again missed some good chances. We had good combinations but failed to score a third or fourth goal.' Georgia have had a tough start in Group D, recording four defeats and a win in Gibraltar to stay on three points. It did not take long for Germany, with several World Cup winners back in the squad including captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, to threaten with Reus' powerful drive palmed on to the crossbar by keeper Giorgi Loria after five minutes. With coach Loew reverting to a four-man defence from a three-player experiment against Australia in a friendly on Wednesday, the Germans were in and around their opponents' box for most of the first half. Thomas Muller slots home the second for Germany as they comfortably dispatched of Georgia . Mueller fired at goal from a corner only to see the ball fly just wide and Mesut Ozil missed another big chance as the visitors had the hosts firmly on the backfoot. Reus did better in the 39th when Mario Goetze charged into the box and was lucky to scramble the ball to the winger, who drilled home for his second goal this week, after also scoring in their 2-2 draw against Australia. Mueller then fired in another on the stroke of halftime to firmly put them in the driving seat. New Georgia coach Kakhaber Tskhadadze added a forward after the break but it was Reus who came close again, rattling the bar for a second time on the hour with another powerful shot. 'We are not yet fully on track and still have to improve,' said Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. 'But there is sufficient time and I am very confident.' Mario Gotze (right) fires just wide of the Georgia goal as Germany dominated the game throughout .

Article text: Inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt has marked a new milestone in her recovery after another harrowing health scare where her family feared the worst. Scroll down for video . New nose: Turia Pitt, pictured with mother Celestine and her new nose, was competing in an ultra-marathon through WA's Kimberley region in 2011 when she was caught in a bushfire . Before: Ms Pitt spent more than two years in hospital, much of it wearing a compression stocking (left) after experiencing burns to around 65 per cent of the body. Her face is pictured right prior to the reconstructive surgery on her nose performed recently . Burns victim: Ms Pitt experienced burns to around 70 per cent of her body during the 2011 bushfire. After years of recovery, Ms Pitt told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long!" Prior to the bushfire, Ms Pitt, from Ulladulla, on the NSW south coast, worked as a mining engineer and a model . Her mother, Celestine Vaite, said she and Turia's partner Michael Hoskin heard the hospital's cardiac arrest alarm go off 'and we thought she was gone'. 'I said, God, don't you dare. She's fought so hard, this girl,' she told the magazine. 'She fought to get out of bed, she fought to walk, she fought to accept - don't you dare do that to her!' It has been a long road to recovery for Ms Pitt, who suffered burns to around 65 per cent of her body when she was caught in a bushfire in the Kimberley in September 2011. Ms Pitt wore a compression stocking for almost two years and had seven of her fingers amputated during a seemingly endless series of operations. But she was not expecting complications in this latest procedure. Ms Pitt told the magazine: 'I thought I'd wake up in the burns unit, but instead I woke up in ICU.' Her family were relieved when she woke - and Ms Pitt is now happily showing off her reconstructed nose on social media. Milestone woman: Ms Pitt published a book about her experiences, aptly titled Everything to Live For . Soul mates: Turia Pitt's boyfriend, Michael Hoskin, has been by her side since the very beginning of her hospital experience .

Ultra-marathon runner: Ms Pitt is planning to participate in the Melbourne Ironman in 2016, after a further operation to her nose . She told Woman's Day: 'I can't believe I didn't have a nose for so long'. It's just the latest in a series of milestones for Ms Pitt, who last year published a book about her experiences, aptly titled Everything to Live For. She starred on the front cover of magazine The Australian Women's Weekly in June 2014. The cover won praise for featuring Ms Pitt. Ms Pitt has headlined a number of a speaking opportunities and in June 2014 she trekked the Great Wall of China to raise more than $175,000AUD for the charityInterplast. Interplast sends teams of volunteer medical workers to developing countries in Asia to provide free surgery for people suffering conditions including cleft lip and palate and burn scar contractures. Ms Pitt told Woman's Day she is planning to participate in the Melbourne Ironman next year, following an operation to 'refine her nose and widen her nostrils'. Ms Pitt and Mr Hoskin currently live in Ulladulla, on the south coast of New South Wales. Raising money for charity: Turia Pitt (left) last year raised $175,000AUD for the not-for-profit Interplast, which sends teams of medical professionals to assist people with severe burns and cleft lips and palates .
