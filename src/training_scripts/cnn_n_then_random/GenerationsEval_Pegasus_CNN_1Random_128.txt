Article text: Secretary of State John Kerry spent five minutes of a Senate hearing excoriating a group of 47 Republicans who sent a highly unusual letter to the government of Iran warning that Congress could modify the terms of any nuclear deal it negotiates with the White House. 'ISIS is a threat to them,' he said of Iran. 'It is a threat to the region. I think you are misreading it if you think there is not a mutual interest.' Kerry claimed the U.S. has 'the capacity' to 'knock out ISIL' on its own, but 'we're not going to get suckered into that.' 'The enduring transformation that has to take place here is not going to take place if the United States just comes in and were to knock out ISIL and that’s it – go away,' he said, adding that it's 'not gonna happen.' But Cotton's letter, also signed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several Republican presidential hopefuls, was Exhibit A on Wednesday. Formal treaties require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate, but 'the vast majority of international arrangements and agreements do not,' Kerry said. 'And around the world today we have all kinds of executive agreements that we deal with,' including 'any number of noncontroversial, broadly supported foreign policy goals.' START OF IT ALL: Arkansas freshman Senator Tom Cotton wrote a letter to Iran's leaders and persuaded 46 other Republicans in the Senate to sign it with him . The Obama administration and Senate Democrats have harshly condemned Cotton's letter, which was presented to leaders of the Islamic republic as a primer on the U.S. Constitution. It warned that 'the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.' As Kerry's turn on the hot seat began, protesters from the liberal anti-war group Code Pink interrupted – as they have done in other recent hearings. Like Arizona Sen. John McCain, who last month called them 'low-life scum' as they were led out of a hearing room, Kerry fired back at a woman who shouted repeatedly that 'the United States is killing innocent civilians with drones!' 'Killing more innocent people?' he asked aloud. 'I wonder how our journalists, who were beheaded, and a pilot who was fighting for freedom – burned alive – what they would have to say to their efforts to protect innocent people.' ENEMY OF MY ENEMY: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio heard Kerry say that Iran is helpful in fighting the ISIS terror army . The secretary of state will meet Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, next week in Switzerland for another round of talks. He said Cotton's letter 'erroneously asserts that this is a legally binding plan. It's not, that's number one.' 'Number two, it's incorrect when it says that Congress could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time. That's flat wrong,' he continued. 'They don't have the right to modify an agreement reached executive to executive between leaders.' Neither the U.S. nor Iran has emphasized the need for a legally binding deal because each has stronger forms of leverage. If Iran cheats, the Obama administration has spoken of re-imposing suspended sanctions. The U.S. has also held out the prospect of military action if Iran makes progress toward a nuclear weapon. Similarly, if the U.S. doesn't live up to its side of the bargain, the Iranians can ramp up enrichment levels of uranium, taking them closer to nuclear weapons capacity. Congress, too, wields a threat: new forms of economic punishment of Iran that would be forbidden in the agreement. But such a move would almost surely require overriding a presidential veto and could pin any diplomatic collapse on the United States. Negotiators from the U.S., Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia hope to seal a framework with Iran by month's end and a comprehensive agreement by July. Kerry scoffed at the notion that Obama's successor would discard a deal reached between so many powerful governments and adhered to by Iran. 'I'd like to see the next president, if all of those countries have said this is good and it's working, turn around and just nullify it on behalf of the United States,' he said. 'That's not going to happen.' READY TO MAKE HISTORY: Kerry shook hands with new Defense Secretary Ash Carter (left) as protesters anticipated the start of Wednesday's hearing . Questions about the process involved in any agreement with Shiite-majority Iran are sensitive for a variety of reasons. Israel, Sunni Arab countries and many U.S. lawmakers are concerned that international negotiators could be placing too much trust in Iran. The prospects of a 'nonbinding' pact will hardly alleviate their concerns, even if none of them have professed faith in Iran abiding by the terms of an agreement that would ease sanctions in exchange for at least a decade of strict limits on the Iranian nuclear program. Iran says its program is solely for peaceful energy and medical research purposes. On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, Kerry's spokeswoman, raised the possibility of the deal assuming legal character through the U.N. Security Council. Psaki didn't speak definitively on the matter but cited the example of a 2013 strategy agreed to between the U.S. and Russia on Syria relinquishing its chemical weapons stockpile. That plan was then endorsed by the United Nations' top body. 'This framework was not legally binding and was not subject to congressional approval,' Psaki told reporters during a daily press briefing. 'It outlined steps for eliminating Syria's chemical weapons and helped lay the groundwork for successful multilateral efforts to move forward.' In that case, she added, the U.S.-Russian agreement 'went to the U.N. to the Security Council vote.' Zarif is the only one who has gone on record saying such a model would be followed with a nuclear deal. U.S. negotiators have been more circumspect. Making such a declaration would amount to telling Congress that it won't have a say on the accord, because it is not a treaty, but that the United Nations will.

Article text: Target: Charles Dickens was the victim of an attempted attack on his carriage  in 1862 . But in June 1862, his regular route almost got him in trouble - as reported by local paper the South Eastern Gazette, which wrote about a 'diabolical attempt to overturn Mr C. Dickens' carriage' by farm worker James Stedman. Dickens was supposed to arrive at Higham at 10.30pm to be met by his groom, James Marsh, but he missed the train and the groom returned to Gad's Hill. The newspaper reported: 'A little distance on he found two rollers lying across the road, which, had they not been perceived in time, would have caused serious mischief. 'James Munn, a fellow workman of the prisoner, had accompanied Stedman from Strood to Higham by the 9.30, and when passing through the village saw Mr Dickens' carriage drive down to the station. 'The prisoner immediately afterwards went into a field and drew the two rollers across the road to upset the carriage on its return. Munn at the time held the gate open for the prisoner.' Transport: Dickens pictured in a horse-drawn carriage with his wife and daughters . Home: Dickens moved in to Gad's Hill Place, near Rochester in Kent, in 1856 . After the incident, Stedman sought refuge in a pub across the road from Dickens' home, where he played skittle - but was soon caught by the police. He was charged at Rochester Magistrates' Court with 'placing a horse-roller, and also a hand roller, on the middle of the turnpike road, at a late hour on Saturday night, with the intention of upsetting the carriage of Mr C. Dickens, which was returning from the Higham railway station'. Stedman pleaded drunkenness as his excuse, but a month later it emerged that he had done the same thing on a different road in a bid to overturn someone else's carriage, and he was sentenced to two months' hard labour. In 1859, George Blackman was jailed for three days after he stole hay from Dickens' home, which was one of the grandest in the area. Rubbish dumping was also a concern for Dickens, as in 1858 he was forced to write to a local pub landlord who continuously left his property a mess. Family: Dickens reads to his daughters in the grounds of the home, which he bought at the height of his fame . Dickens wrote: 'Mr Charles Dickens begs Mr Strood to be so good as to give directions that no rubbish or refuse from the Falstaff to be thrown into the shrubbery of Gad's Hill Place. 'Mr Dickens also hopes that Mr Strood will advise his customers not to trespass on that ground, in going from the Falstaff to the village. 'He wishes very earnestly to live on good terms with his neighbours of all degrees and he hopes that they know it, and will not fee disinclined to respect his property. 'He is sure that Mr Strood can have no desire not to do what is obliging and right, he therefore addresses this note to Mr Strood in good will and good humour.' Station: The railway station at Higham, near Gad's Hill, where Dickens would get the train from London . Trouble: Dickens wrote a letter to the landlord of the Falstaff pub complaining about litter . It was reported on another occasion that Dickens was forced to add a padlock to his cellar after locals broke in and stole champagne for a party. The author died at Gad's Hill in 1870, at the age of 58. The home is now a private school. Andrew Rootes, editor of Bygone Kent, said: 'I was brought up in the village of Higham, near where Dickens lived, and have always been an admirer, so was delighted to alight upon this incident tucked away in the British Newspaper Archive. 'Stedman was a fairly hopeless type of criminal, nowhere as impressive as the list of malefactors in Dickens's novels, but worthy of a minor role.'

Article text: Teenager Ash Handley scored on his home debut as Leeds moved to within two points of Super League leaders St Helens with a hard-fought 26-14 win over Wigan in front of a bumper 18,350 crowd at Headingley. Smith kicked the conversion and added a penalty six minutes later after Cuthbertson was pulled up for a high tackle on George Williams to make it 8-0 . However, the Warriors made a hash of the restart and never touched the ball for the next eight minutes as Leeds struck a purple patch with three tries. Substitute Brad Singleton went over for the third try for Leeds Rhinos . Cuthbertson, who qualifies for England, got the first, following up a grubber kick on the last tackle by hooker Paul Aiton and was also involved in a sweeping move that was finished at the corner by Handley. The former Newcastle Knights forward then produced a superb short pass to get substitute Brad Singleton over and Sutcliffe kicked his second goal to make it 18-6. Wigan finally managed to stem the tide and struck back four minutes before the break when left winger Joe Burgess caught Williams' kick on the full to dive over for a spectacular try, which was goaled by Smith to cut the gap to just two points. Defences got on top in the second half, with Wigan having to do most of the work as the Rhinos gained the momentum. Referee Richard Silverwood gave the visitors a team warning after they conceded a string of penalties and the pressure told on the hour when Sutcliffe stretched out of a two-man tackle to score his side's third try. Sutcliffe was off target with the conversion attempt but succeeded with a penalty five minutes later after he was tackled by Wigan's Liam Farrell from an offside position. Farrell was sin-binned for the offence and the Rhinos made the most of their man advantage when substitute Rob Burrow forced his way over from dummy half with 11 minutes to go.

Article text: England Test captain Alastair Cook could only make three runs as he opened the batting for MCC in their match against LV= County Championship winners Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi. Sidebottom removed Nick Compton - someone who has partnered Cook in Tests - with the first ball of the match as the MCC captain edged a delivery into Jonny Bairstow's gloves. Cook soon followed Compton back into the pavilion before Michael Carberry and James Hildreth steadied the ship. James Hildreth scored 89 to help MCC up to a score of 221 in their first innings in Abu Dhabi . Adam Lyth was unbeaten on 53 as Yorkshire closed day one on 82 for two in response . The duo put on 74 for the third wicket before Carberry fell for 36, but Hildreth pushed on and made 89 before Tim Bresnan got him out lbw after lunch. Daryl Mitchell (54) and Zafar Ansari (24) were the only others who could make it into double figures as the final five batsmen could only add five runs between them. Lyth then took centre-stage as he started the Yorkshire reply, although he lost fellow opener and captain Alex Lees as he was caught behind off the bowling of Matt Dunn for 11. The Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi is once again playing host to the floodlight contest . A 72-ball half-century from Lyth kept the reigning champions ticking over until Jack Leaning was caught off Ansari late in the day - with Steven Patterson brought in as night-watchman to see out the closing overs. He will return to the crease with Lyth (53 not out) on Monday with Yorkshire trailing by 139 runs with eight first-innings wickets in hand.

Aircraft carriers, because of their ability . to project force, are considered offensive weapons. General Nakatani, Japan's Minister of Defence, told media at the handover ceremony in Yokohama: 'The vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including . peace keeping operations, international disaster relief and . aid. It also helps improve our ability to combat submarines.' Japan is also adding longer-range patrol aircraft and . military cargo planes to its defence capability, and buying . Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, amphibious assault . vehicles and Boeing's Osprey troop carrier, which can . operate from the Izumo. President Abe's attempts to ease Japan's pacifist constitution and its build up in defence capabilities is unnerving neighbour China. The Izumo does not have a catapult necessary to launch . fixed-wing fighters, but a planned vertical-take-off-and-landing . (VTOL) variant of the F-35 could fly from the Izumo's flight . deck. Based at Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, also the home port . of the U.S. Seventh Fleets carrier battle group, the Izumo will . join two smaller helicopters carriers already in service that . are also classed as destroyers. Soldiers march and salute on the deck of the massive warship, which is capable of holding a maximum of 28 aircraft . However, Japan classes it as a helicopter destroyer, a label that allows it to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war . General Nakatani, Japan's Defense Minister, speaks to naval soldiers during the commissioning ceremony of the Izumo warship . Soldiers untangle a rope on board the aircraft carrier, which measures 250m in length . Japan's constitution, known as the Peace Constitution, is most famous for the renunciation of the right to wage war. It was drawn up under the Allied occupation which followed the Second World War and was intended to replace Japan's previous militaristic and absolute monarchy system with liberal democracy. Japan was responsible for drawing the U.S. into the war after it launched a surprise attack on the U.S naval base Pearl Harbor in 1941. The attack was intended as a preventive action to keep the U.S. from interfering with its planned military actions in Southeast Asia, which included overseas territories of the UK, Netherlands, and the United States. The conflict escalated massively when the U.S dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. This led to the surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945 and brought the hostilities of World War II to a close. Japan's constitution was enacted on May 3, 1947. Hiroshima was left devastated (pictured) after the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the city, ending the war and leading to the 'Peace Constitution'

Shortly after sunrise on Tuesday, federal agents swarmed an upscale apartment complex in the Orange County city of Irvine where authorities say a birth tourism business charged pregnant women $50,000 for lodging, food and transportation. According to the LA Times, during the raid pregnant women were seen opening doors to apartments, looking confused and then slamming them shut. One agent announced 'baby here' and then called over a colleague to go inside. Crying babies could be heard from several apartments, according to the LA Times. Investigators said women were coached to lie about their travel plans when applying for tourist visas and were promised they would receive Social Security numbers and U.S. passports for their babies before returning to China. In one instance, a trainer in China helped fabricate employment and income information for an undercover federal agent posing as a pregnant client to secure a tourist visa and encouraged her to fly through Hawaii, where customs officers were believed to be more lenient than in Los Angeles, according to a copy of an affidavit in support of a search warrant. The business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped Chinese tourists deliver more than 400 American babies at Orange County hospitals, the court papers said. No arrests were made or charges filed. Investigators conducted the searches in Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, hoping to collect evidence of crimes tied to three separate maternity tourism operations, including visa and tax fraud, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. ICE agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security look into the window of a luxury apartment in Rowland Heights, Orange County . Federal agents enter an upscale apartment complex on Tuesday in Irvine, California. Shortly after sunrise, federal agents swarmed the complex in Orange County where authorities say a birth tourism business charged pregnant women $50,000 for lodging, food and transportation . A website that advertises the services of a U.S. company catering to women from China who want to give birth in the U.S. Federal agents undertook a massive raid at a complex in Irvine, California on Tuesday . The key draw for travelers is that the United States offers birthright citizenship. Maternity tourists believe citizenship will help their children secure a top-notch U.S. college education and provide a sort of insurance policy should economic conditions crumble in their home country — especially since the tourists themselves can apply for a green card once their American child turns 21. Bill Ong Hing, professor of the University of San Francisco School of Law, said wealthy foreigners from across the world often travel to the United States for medical care and are allowed to do so on visitor visas, provided they don't overstay. U.S. Customs and Border Protection warns on its website that officers at airports and on the border will consider a pregnant woman's due date, travel plans and medical insurance to determine whether she can enter the country. In the Irvine case, investigators said another undercover officer posing as a pregnant traveler was told not to apply for her visa too late as she would be denied if she were noticeably pregnant. A pregnant woman who was questioned at the airport said she was told to say she was simply a tourist, court papers said. Investigators also tracked the movements of a couple who arrived in February 2014, had their baby in April and returned in May. While the couple's bank account recorded charges at luxury stores including Louis Vuitton and Rolex, they paid $4,080 — less than 15 per cent of the billed amount — to the hospital for medical services after stating the mother was not employed, the affidavit said. Federal agents started investigating the business after an anonymous tip last year. In 2013, Los Angeles County cited more than a dozen maternity hotels for code violations after an uproar in a nearby suburban community about a hotel operating in a residential neighborhood. Jon Feere, legal policy analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, said he believes birth tourism will grow along with international travel. 'There is a sense the foreigner has control over our immigration policy rather than the American people,' said Feere, who wants stricter limits on immigration. The business netted its owners hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years and helped Chinese tourists deliver more than 400 American babies at Orange County hospitals, according to court papers .

Article text: Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. It's latest iteration is more human-like than ever. A video posted by New Scientist shows it playing a game of paddle war – a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball, while stopping their rival from scoring. A video shows iCub playing a game of paddle war (pictured) – a  game where two players each hold a paddle and try to score goals using a digital ball, while stopping their rival from scoring - but the robot is a sore loser! The robot’s goals and emotions change constantly, based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing. When iCub concedes a goal, it frowns and furrows its light-up eyebrows, sometimes swearing like an ill-tempered human. When it scores a goal, it smiles and says phrases like ‘got it,’ although there is not much change in intonation whether a phrase is negative or positive. The robot’s goals and emotions change constantly, based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately. A stock image is shown . The robot laughs, or says ‘ha ha’ when the ball ricochets off the side of the screen, but is seemingly a bad loser. ‘That isn’t fair, I should be stronger at video games!’ it says, after losing the game. The video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched, a little bit like a slightly creepy human. When a human strokes its arms it affects iCub’s reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video: ‘I like when you touch me this way'. ‘Enjoying’ the human contact, the machine smiles and says: 'please, caress me again'. Tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning, such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position, as instructed. Scientists are so keen to develop human-like robots to advance the field of artificial intelligence, which they hope could one day be used in medicine, and even eradicate disease and poverty, for example. A group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity, and doesn't destroy it. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document , drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. A group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking (pictured), have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity, and doesn't destroy it . 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming. 'Our AI systems must do what we want them to do,' the letter says. 'Many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of AI while mitigating adverse effects, which could include increased inequality and unemployment.' The letter followed comments made by Professor Hawking, who warned that AI could someday overtake humans. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC : 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' Musk has previously described AI as our 'biggest existential threat'.

Article text: (CNN)"The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man." I still remember the first time I read the passage from "The Jungle Book," heart racing beneath my pajamas covered with The Six Million Dollar Man. Then everybody in the jungle suffers," Rudyard Kipling wrote. I probably understood that tiger attacks were fairly rare in Milwaukee, but to my 11-year-old brain, Kipling was dropping wisdom that just might keep me alive on the next expedition into the weedy lot behind Piggly Wiggly. "The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him." Reading that passage 35 years later, while rolling through the very forest that inspired the classic, the irony in that line finally clicks. When we hear the woof of a frightened deer and my guide kills the engine, my grown-up heart pounds once again. It is a sign that there may be big cats nearby. "I wonder who will be the last person to see a tiger in the wild? And are they alive today?" These are the questions that launched this stop on "The Wonder List," and they led us to a much bigger question about life in the 21st century: Is the planet still big enough for man and man-eater? India is about one-third the size of the continental United States, with four times as many people. That kind of human pressure has changed Kipling's "Law of the Jungle" in dramatic ways. According to the animal conservation group Born Free, there are more tigers in cages in Texas than in the forests of India. So I set out to understand how and why. Having covered the poaching of African animals to feed the huge market for Asian medicine, I assumed the demand for tiger-skin rugs in Dubai or tiger-bone wine in Beijing would be the biggest threat to this endangered cat. Can tigers claw their way back from the brink? But it turns out that tiger-human conflict is a much bigger problem. Almost half a billion rural Indians have no plumbing and answer nature's call by squatting in the forest. Most tiger attacks happen when these people are mistaken for prey, and most tiger kills come in the angry hours that follow, as friends and neighbors of the victim seek revenge. And so, a new specialty in conservation is the art of tiger conflict mediation. It is not easy to convince a frightened farmer that the cat that ate his cow is more valuable alive than caged or dead. But these efforts, along with a more pointed anti-poaching campaign, seem to be paying off. The latest tiger census counted 2,226 big cats in India, a 30% increase over the previous count in 2011. If the estimates hold, this would make India the only country in the world with a growing tiger population. But the human population is growing much faster. Maintaining a healthy population of apex predators is just one new challenge on a planet that will welcome a couple billion more people in just the next generation. You'll be surprised by the others as we seek India's magnificent treasures -- both natural and man-made -- on the next episode of "The Wonder List."

FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Russia in December 2010 as the host of the 2018 World Cup . The victory was only the fourth the 185th-ranked East Timor achieved since becoming FIFA members in 2005. Such was the excitement for the fixture in the Portuguese-speaking Southeast Asian nation, that a big screen was erected outside the Municipal Stadium for fans who couldn't get their hands on one of the 10,000 tickets on sale. They would have seen their diminutive striker, better known as Quito, strike in the seventh and 10th minutes before Brazilian-born Rodrigo Silva netted a third in the 89th minute and substitute Neto grabbed a fourth in stoppage time. Batmonkhiin Erkhembayar grabbed a late consolation for the visitors to give them some slight hope of overturning the deficit in the second leg in Mongolia on Tuesday. In other matches, India beat Nepal 2-0, while Yemen play Pakistan. The six aggregate winners will move into the second round of the Asian World Cup campaign, which doubles as the qualifiers for the 24-team 2019 Asian Cup, where the likes of regional powerhouses Japan, Australia and Iran enter the fold.

Article text: (CNN)Michael Graves, an American architect and designer, died Thursday at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, of natural causes, according to his firm. His line for Target included practical items from tea kettles and drying racks to whimsical kitchen equipment like an avocado scooper and large bamboo salad tongs. His Target line came with a simple, idealistic premise: "Good design should be affordable to all." His designs were also sold at JCPenney and Black & Decker. He was awarded the National Medal of the Arts, as well as the Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture. Born in Indianapolis, Graves received his training at the University of Cincinnati and Harvard. In 1962, he began teaching at Princeton University. In 2003, Graves became paralyzed from the chest down after suffering what started out as a sinus infection. Graves recalled being severely ill and examining the ugly sheets and bad design in hospitals. He decided: "It's far too ugly for me to die here." The illness phased in a new chapter in his life. Struggling in hospital rooms made him determined to improve health care facilities and designs, including more user-friendly hospital furniture for patients. "I wouldn't have been a health care nut if it hadn't been for my paralysis, so something good came from this," he told CNN in 2011. Michael Graves: Why hospital rooms don't work . Throughout his illness, Graves continued to sketch. "Whether I was paralyzed or not, I would draw, because drawing for me is like playing the piano," he told CNN. "You've got to keep practicing, got to keep doing it. It's not that you lose it, but you don't draw as well if you don't draw every day."

Article text: Burnley manager Sean Dyche has reassured Danny Ings that the door is still open to a senior England call-up if his rise to stardom continues. That’s the big thing when you’re a young player, and particularly playing at this level. Are you getting used to it? Are you learning? Overall he has. ‘There are no guarantees. It’s for Roy Hodgson and his staff to decide. As long as he keeps progressing, he’ll certainly always be in their thinking.’ Ings' contract at Turf Moor expires at the end of the season but Dyche wants him to push on for Burnley . The Clarets boss was not surprised to see Ings left out of the senior set-up considering the depth of forwards . Ings’s strike partner Sam Vokes has been recalled to the Wales squad for the first time in more than a year for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel, just a few days after making his first Premier League appearance for Burnley in last weekend’s surprise win over Manchester City. Vokes, 25, missed the first five months of the season with a knee injury and Dyche admits the player is still getting back to his best. He added: ‘I’m sure judging by how Sam operated last week that he’s well and truly on his way to full match fitness. I don’t expect it to happen overnight, it’s down to the game time we can give him when we think it’s appropriate. Hodgson opted for Harry Kane, Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck as his strikers . Ings and Kane (right) are  key members of the side for Southgate (left) ahead of the European Championships . ‘I spoke to Chris (Coleman) and let him know where he was at. I said it was touch and go whether he started (against City), and I did start him. ‘I still think there is more to come from him – that true match fitness that can only come from games – so we’ll try and be wise with that. ‘It’s important with a player’s recovery to be given time. That has paid itself back with a reasonable, if not a good performance actually, last week. There is still more to come as he gets used to this level and the sharpness returns.’ Sam Vokes has been named in Wales' squad for their upcoming games after over a year out of the set-up . Vokes has been rewarded for his good form with Burnley, including playing in the win over Manchester City .

Ground truth Summary: Roy Hodgson announced his latest England squad on Thursday afternoon .
Danny Ings was not selected as one of four strikers, including Harry Kane .
Burnley forward was instead picked in Gareth Southgate's Under 21s .
Sean Dyche says he believes that Ings is in England's thoughts .
He encourages the young striker to keep up form that brought attention .
