Article text: Passengers aboard a SkyWest flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, were stunned Tuesday when an hour from reaching their sunny vacation destination, their pilot turned the plane around due to 'paperwork issues.' Flight 4507 departed Salt Lake City International Airport just after noon Tuesday, carrying 57 travelers en route to the popular resort town on the Pacific Ocean. Scroll down for video . Clerical snafu: SkyWest Flight 4507 carrying 57 passengers to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Tuesday was forced to turn around and return to Utah due to a paperwork issue . Unpleasant surprise: The plane was about an hour from reaching its destination when a pilot announced the bad news . 'It's something that we wouldn't have known what to do as pilots as far as this airplane not being allowed to land in Mexico,' the crew member uttered over the PA system, according to a cellphone video obtained by KSL. The pilot explained to passengers that he could not land in Puerto Vallarta. Instead, he said the plane will be diverted to Tucson, Arizona, to be refueled before returning to Salt Lake City. 'Again, we do apologize,' the pilot said over the intercom to the 57 disappointed passengers. Casey Boyd, from Denver, was flying to Mexico on vacation with his wife and child when their plans were unexpectedly derailed by an unspecified clerical error. ‘No, it sounds pretty unbelievable,’ Boyd said. ‘It doesn't sound like maybe the whole story.’ A spokeswoman for SkyWest Airlines stated that Flight 4507 landed in Salt Lake City at around 6pm to correct a 'paperwork issue.’ Pit stop: Instead of landing at Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport in Puerto Vallarta, the SkyWest jet headed to Arizona to be refueled . Back to square one: At around 6pm, the plane landed in Salt Lake City, where passengers were offered hotel rooms and food vouchers for the night . The unfortunate travelers were offered free hotel rooms for the night, issued vouchers for food and other expenses, and rebooked on another flight departing Wednesday morning. ‘We apologize to those customers we've inconvenienced and are working to get them on their way as quickly as possible,’ the statement read. The airline representative did not specify the paperwork issue that kept the SkyWest plane from landing in Mexico Tuesday. Casey Boyd said that before takeoff Tuesday, the gate agent said the flight was overbooked because they were using a smaller plane that originally planned . It has been suggested that perhaps the replacement plane did not have the right documentation to touch down in Puerto Vallarta, but no one noticed the mistake until it was too late.

Article text: (CNN)Two more American aid workers who had high-risk exposure to Ebola in Sierra Leone arrived back in the United States on Monday for monitoring. "However, because of a change in symptoms, we decided the most prudent course of action was to bring the individual to the Biocontainment Unit, where we can better monitor symptoms and safely perform testing. However, some of the symptoms which prompted the move to the Biocontainment Unit have resolved this morning." None of the other aid workers are showing symptoms of Ebola. Nurse who contracted Ebola sues hospital company . State health authorities say all 10 of the workers are deemed to have had high-risk exposure to Ebola. This includes people who were not wearing protective gear and were exposed to the bodily fluids of someone with Ebola while that person was symptomatic, or someone who lived in the same household and provided direct care to a symptomatic Ebola patient. The first of these workers arrived Friday night in Atlanta showing possible signs of Ebola, but testing over the weekend came back negative, according to a government official who did not want to be named. The worker is being isolated in housing near Emory University Hospital for 21 days. "Twice a day, we'll have visual monitoring, either face to face or we'll Skype with them, or do FaceTime," said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health. "And if it's Skype or FaceTime, they'll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they're supposed to be." The next set of aid workers returned back to the United States on Saturday evening and went into isolation in housing on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, according to spokesman Taylor Wilson. As in Atlanta, these workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing. "They will be monitored so they'll stay there," Wilson said. Another set of three workers arrived Sunday morning at housing near the National Institutes of Health. These workers will have more freedom to move around than the ones in Georgia and Nebraska. According to Christopher Garrett, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health, his state will follow the CDC's guidelines, which forbid monitored individuals from getting on public transportation but allow them to go outside as long as they stay at least 3 feet away from other people. '1686: That's my number' Two more workers arrived Monday morning in Atlanta and were isolated in housing near Emory. A third worker was expected to arrive Monday in Atlanta, but health authorities deemed this person to be lower risk and allowed for monitoring at home, according to a government official.

Nina Pham, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, was admitted to NIH in October after she contracted the disease while treating Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan. Pham recovered and was released free of disease. Duncan died. Emory, the NIH and Nebraska are three of only four hospitals in the United States that have biocontainment units to deal with a highly infectious disease such as Ebola. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates back to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all of the deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. CNN's Carma Hassan, Joe Sutton and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.

He added: ‘Other people were rather worried that if Cyril Smith went before a court, he would open his mouth.’ Another ex-officer, Tony Robinson, said he had advised Lancashire Police to look at the case file he found locked in a Special Branch safe in the 1970s. ‘It doesn’t surprise me at all that they’ve dismissed the claims,’ he said. ‘It’s an easy way out.’ A Lancashire Police spokesman said it had referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission which ‘determined that a local investigation be carried out’. He added that the Constabulary’s Professional Standards Department found ‘absolutely no evidence to substantiate any of the claims’.

Article text: David Cameron has said that he will remain in Parliament as an MP even if he is forced to leave Downing Street after the election. 'I think this Government is doing some good things for our country and I want to keep on doing that. 'It's the country's choice, if they hoof me out and go for the other guy, I'll have to think of something else. But I hope I hope I'll still be a Member of Parliament.' He insisted that the Conservatives could win a majority and said that no one on his team was preparing contingencies for a hung parliament. During the online interview, Mr Cameron said he was proud of the 'genuinely ground-breaking' work the Government has done on internet safety and spoke about his own children. He said: 'Now when you set up your account the filters are automatically on. I' ve got three children of primary school age and they get to find out the code on your iPad pretty quickly. 'It is reassuring to know the Government has done some very good things on this. I think having the filters switched on is good.' Mr Cameron said that his children do not have unfettered access to mobile phones. He said: 'My daughter has got an iTouch but everything is quite strictly controlled in terms of screen time and we have the filters on for things like my iPad. 'But this is a conversation every parent in the country is having with their children. What age should they be when they should have a Facebook account and unfettered access to a mobile phone? 'We've got an 11-year-old, a nine-year-old and a four-year-old so we're not at that stage yet.' Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt for the interview with BuzzFeed in central London . Mr Cameron said that he personally has an iPhone 'which is basically for family and friends' and a BlackBerry that he uses for work emails. He said that he was not a user of the popular phone app SnapChat, but he said that he sometimes looked at the messages people send him on Twitter, adding: 'You have got to take the rough with the smooth in this job.' When asked if he ever sneaks out of Downing Street without his security detail, Mr Cameron said: 'No because they are trained killers.' Questioned on the four schoolgirls from east London who are thought to have fled to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State, Mr Cameron said: 'I think they're deeply misguided and potentially joining a criminal organisation that could make them part of a terrorist conspiracy. 'We want to get them back and try to get this radical nonsense out of their heads.' Mr Cameron disclosed that - like Ed Miliband - he has two kitchens in his London home. But the Prime Minister said he had the second kitchen installed in his house in Notting Hill for the benefit of the carers who looked after his disabled son Ivan, who died in 2009. Mr Miliband last week faced accusations that he was out of touch following the disclosure that he had two kitchens after he and his wife Justine were filmed in the smaller of the pair for a BBC interview. Mr Cameron said: 'We actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen, not least because I had a very disabled son, Ivan, and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them as well has for him. 'The point is not whether you have got two kitchens, but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it's your kitchen. That's the issue.' The interview was part of the American website's BuzzFeed Brews series that usually sees people answer questions over a beer. Mr Cameron dressed down for the event in front of trendy advertising and new media types by wearing an open-necked shirt, but he declined an alcoholic drink and instead sipped water during the interview in central London. He told the audience that he was a 'big fan' of popular television series Game of Thrones. BuzzFeed, which is well-known for its list-based articles, has become increasingly popular with young people on both sides of the Atlantic, but Mr Cameron faced embarrassment at a No 10 Christmas drinks party in December last year when he asked a group of the site's writers: 'What is 'the BuzzFeed'?'

Article text: Sierra Leone's top sprinter, who went missing after the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last summer, has been arrested after he was found living rough on the streets of London. He has been arrested for overstaying his visa and claims all his immediate family are dead from Ebola so he cannot return home . When Thoronka, the country's number one 100m sprinter, left Sierra Leone for Glasgow, some Ebola cases had been confirmed in a few of the villages surrounding Freetown, but the epidemic had not yet taken hold of the capital. The death toll in the country is now more than 3,500 cases. The runner said: 'I was hoping to win a medal for my country. But during the Games I got the terrible news that my uncle had died, probably from Ebola. 'I couldn't stop crying. It was difficult to continue with competing but I tried to carry on.' He is not working illegally, nor claiming benefits or housing, and understands the legal implications of remaining in the UK after his visa has expired, but said his situation is hopeless. After the Games, he stayed for a while with friends in Leicester - and found out that his entire immediate family had been killed by Ebola. Later he went to London and began sleeping in parks and on night buses and begging for £1 from passers-by to buy chips. Hampden Park in Glasgow was the venue for the track and field events during the Commonwealth Games . 'Some days I get no food at all. I wash in public toilets and sleep in the park,' he said. 'I wake up around 4am and if I've got a bus pass I get on the night bus and sleep there until morning. 'I met a man who sometimes lets me sleep at his house but I have to wait outside for him to come home at 10 or 11pm and I get very cold. 'We have a cold season in Sierra Leone but it is not cold like England. Some days I don't think I'm going to make it and just feel like killing myself. 'My dream is to become one of the best sprinters in the world but I don't see how that can happen now.' The newspaper said hundreds of people have been in touch to offer support, and a petition has been set up on change.org to support him. A GoFundMe page set up in his name only yesterday has received more than 700 donations totalling nearly £13,000. A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, but there is assistance available for people to return home when they are not entitled to remain in the UK.'

Article text: A woman thought the handwritten letter she threw over the fence to her noisy neighbours had worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep until she was woken before dawn on Sunday. She posted the letter on her blog with the precursor: 'So if you never hear from me again, I've been kidnapped and forcibly trapped in my neighbours' sound system.' Gransbury chose to replace the expletives she had the strong urge to use with the more polite neighbourly word of 'funk' in her letter that was also published on Mamamia website. 'Dear Noisy Neighbours, . 'There are some choice swear words I would like to throw at you, but in the interest of being neighbourly, I'm going to replace them all with the word 'funk'. 'Please turn your funking music down so I can get some funking sleep,' the letter opened with. Lucy Gransbury wrote a lengthy and quite hilarious handwritten letter to her noisy neighbours after enduring four months of sleepless nights due to their incessantly wild nocturnal ways . The actor/comedian used her humour in the two-page rant to get her rage across to the party-hard residents who live next door and cause her never-ending grief . Gransbury even took photographic evidence of the moment she cheekily threw the note over their adjoining fence before running off in hysterics . She then went onto say that she had been living for the past four months next to the culprits and was woken up by them 'all the funking time'. Adding that the night before she wrote the letter when was woken at 4.30am was an uncivilised time that should only be reserved for 'breakfast radio hosts, international flight passengers, and parents of infants.' Gransbury said she wanted to yell out to them at 5am but wouldn't have been heard over the revving of their friend's engine of their 'sh*thouse fancy ute.' 'They were then reversing down your driveway for so long and with such difficulty, that I am worried that the man behind the wheel was: A) drink driving B) not sure how to drive C) brain damaged D) actually a potato.' She signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left' Her hopes of the music stopping were quickly dashed as she continued to hear one note on the bass guitar 'over and funking over.' 'I'm not sure if it's you, or perhaps a friend, but one man seemed to contribute to the party by yelling 'derpa, derpa, derpa, derpa' at the top of his lungs. Is he okay?' she asked sarcastically. She expressed concern that this man is either not sure how to be human, brain damaged or simply a moron. The music was finally turned down at 6am - just two hours before Gransbury had to go out and begin her day. 'Everyone in my street probably feels the same. And the street behind us. And the deaf man in the next suburb. And anyone buried in the cemetery four kilometres away.' She also gave her neighbours two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with apt songs but then revealed that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs . Gransbury said she bought this card because 'Shut The F**k Up' was not available in a large size . As the considerate neighbour, Gransbury gave her next door pals two gifts - a pair of headphones and a CD she compiled herself with the apt songs: Respect by Aretha Franklin, 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, 'All About The Bass' by Meghan Trainor, 'Stop Right Now' by The Spice Girls and Uptown Funk' by Bruno Mars 'because it's just a funkin' good song, really'. But she later revealed in the note that the CD was actually blank because she was 'too funking tired' to burn the songs. After suggesting to catch up over a G&T sometime, she asked them to 'Grow up. Get some funking manners. And Go. The Funk. To Sleep.' Gransbury also warned them that she would call the police if there was a next time. The exhausted performer signed off with her Twitter handle or if you wanted to follow her in real life just 'head towards the loud house and turn left'.

Article text: The plans were agreed by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood (pictured) who was nicknamed Sir Cover-Up for preventing the Chilcot inquiry . Ministers point that out civil servants can blow the whistle on a major scandal using legal protections afforded to them in the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1988. But Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union that represents civil servants, said it was absurd to enforce a ‘blanket ban’ on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists. Mr Penman: ‘Civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media, and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public – as that’s who they are talking to through the media – about the service they deliver.’ The Cabinet Office insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media. They insist it simply ‘clarifies’ current practice. Mr Maude last night: ‘The Cabinet Secretary and I are both clear that no one should be exposed to personal and professional risk for doing what is in the public interest. ‘The amendments make no change to the rights of individuals under whistleblowing legislation or our drive to increase Government transparency and openness. 'However, we will consult on strengthening the protections for whistleblowers.’

Article text: The soothing tones of Bob Marley drifted through the air at Stamford Bridge as the teams prepared for extra-time. Tighter, faster, they could not allow the tempo to slip against PSG. Edinson Cavani rattled the woodwork. That was minute 58. Perhaps he should have scored. His team-mates threw themselves to the turf in despair. Minute 43 was a penalty Chelsea might have had. Minute 31 was the red card for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It was harsh and it might have killed off weaker teams. Not so Paris. They have bottle to go with their ability. Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is shown the red card after a collision with Chelsea's Oscar . The 33-year-old heads into this challenge with Oscar (left) in the first-half which got him sent off . The PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar . Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half at Stamford Bridg . Chelsea had work to do. They had to stop football breaking out, for one thing, because when it did, the French were better at it. As in Paris, Courtois came under fire as those in front of him started to wilt. It has been an intense campaign and, despite his fears about the relentless intensity of the English game and the way some training sessions are more competitive than the games in French football, Mourinho has been low on rotation. He has relied instead on the rotation enforced by various suspensions. On Thursday night he lost Matic, and the decision to send on Kurt Zouma backfired when they conceded almost immediately. Minute 81 they liked at the Bridge. Minute 86, not so much. When Gary Cahill scored, the first thing Mourinho did was to turn to the crowd and urged calm. Then he sent on Zouma. When Luiz equalised, again he called for calm. This time the message was aimed at his players. Take it into extra-time if necessary, with the extra man. That was the idea. No-one had Minute 114 on their Burnley bingo card. This time the chaos theory did not work. PSG defender  Luiz celebrated excitedly after scoring against his former club at Stamford Bridge . Thiago Silva's late header loops over the outstretched arm of Thibaut Courtois to knock Chelsea out .

Article text: A single tuna roams a once-flourishing tank at an aquarium in Japan after more than 150 of its fishy friends died unexpectedly. Researchers are trying to find out the cause of their deaths, and one option being explored is poisoning. Unexplained:The cause of the deaths of more than 150 fish is being explored, but is not currently known . Lone fish: Just one lonely tuna remains in the vast doughnut-shaped tank at Tokyo Sea Life Park in Japan . A spokesman for the tourist attraction said: 'We have had the tuna tank since the aquarium opened in 1989 but never experienced this kind of mass-dying. 'We are studying what caused the fish deaths, but we haven't figured it out yet. We suspect that it could be due to new factors that were not present before.' The tank's lighting and other factors that could have caused stress among the fish, or the presence of a poisonous substance in the water are being considered. The 2,200-tonne tank once housed 69 bluefin tuna, 52 eastern little tuna and 38 oriental bonito. In December, the tank's population suddenly started plunging with just 30 fish alive by mid-January. Researchers are trying to find out the cause of their deaths, and one option being explored is poisoning . 'The second last one that just died apparently crashed into the acrylic wall twice,' the spokesman added. 'It suffered a broken backbone, which was unfortunate but not very unusual for tuna kept in a tank. 'An earlier examination has found some sort of virus among some of the dead fish, but it wasn't the kind that is usually fatal in fish farms.'

Article text: A jilted husband has been jailed for almost a year and given a restraining order after rampaging through his former marital home with a chainsaw to reduce its value. Lounge: The father-of-two hacked at two log burners in the house in his trail of destruction last year, which has left him in prison . Revenge: Despite being to blame for the breakdown of their marriage Brooks decided to continue to abuse his wife by destroying their home when it was put in her name . After the house was put in his wife's name he went berserk and chopped it up with a chainsaw. The father-of-two had been desperate for revenge and wanted to knock thousands off the value of the rural property after the collapse of the couple's 14-year marriage. During his £9,000 rampage, Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, three internal doors and an internal beam, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace. At Preston Crown Court, Brooks, now of Eccles, Greater Manchester pleaded guilty to criminal damage and was jailed for 46 weeks. These pictures of the aftermath of the rampage were shown to Judge Jacqueline Beech, who sent him to prison. She told him: 'This was an act of revenge or retribution against your former wife who had the courage to leave the abusive relationship she was in with you'. During the course of that relationship you were physically and emotionally abusive to her and you made her life a misery. Entry: After his ex-wife changed the locks Brooks cut his way in to the cottage through this door by slashing a hole in its bottom panel . Deliberate act: The former soldier had slashed through the majority of the house's doors before the police arrived after neighbours saw him wandering around with a chainsaw . Abuse: Brooks also drove the chainsaw through several cupboards in the house as part of a revenge attack on his ex-wife Bridget . The judge said: 'You were aggrieved about the separation and the sale of the house and equity. You wanted to reduce the value and prospective of a sale by causing damage to it. She has suffered anxiety, panic attacks since the separation from you and has been prescribed medication and has anxiety because by the uncertainty of when you might turn up.' She said reports alleged Brooks had shown 'no remorse' and that he 'continued to blame his wife for the current circumstances'. She added: 'This was a pre-planned offence involving you taking a chainsaw to your former matrimonial home to wreak revenge upon your wife. It was part of the continuing course of conduct whilst there was a restraining order. 'The circumstances of this offence and value of damage caused, means an immediate prison sentence is inevitable. Your conduct was towards the mother of your children.' Earlier the court heard the couple split up in September 2011 and in May 2014 at the matrimonial court, an order was made transferring ownership of the property to Mrs Brooks' name. But Mrs Brooks was said to have had concerns that her former husband would take steps to reduce the value of the property, which was at the time vacant, in revenge for her being awarded the house. As a result the locks on the door were changed and the keys were deposited at the police station so that entry could only be gained by going to the station. The house insurance was also increased by Mrs Brooks. Days later Brooks was seen by a neighbour at the rear of his former address walking around the garden with the chainsaw. He was seen taking the chainsaw in order to remove the panel of the PVC door. He was to say that he had lost his keys and did not want to change the locks before using the chainsaw to gain access into the property. Attack: Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, pictured, three internal doors, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace . Flagrant: Brooks even took his chainsaw to the the beams of the pretty Lake District cottage after becoming bitter about the break-up . Indiscriminate: The former soldier took the chainsaw to the majority of external and internal doors, reminiscent of terrifying scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining where star Jack Nicholson hacks through them with an axe. Brooks had been previously handed a restraining order in September 2012 following two offences of harassment and then two further charges of harassment where he received a community order. The court was told that he had been residing in Manchester with his new partner and his eldest son who he was tutoring in the run up to his GCSEs. It is believed his younger son lives with his mother. In mitigation, Mr Alexander Langhorn asked for his sentence to be suspended and for him to be credited for his early plea. He said that upon leaving school at 16 Brooks had worked in a number of fields including mechanics before joining the Armed Forces serving with a distinction in a number of areas throughout the world. But upon the birth of his second son he left and had worked as a landscape gardener. He added that his client had been 'a positive role model'. Mr Langhorn said: 'He had been very much part of his children's lives and wanted to do the best for them. He knows he has put them at risk. He has been tutoring his son throughout the year, he knows that anything he does now, any sentence he faces, the impact is not only on him but also on his family. It places a double weight.' He added that he was 'a hard worker and provider' and that he had been involved in the community based Dalton Carnival. 'He is a man who goes out of his way to help others.' Brooks must also pay a victim surcharge of £100. The restraining order will run until further notice.

Article text: California will run out of water in 12 months, according to a NASA scientist. Jay Famiglietti, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said he'd 'like to live in a state that has a paddle so that it might also still have a creek' Scientists from NASA, Cornell University and Columbia University released research in February that said there could be worse droughts to come. A 'Megadrought' that could last several decades and would be worse than any other such phenomenon in 1000 years is expected sometimes between 2050 and 2099, according to their research published in Science. The current dryness affects not only the West Coast, but also the rest of the country. California grows the majority of many fruits and vegetables for the US. Their produce makes up 69 per cent of carrots, 71 per cent of spinach, 99 per cent of artichokes and more than 90 per cent of broccoli, according to Slate. Famiglietti said that 'the public remains detached from discussions and decisions' about conserving water and urged them to take ownership of the crisis.

Article text: Nick Clegg today bet a Ukip candidate six pints that the Lib Dems would have many more MPs than Nigel Farage’s ‘pipsqueak’ party. Mr Clegg made the provocative boast that he will win more MPs than Ukip during his weekly radio phone-in on LBC. One poll this week put the Lib Dems on just 5 per cent, the lowest for 25 years, while Ukip were on 14 per cent . Ukip candidate Keith Fraser called into the programme to attack Mr Clegg’s stance on civil liberties and boast that the Lib Dems face wipeout. But Mr Clegg hit back: ‘Rather than making slightly silly political points on the radio… . ‘How about this, I will bet you, I don’t know, what shall I bet you, I will bet you several pints that the Liberal Democrats will have many, many, many, many, many more MPs than your party after the election. Ukip leader Nigel Farage boasted his party would win more than 10 MPs and could hold the balance of power . ‘I can not only bet, I can close to guarantee you that your party is going to be a little pipsqueak party after May 7 compared to the Liberal Democrats. ‘All your bluster, and all your anger and all your brave talk I think will dissolve.’ Mr Clegg initially appeared reluctant to commit his own money to the bet, but when LBC host Nick Ferrari offered to pay the money, Mr Clegg replied: Oh alright then, six pints. ‘Let me be absolutely clear Keith, you believe on behalf of Nigel Farage, that you Ukip will have more MPs than the Liberal Democrats after May 7, is that right?’ Keith replied: ‘I think there’s a very good chance of overtaking your party. Am I taking the bet? Two pints will go to each: if I lose, I’m buying Nick Ferrari two pints, I’m buying Nick Clegg two pints, how about that?’ But Mr Clegg insisted: ‘Bad luck Keith, you might as well set the money aside already. Brave talk.’ Later Mr Fraser told MailOnline: 'If I lose, or Ukip loses, I will be more than willing to buy Nick Clegg and Nick Ferrari a beer. 'In fact, after the election Nick Clegg will have plenty of time to have a beer.' However, Mr Farage later insisted his party was on course to win more than 10 seats and could hold the balance of power. Appearing on ITV's Loose Women, he said: 'It'll be more than a handful. It'll be in double figures.' He added: 'Ukip is not going to win the election. What Ukip is going to do is win a number of MPs. 'And given no-one is going to have a majority we might just find ourselves in a position where nick Clegg was five years ago if we do that I'll do a better job than Nick Clegg did.'

Article text: A seven months-pregnant woman whose baby was cut from her womb made a desperate 911 call after the brutal attack on Wednesday pleading for help as she was 'bleeding out'. Lane's then-husband wasn't home at the time of the drowning, the newspaper reported at the time. She and their two daughters, then five and three, searched for the boy until they found him in the fish pond. He had been playing a game with his sisters while their mother was busy in another part of the house, the newspaper said. Lane also lost her grandmother earlier this month, according to her social media posts. According to social media, Lane had remarried and was assistant manager at a franchise of a company, Once Upon A Child, which buys and sells 'gently-used' children's clothing. KDVR reported on Wednesday that a baby registry was set up in Lane's name last year and listed her due date as November 14, 2014. The clothing in the baby registry was for a boy. Public records revealed that Lane held a certified license as a nurse aide which expired in 2012. After speaking to the victim, police were able to arrest Lane at the hospital at 7.46pm on Wednesday. Lane was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault, and child abuse knowingly and recklessly resulting in death, the Boulder District Attorney's Office confirmed on Thursday. Police are looking for any other mothers who may have responded to Lane's ad for baby clothes. A seven months' pregnant woman had her baby cut from her womb by another woman in a horrific attack which killed the fetus at this home in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday . Police said the 34-year-old woman who lives at the home stabbed the pregnant woman and 'removed' her baby. An armed officer outside the property in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday afternoon .

Investigators said they have an 'idea' of the motive of the attack but were not ready to release it until charges are filed . A man gives information to police near the scene of the horrific attack in Colorado on Wednesday afternoon . Under Colorado law, the charges are complicated by the fact if a child was not  born alive, then homicide charges could not be brought. The Boulder County DA's office does not expect to file charges until next week. Investigators have not released the name of the suspect or the pregnant woman but said they did not know each other. The 26-year-old mother-to-be had gone to the home alone to answer the Craigslist ad in Longmont, a town 30 miles outside Denver. A police officer removed what appears to be an evidence bag from the scene (left). Police planned to search the house on Wednesday night after bringing in a mobile crime scene unit (right) Police entered the suspect's home on Wednesday night after obtaining a search warrant. They hoped the search will better explain what motivated the suspect to engage in such a crazed attack. 'This is a tragic case for a mother right now,' Cmdr Satur told Fox 31 Denver. 'She came by this house. She was attacked, and her baby was removed from her.' The alleged assailant has two daughters, Commander Satur said. Her husband apparently drove her and the fetus to the hospital. Lane is scheduled to appear at the Boulder County Jail at 2pm on Thursday. It was not known whether the victim had any other children. The 26-year-old victim was taken to Longmont United Hospital where she underwent surgery and was expected to recover. Her baby did not survive the attack .

Article text: (CNN)President Barack Obama said Saturday that he learned Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email account for government business "through news reports" and was glad his former secretary of state asked for those emails to be made public. On Wednesday night, the former secretary of state tweeted that she "asked State to release" her email, a request accepted by the department. Obama backed Clinton's request, telling CBS that he thinks "the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need." While Obama commented on the issue Saturday, Clinton didn't mention it during an 18-minute appearance on stage at a Clinton Global Initiative event at the University of Miami. Clinton took no questions from reporters at the event. Instead, Clinton's remarks to about 1,000 students focused on the foundation's work, including a new report she will roll out Monday about the underrepresentation of women and girls. "There's so much that needs to be done," Clinton said on the issue of equaling the playing field for women and girls. As she regularly does, Clinton said there is "a lot of unfinished business" to do on the issue. Obama sat down with CBS after the president spoke at the 50th anniversary of the "Bloody Sunday" marches in Selma, Alabama. "If Selma taught us anything, it's that our work is never done," the President said while standing near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the symbol of the Selma marches. "Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we're getting closer." Clinton did not go to Selma, instead opting to attend her Clinton Foundation event in Florida. "Watched @repjohnlewis & @BarackObama in #Selma," she tweeted. "Let's answer their call to keep fighting for voting rights, civil rights, & human rights." Clinton mentioned the anniversary on stage, tying the marches and event into her work toward leveling the playing field for women and girls. "You can see how progress is made by looking at what happened this weekend in Selma, Alabama, where our country is marking a historic anniversary of the long march towards equality and a more perfect union, and also recommitting to carry the cause forward into the 21st century," Clinton said. "So whether it's women's rights or human rights, civil rights or LGBT rights, we're counting on all of you to lead the way, and that's what the no-ceilings initiative at the Clinton Foundation is really all about."
